# Chapter 63: Letters 559 according to God's Book and the Prophet's Sunnah.
Do this, and God willing, it will increase your reward and bring you
closer to the way of guidance. 2.26 From ʿAlī's missive to one of his
tax collectors whom he had sent to collect the alms-levy:1 2.26.1 ʿAlī
commands his tax collector to be conscious of God in private affairs and
hidden acts, for there is no true witness, and no real agent, other than
God. ʿAlī commands his tax collector to make sure that while he shows
obedience to God in public, he should never do the opposite in private.
To discharge his trust and offer worship with sincerity, the tax
collector's private and public life should not contradict, and his
actions and words should not be in opposition. ʿAlī also commands him to
make sure he never abuses or reviles his subjects. He should never raise
himself above them because of his charge, for they are his brothers in
faith and his helpers in the collection of dues. 2.26.2 You have a
prescribed share, a recognized right, in this levy. You also have
partners---the poor, the weak, and the destitute. I will give you your
share in full, but you should leave them their full share, else you will
be among those who face an army of adversaries on the day of
resurrection. Woe to the man whose adversaries before God are the
mendicant, the poor, the beggar, the helpless, the debtor, and the
wayfarer!2 If you scorn your trust and forage in the pastures of
embezzlement, if you don't keep your soul and your faith clean from its
filth, you will secure shame for yourself in this world, and even
greater shame and humiliation in the hereafter. The most dreadful
embezzlement is embezzlement of property that belongs to the community.
The most terrible deception is deceiving the Imam. 2.27 From ʿAlī's
testament to Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr, when he placed him in charge of
Egypt:3 1 In Kufa during his caliphate, 35--40/656--661, when he sent
Mikhnaf ibn Sulaym al-Azdī to collect the alms-levy (ṣadaqah). Nuʿmān,
Daʿāʾim, 1:252. 2 These are among the eight categories of recipients for
the alms-levy named in the Qurʾan, Tawbah 9:60. Discussion in B 811;
Ḥ15:161. The Arabic word madfūʿūn---translated here as "helpless" (after
R 3:61; Ḥ15:161, in the Qurʾanic category of "in the path of the God,"
fī sabīl Allāh)---could also be interpreted, pace Ḥ15:161, as "weakly
faithful," i.e., the category of those "whose hearts are reconciled"
(al-muʾallafati qulūbuhum) to Islam. 3 Presumably written in Kufa
between 36/656 and 38/658, in answer to questions Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr
posed to him in a letter. Thaqafī, Ghārāt, 1:235--248; Māmaṭīrī, Nuzhah,
264--281, Jurjānī, Iʿtibār 561--572 (Māmaṭīrī and Jurjānī include the
text of ʿAlī's full letter, and Muḥam- mad's letter of request). These
lines are similar to §2.46. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera

2: Letters 561 2.27.1 Lower your wing over them, offer them your softer
side, show them your face, and give equal attention to all in glance and
look, such that the powerful are not emboldened to expect unfair favors
and the weak do not despair of getting justice. God will ask all his
servants about small and large deeds, those open and those concealed. If
he punishes, it is because you are the sinners. If he forgives, it is
because he is the benefactor. 2.27.2 Servants of God! Know that the
pious partake of the joys of this world and the next. They share the
world with the worldly, but the worldly do not share the hereafter with
them. In this world, they reside in the most splendid of residences and
consume the finest of delicacies. They possess the opulent comforts of
the wealthy and partake of the lavish luxuries of the mighty. Yet, when
they depart, they leave with a full supply of provisions and a large
profit. They enjoy the pleasures of this world without becoming immersed
in worldli- ness, content in the certain knowledge that they will be
God's neighbors in the next---no prayer rejected, no pleasure withheld.
2.27.3 Servants of God! Beware of death, for it is imminent! Ready your
provi- sions, for death will bring a momentous affair, a fateful
end---good with no evil attached to it forever after, or evil with no
good attached to it forever after. Tell me: Who is closer to paradise
than its seeker? Who is closer to hellfire than its seeker? Death stalks
you. If you remain motionless, it will snatch you, if you flee, it will
find you---it is more firmly attached to you than your shadow. Death is
bound to your forelock while behind you the earth continues to be rolled
up, like a scroll. Beware of the Fire whose pit is bottomless, whose
heat is intense, and whose punishment is ever renewed! It is an abode
where there is no mercy, no prayer is heard, no pain is healed. If you
can fear God intensely and also place your hopes in him at the same
time, then do so, combine the two. Indeed, a servant's hope in his Lord
is only as strong as his fear of his Lord. Those who harbor the greatest
hopes of God's bounty are the ones who fear him most. 2.27.4 Muḥammad
ibn Abī Bakr! Know that I have placed you in charge of the
regionmostimportanttome---Egypt.Thisiswhatisduefromyou:opposeyour
passionsanddefendyourreligion,evenif youhaveonlyasinglehourleftinthis

prayer at its appointed time. Do not pray it early just because you have
time or delay it because you are occupied. Know that every single one of
your duties is subordinate to prayer. 2.27.5 From the same testament:
They are not equal---an Imam who leads to guidance and an Imam who leads
to perdition, a man who loves the Prophet and a man who hates the
Prophet. God's Messenger said to me: ⟨I do not fear harm for my
community from either believer or unbeliever. As for the believer, God
holds him back because of his belief. As for the unbeliever, God thwarts
him because of his unbelief. I fear harm for you from every man whose
heart harbors hypocrisy while his tongue spouts knowledge, who says what
you know to be good, but does what you know is evil.⟩1 2.28 From ʿAlī's
reply to Muʿāwiyah. This is one of the most eloquent letters of all
time:2 2.28.1 I received your letter in which you speak of how God
selected Muḥam- mad to propagate his religion and aided him through his
Companions. How astonishing the things time reveals about you! You
presume to inform us about the bounties God has bestowed upon us and of
the fact that he has blessed us with our Prophet---you are ⟨like the man
who carried dates to sell in Hajar⟩, themotherlodeof
dates,3orthemanwhochallengedhisinstructortoduelwith bow and arrow!You
allege that So-and-So and So-and-So are the most excellent Muslims.4 If
what you say is true, you have disqualified yourself from consid-
eration, whereas if what you say is false, the breach is none of your
concern. What have you to do with deciding who possesses more and who
less excel- lence, who is to lead and who is to be led! How dare

carries dates to Hajar⟩, is an ancient proverb, also rendered, ⟨like one
who carries dates to sell in Hajar⟩(ka-mustabḍiʿi tamrin ilā Hajar),
similar in meaning to the English idiom, ⟨carrying coal to Newcastle⟩.
Hajar is a town near Bahrain famous for its dates. I have added "the

565 Freedmen presume to draw distinctions between the first Emigrants,
by classi- fying their stations and determining their ranks!1 Woe! ⟨An

limping hoof, recognize the shortness of your stride, and retreat to
where destiny has placed you? What have you to do with the defeat of the
defeated or the victory of the victorious! You are plunging deep into
the waterless desert and straying far from the right path! 2.28.2 Do you
not see---and I say this not to give you information but to speak of
God's blessings3---that many Emigrants were martyred in God's cause, and
each one had merit, but when our martyr was killed, he was named the
King of Martyrs, and God's Messenger singled him out by performing
seventy suppli- cations when he prayed over his body?4 Do you not see
that many warriors had their hands severed in God's cause, and each one
had merit, but when the same injury was inflicted on one of us, he was
named He-Who-Soars-in- Paradise and He-of-the-Two-Wings?5 And if God had
not forbidden men to praise themselves, I could mention someone else
whose abundant virtues are known to believers' hearts and not rejected
by the ears of them who listen!6 Leave off talking about ⟨one whose
arrows pursued an animal that veered to one side⟩!7 We are beholden only
to our Lord and all people are beholden to 1 On "Freedmen," see note at
§2.18. 2 Ancient Arabian proverb. B 820; Ḥ15:191; F 373; R 3:72. 3
Reference to Qurʾan, Ḍuḥā 93:11. 4 The passage is about the excellence
of the Prophet's and ʿAlī's clan of Hāshim. He compares their virtue and
their service in the cause of Islam to the ignobility and anti-Islamic
activities of Muʿāwiyah's Umayyad clan. The "King of Martyrs" (Sayyid
al-Shuhadāʾ) is the Prophet's and ʿAlī's uncle Ḥamzah ibn ʿAbd
al-Muṭṭalib, who was killed fighting for him at the Battle of Uḥud.
Translated here as "supplications," the term takbīr, lit. "proclaiming
that \[God\] is the greatest (Allāhu akbar)," is invoked during a
funeral prayer, where it leads into a supplication for the deceased
(takbīr is also used in other contexts); the usual number of
supplications in a funeral prayer is five, and the seventy that the
Prophet prayed over Ḥamzah were unprece- dented and never repeated.
Ḥ15:193; B 820; F 373; R 3:73. 5 "He-Who-Soars-in-Paradise" (Ṭayyār),
also called "He-of-the-Two-Wings" (Dhū al-Janāḥayn) is ʿAlī's brother
and the Prophet's cousin, Jaʿfar ibn Abī Ṭālib, killed at the Battle of
Muʾtah. Ḥ 15:193; B 821; F 373; R 3:73. 6 The one with "abundant
virtues" is ʿAlī himself, who fought valiantly in the Muslims' early
battles. Ḥ15:193; B 820--821; R 3:74. 7 Ar. mālat bihi l-ramiyyah, lit.
⟨his arrows pursued an animal that veered to one side⟩, is a proverb
denoting one who pursues the elusive prey of worldly gain. Ibn Abī
al-Ḥadīd (Ḥ 15:194) says ʿAlī alludes here to ʿUthmān, who was from the
clan of Umayyah. Baḥrānī (B 821) says the reference is to ʿAmr ibn
al-Āṣ, and if so, the translation should be amended to "Leave off
talking with (instead of: about) one whose arrows pursues an animal that
veers to one side." al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera
