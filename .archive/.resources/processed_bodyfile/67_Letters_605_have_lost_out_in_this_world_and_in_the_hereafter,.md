# Chapter 67: Letters 605 have lost out in this world and in the hereafter,
when you could have achieved your desires through rightful means.
Beware! If God grants me victory over you and Abū Sufyān's son, I will
requite you like for like. But should you elude me and manage to stay
alive, beware: what lies ahead is much worse. Go in peace. 2.40 From a
letter sent by ʿAlī to one of his governors:1 Iam
informedthatyouhavedonesomething,which,if youhavedoneit,means you have
angered your Lord, disobeyed your Imam, and betrayed your trust. I am
informed that you stripped the land bare, devoured whatever was under
your control, and consumed whatever you could lay your hands on. Send me
your accounts, then, and know that God's accounting is more stringent
than man's! 2.41 From a letter sent by ʿAlī to one of his governors:2 I
had shared my charge with you and kept you as close to me as an intimate
garment, I trusted none of my family to support and serve me, to stay
true to his charge, more than I trusted you. But when you saw that the
age had turned rabid against your cousin, the enemy was attacking with
savage madness, the people were becoming increasingly corrupt, and the
community had risen up in revolt and abandoned me, you turned your
shield in your cousin's face.3 You left me, along with all the others;
you abandoned me, along with all the others; you betrayed me, along with
all the others. You failed to support your cousin or fulfill your trust.
When you fought beside me earlier, you appear to have had something
other than God's cause in mind, to have never truly held a mandate from
your Lord; you appear to have been deceiving this community in order to
defraud them, as though, all along, you had intended to cheat them of
their war gains. For when you saw the opportunity to swindle, you were
swift to charge and quick to attack. You swooped and ran off with
whatever money you could 1 The governor is ʿAbdallāh ibn al-ʿAbbās in
Basra and ʿAlī's letter---sent from Kufa sometime after Nahrawān, in
38/658---was prompted by a complaint written to him by his treasurer
there, Abū al-Aswad al-Duʾalī (Balādhurī, Ansāb, 2:170; Ibn ʿAbd Rabbih,
ʿIqd, 5:103). §2.43, ʿAlī's letter to Maṣqalah ibn Hubayrah, governor in
Ardashīr, Fars, contains similar language. 2 Excerpt from a letter
likely sent from Kufa to Mecca in 40/661 to ʿAbdallāh ibn al-ʿAbbās, a
short while before ʿAlī's death; §2.22, and its variant rendering,
§2.66, is possibly another part from the same letter (text and context
in Yaʿqūbī, Tārīkh, 2:205), and perhaps also §2.72. Details of event in
note to §2.22. Text of §2.41 in Balādhurī, Ansāb, 2:175--176; Ibn
al-ʿAbbās's reply, and ʿAlī's further reply in B 867. 3 An action
usually taken in the face of an enemy, denotes disloyalty; cf. proverb:
⟨Turned the face of his shield⟩(qalaba ẓahr al-mijann). Ḥ16:169; ʿA 690;
R 3:136--137; F 382. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera

607 grab---money held in trust for their widows and orphans---like a
lean-hipped wolf pouncing and snatching a bleeding, limping goat. You
blithely carried it away to Mecca, without deeming your appropriation a
crime, as though you--- may other people be deprived of fathers!---were
gifting to your family property inherited from your father and mother!1
Great God! Do you not believe in the return to him? Do you not fear
interrogation at the reckoning? I counted you among the intelligent! How
can you eat and drink when you know that what

money that belongs to orphans and beggars, to believers, to warriors on
whom God has bestowed these properties, and through whom God has pro-

and if God places you in my power, I shall redeem myself before him by
punishing
youappropriately.Ishallstrikeyouwithmysword,aswordthathasthrustevery man

have gotten their way! I would have wrested from them what was due and
redressed the injustice wrought by their actions. I swear this by God,
Lord of all the peoples---I would not even wish to own lawfully what you
have usurped of the community's property, or to leave it as inheritance
for those who live after
me.⟨Pasturelightlyintheforenoon!⟩2Think:howwillitbewhenyoureachthe end

escape!»4 2.42 From a missive sent by ʿAlī to ʿUmar ibn Abī Salamah
al-Makhzūmī, his governor in Bahrain, discharging him and replacing him
with al-Nuʿmān ibn ʿAjlān al-Zuraqī:5 I have appointed al-Nuʿmān ibn
ʿAjlān over Bahrain and discharged you with- out censure or reproach.You
undertook your duties as governor admirably and fulfilled the trust I
had placed in you. Come to me, then, without blame, liabil- 1 "To
Mecca," lit. "to the Ḥijāz," western Arabia, where Mecca and Medina are
located. 2 Ar. ḍaḥḥi ruwaydan, an idiom enjoining restraint. Two
interpretations: (1) The verb ḍaḥḥā means to allow camels to pasture
only very lightly in the forenoon (ḍuḥā), to ensure they can resume
walking swiftly without needing to rest. Ḥ16:169; B 868; R 3:138--139.
(2) F 382 explains the idiom as "slaughter gently," from the verb ḍaḥḥā,
meaning to sacrifice an animal, which, when followed by "gently"
(ruwaydan), similarly denotes restraint. 3 Reference to Qurʾan, Sajdah
32:12. 4 Qurʾan, Ṣād 38:3. 5 From Kufa to Bahrain in 36/656, in the
lead-up to the Battle of Ṣiffīn. ʿUmar ibn Abī Salamah was the Prophet's
stepson and ward, son of his wife Umm Salamah from her previous mar-
riage. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -

609 ity, culpability, or guilt. I intend to march against the despots of
Syria and want you beside me in the battle. You are one of those whose
support I rely on to fight the enemy and erect the pillar of religion.
We shall do so, God willing! 2.43 From a missive sent by ʿAlī to
Maṣqalah ibn Hubayrah al-Shaybānī, his governor in Ardashīr-khurrah:1
Iam informedthatyouhavedonesomething,which,if youhavedoneit,means that
you have angered your Lord and enraged your Imam. I am informed that you

bytheMuslims'arms,theircavalry,andtheirblood.Iswearbyhimwhosplitthe

and those who live in mine---have equal share in the war booty. They
come to my watering hole to receive it, and leave, having drunk their
fill. Go in peace. 2.44 From ʿAlī's missive to Ziyād ibn Abīhi, when he
learned that Muʿāwiyah had writ- ten to Ziyād, enticing him to defect by
connecting Ziyād's lineage to his own:2 I have learned that Muʿāwiyah
wrote to you in an attempt to befuddle your mind and dull your blade.
Beware of him! He is Satan, approaching a man from the front and the
back, the right and the left,3 storming in wherever he finds laxity, and
plundering wherever he finds negligence. Once, during the reign of 1
Presumably sent from Kufa in or just before 38/658. The first line is
similar to §2.40, and Maṣqalah is also castigated in §1.44 (details of
event in notes there). Ardashīr-khurrah was a district in Fars. 2
Presumably from Kufa to Fars, between 38/658 and 40/661. The
correspondence between Muʿāwiyah and Ziyād likely began when Maṣqalah
defected to Muʿāwiyah in 38/658 (see Ibn ʿAsākir, Tārīkh, 58:269--270).
Ziyād was ʿAlī's governor in Fars who, soon after ʿAlī's death, left
ʿAlī's son Ḥasan and defected to Muʿāwiyah in 44/665. Muʿāwiyah won him
over by officially declaring that Ziyād was his own (illegitimate
half-)brother and appointing him governor in Iraq. The Nahj al-Balāghah
text---like most primary sources---calls him "Ziyād ibn Abīhi," lit.
"Ziyād,sonof hisfather"(insteadof "Ziyād,sonof ʿAbīd,"thenameof
hislegalfather)because of the uncertainty regarding his parentage;
several candidates are mentioned in the sources, including Muʿāwiyah's
father, Abū Sufyān. Ziyād's mother, Sumayyah, a slave, is characterized
as promiscuous, and---this is the incident mentioned in ʿAlī's
letter---Abū Sufyān had once boasted to ʿAlī that he, Abū Sufyān, had
"placed Ziyād inside Sumayyah's womb." Details of these events, texts of
the letters exchanged between Muʿāwiyah and Ziyād, and between ʿAlī and
Ziyād, and Ziyād's orations, in Ḥ16:179--204 (after Ibn ʿAbd al-Barr,
Balādhurī, Wāqidī, Madāʾinī, and Ṭabarī); B 870--871; F 383--384; R
