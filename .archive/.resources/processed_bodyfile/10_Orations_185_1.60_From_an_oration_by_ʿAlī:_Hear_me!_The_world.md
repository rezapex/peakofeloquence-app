---
# Chapter 10: Orations 185 1.60 From an oration by ʿAlī: Hear me! The world
is an abode from which you cannot be saved except within it, yet no
tribute you offer it will grant you passage beyond its rim. The world
tests people with gifts:Whatever they take from it for worldly benefit
they must leave behind and account for. Whatever they take from it for
the next abode will stay with them forever. To the intelligent, the
world is a shifting shadow--- one moment you see it spreading and the
next it has narrowed to a shard, one moment you see it growing and the
next it has disappeared. 1.61 From an oration by ʿAlī:1 1.61.1 Be
conscious of God, O servants of God, and outrace your imminent end with
good deeds. Trade transient benefits for everlasting gain, prepare to
depart, for the call has been given, and brace for death, for it hovers
overhead. Be those who wake when shaken, who, knowing that the world is
not their
home,seekabetterabode.Godhasnotcreatedyouinvain,norleftyouwithout
direction.2 Nothing stands between you and paradise or hellfire but the
arrival of death. Diminished by each passing moment, demolished by each
pressing hour, your time to the goalpost is short. That traveler, death,
whose camels are steered by Night after Day and by Day after Night will
soon be here. Prepare well for this visitor who will bring you immortal
triumph or unending misery. 1.61.2 Gather provisions in this world from
this world to sustain your souls tomorrow. A servant should fear his
Master and be true to his soul, he should hasten to repent and conquer
his passions, for his lifespan is veiled from him, his long hopes are
false, and he is turned over to Satan, who adorns and encour- ages him
to ride the steed of sin, while coaxing him to delay repentance. When he
least expects it, fate will attack. O what agony for the heedless man!
His life will testify against him, and his days will hand him over to
unending misery. 1.61.3 We beseech Almighty God to include us among
those who are not made insolent by his bounty, fall short in his
obedience, or are seized in death by grief and regret. 1 Additional
parts recorded in Sibṭ,Tadhkirah, 145. Some lines are similar in §1.202;
see note on context there. 2 Modified quotes from Qurʾan, Muʾminūn

187 1.62 From an oration by ʿAlī:1 1.62.1 No state for God precedes
another state: he is neither first before he is last nor visible before
he is hidden. Other than him, nothing can be described as one.2 Other
than him, the mighty are humble, the strong are weak, mas- ters are
slaves, the learned are students, and the powerful can fail. Other than
him, all observers are blind to subtle colors and ethereal bodies, and
all listen- ers strain to hear faint sounds, are deafened by loud
noises, and miss distant echoes. Other than him, nothing that is visible
is hidden, and nothing that is hidden is visible. 1.62.2 God did not
create us to strengthen his authority or prevent time's blows, nor for
help against an equal's attack, a partner's multitudes, or a mali- cious
adversary. Far from it! We are but subservient mortals and humble ser-
vants. He does not enter into things, so we cannot say that he exists
therein, nor is he distant from them, so we cannot say that he lives
apart. Creating did not tire him, nor directing the universe. Weakness
did not delay his design, nor doubt enter into his decree. His judgment
is perfect, his knowledge exact, his command irrevocable. He is
entreated in times of distress and venerated in times of bounty. 1.63
From ʿAlī's address to his followers on one of the battle days of
Ṣiffīn:3 Muslims! Sheathe yourselves in God's awe and envelop your
bodies with calm. Bite down hard on your back teeth, for that will
deflect the blades that strike at your heads. Wear full armor and rattle
your swords inside their sheaths before you draw them out. Stare down
the enemy and launch your spears from the right and the left. Fight with
your swords and leap into the thrust so that they 1 Ibn ʿAbd Rabbih
(ʿIqd, 4:163--164) narrates lines from §1.62.2 as part of ʿAlī's Radiant
Oration (Gharrāʾ), §1.80. Ṣadūq (Tawḥīd, 41, 43) places it in Kufa,
after the arbitration in 37/658, as the praise opening for an oration
urging supporters to rally against Muʿāwiyah. 2 Ar. qalīl, translation
after R 1:290, Ḥ5:155. Alternatively explained as anything
understandable in terms of number, unlike God from whom any attribution
is to be removed (B 285); or weak (M 1:330). 3 Narrated by ʿAbdallāh ibn
al-ʿAbbās, who said, "I saw ʿAlī on the battle day of Ṣiffīn, a white
turban on his head, his eyes like two glowing lamps, urging his
followers to fight." (Māmaṭīrī, Nuzhah, 416). Either on the day of the
first skirmish in Ṣiffīn, or, more likely, on the penul- timate
battle-day that preceded the final Night of Clamor (laylat al-harīr),
Thursday-Friday 7--8 Ṣafar 37/27--28 July 657. B 289. Further orations
in Ṣiffīn by ʿAlī and others, and poems and events, are recorded in

1: Orations 189 pierce your foe. Know this: you fight under God's watch,
and alongside his Mes- senger's cousin. Charge forward in attack. Do not
flee the battlefield, for that would dishonor your line for generations
and repay you with hellfire on judg- ment day. Be generous with your
lives and approach death with gentle courage. Aim for the black mass and
the pitched tent. Cut down its center pole, for Satan is hiding in its
flap. He has one hand in front, ready to attack, and one foot at the
back, ready to flee. Charge! Charge! Fight till the pillar of truth
shines bright. «You shall overcome. God is with you, and he will not let
your deeds go to waste.»1 1.64 From observations by ʿAlī regarding the
Allies. After the death of God's Messen- ger, when reports of the
Assembly at the Banū Sāʿidah Portico reached the Commander of the
Faithful, he asked:2 What did the Allies say? Those who had brought the
report replied: The Allies proposed: A commander from our side and
another from yours. ʿAlī responded: Did you not remind them of the
Messenger's directive to recompense those who do good among them and
pardon those who transgress? Those reporting asked: How is that evidence
against their claim? ʿAlī replied: The instruction would not be about
them if they had the right to command. Then he asked: How did the
Quraysh respond? 1 Qurʾan, Muḥammad 47:35. 2 ʿAlī spoke these lines in
Medina, following the death of the Prophet in 11/632, as mentioned in
Raḍī's comments. At this Assembly, immediately after the Prophet
Muḥammad's death, some of his Companions gathered at the Portico
(Saqīfah) of the Banū Sāʿidah and pledged allegiance to Abū Bakr as his
successor. Neither ʿAlī nor anyone else from the Prophet's family was
present; they were preparing for the Prophet's burial. See a summary of
these events in B 292--293; Lecomte, "al-Saḳīfa," ei2; a more detailed
version in Ḥ1:21--61, 6:5--17, and events immediately following in
Ḥ5:17--52. See also ʿAlī's rebuke to Muʿāwiyah regarding this event in

191 The reporters answered: They argued that they are the Messenger's
tree. ʿAlī exclaimed: They argue for the tree but forget about its
fruit! 1.65 From an address by ʿAlī when his recently appointed
governor, Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr, was killed, and Egypt was lost to the
Umayyads:1 My own choice for governor of Egypt was Hāshim ibn ʿUtbah.
Hāshim would not have left a gap for them to enter or an opportunity to
attack. I say this with- out criticizing Muḥammad, whom I loved and
reared.2 1.66 From an address by ʿAlī admonishing his supporters:3 How
long should I coax you and blandish you? How long must I handle you
gingerly as a young camel whose hump a heavy load would crush, or as a
worn garment, patched in one place, and falling apart in another? How is
it that each
manamongyoulocksyourdoorwhenaSyriansquadronapproaches,andholes up in his
home like a lizard in its burrow or a hyena in its den? By God, to gain
you as supporters is to lose! To shoot with you in my longbow is to
shoot an arrow with a broken nock and no arrowhead! By God, you throng
the square, but only a few stand firm under war's banners. I know well
what would lick you into shape and straighten your crookedness---but, by
God, I shall not do this at the cost of demeaning my soul. May God
begrime your faces and destroy your fortunes! You embrace not truth but
falsehood! You reject not falsehood but truth! 1 I have added the words,
"to the Umayyads," for clarity. Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr was killed in
38/658, after the arbitration, when ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣtook over Egypt for
Muʿāwiyah. ʿAlī deliv- ered this address in Kufa (Ṭabarī, Tārīkh,
5:109--110). On the events mentioned in the address, see B 294
(summary); Ḥ6:57--94 (details), Ḥ6:94--100 (text of ʿAlī's full oration
following Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr's death). 2 Muḥammadwasthesonof
AbūBakr,thefirstSunnicaliph,andAsmāʾbintʿUmays.Hisfather died when he
was a child, and ʿAlī, who married Asmāʾ, raised him. R 1:294--295;
Hawting, "Muḥammad b. Abī Bakr,"ei2. 3 Among a number of orations
(including §1.39) that ʿAlī delivered in the wake of Nuʿmān ibn Bashīr's
raid on ʿAyn al-Tamr in 39/659 (Yaʿqūbī, Tārīkh, 2:195--196; Ṭabarī,
Tārīkh, 5:133--134). He admonishes them for their reluctance to muster
to fight Muʿāwiyah (B 295). al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera

1: Orations 193 1.67 ʿAlī spoke these words in the predawn hour of the
day in which he was struck his deathblow:1 Sleep overtook me as I sat,
and the Messenger appeared before my eyes. "Messenger of God," I
exclaimed, "what treachery I have encountered from your community, what
hate!" He replied, "Invoke maledictions on them!" so I prayed, "God,
give me better associates than they, and give them a worse leader than
I!" Raḍī: By "treachery (awad)" he means deceit and by "hate (ladad)" he
means enmity. These are some of the most expressive words ever spoken.
1.68 From an address by ʿAlī censuring the Iraqis:2
Iraqis!Youarelikeapregnantwomanwho,atfullterm,deliversastillbornchild,
thenherhusbanddies,andshelivesforalongtimeasawidow---shediesalone, with
only distant relatives as her inheritors. By God, I did not choose to
come to you! I was forced come to you! I am told that you mutter behind
my back, "He lies!" May God fight you! Who do you accuse me of lying
about? God? I was the first to believe in him! The Prophet? I was the
first to accept his message! Never would I lie about them! But my words
are beyond your comprehension, and you are not worthy to hear them.3 Woe
to your mothers! I gave you a full measure, free of charge. If only
there were vessels to hold it! «You shall surely learn the truth of its
report, but only after a while.»4 1.69 From an oration by ʿAlī in which
he taught his companions how to invoke bless- ings on the Prophet:5 1
Kufa,40/661.Nuʿmān(Sharḥal-akhbār,2:432)namestheaddresseeasal-ḤasanibnʿAlī,along
with some unnamed associates. For details about ʿAlī's assassination,
see Ḥ6:113--126. 2 Excerpt from an oration ʿAlī delivered after Ṣiffīn
in 37/657, presumably in Kufa, chastising his Iraqi fighters who had
agreed to a truce, when, after a hard-fought battle, they were on the
verge of victory. See detailed parsing of the oration's 'pregnant woman'
metaphor in light of these events in B 297; R 1:301; Ḥ6:127--129. 3
According to the commentators, ʿAlī's "manner of speaking that is beyond
the addressees' comprehension" refers to his prophecies about future
events (B 297; Ḥ6:128--134). It could also refer to his orations
explicating the mysteries of theology and metaphysics. 4 Qurʾan, Ṣād
38:88. 5 Ibn Abī Shaybah (Muṣannaf, 6:66) prefaces the prayer with the
tag, "ʿAlī used to recite this supplication," meaning it was ʿAlī's
habitual prayer. Variant rendering in §1.103.3 (see details of context
there; §1.103 is part of a larger oration that also includes §3.26, on
the four pillars of belief, and §3.259). al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015)
