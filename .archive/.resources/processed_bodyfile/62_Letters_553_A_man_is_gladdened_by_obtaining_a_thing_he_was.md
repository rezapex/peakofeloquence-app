title: Letters 553 A man is gladdened by obtaining a thing he was
---
# Chapter 62: Letters 553 A man is gladdened by obtaining a thing he was
not going to lose and saddened by the loss of a thing he was not going
to obtain. Be glad for what you have achieved for the hereafter. Be sad
for what you have lost of it. Whatever you achieve of this world, don't
exult over it excessively. Whatever you may lose of it, don't grieve too
much. Save your worries for what comes after death. 2.23 From ʿAlī's
address after Ibn Muljam struck him with his sword, spoken as a tes-
tament just before ʿAlī's death:1 This is my testament to you: Do not
assign partners to God or abandon the Sunnah of the Prophet---keep these
two pillars upright, and you shall be free of blame. Yesterday I was
your companion, today I serve as a plain lesson for you, and tomorrow I
shall be gone from your midst. If I survive, I shall claim my own
blood-wit,2 and if I die, well, death is what we are promised. If I
forgive, my action will gain me nearness to God, and if you do the same,
you too will
earnGod'sreward.Chooseforgiveness---«DoyounotwishthatGodshouldfor- give
you?»3 By God, death has not surprised me as an unwelcome visitor, or as
a sudden arrival that I find unpleasant. I am like a person who has
arrived at the watering hole he sought, who found the object he pursued.
«What God has prepared for people of virtue is the best!»4 Raḍī: Part of
this address was previously recorded in the Orations section.5This
version contains some additions, which is why I have found it necessary
to repeat it here. 2.24 From a testament ʿAlī wrote after turning back
from Ṣiffīn, regarding the distri- bution of his properties:6 This is
what I---God's servant, ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib, Commander of the Faithful---
have directed with regard to my property in the pursuance of God's
pleasure, in the hope that God will allow me entry into the celestial
garden and grant me his protection. 1 Delivered as part of a testament
in his home in Kufa, where he was carried after he was struck the
deathblow, in 40/661. Kulaynī, Kāfī, 1:299. 2 Blood-wit and forgiveness
are mentioned in the context of punishment for ʿAlī's killer, Ibn
Muljam. 3 Qurʾan, Nūr 24:22. 4 Qurʾan, ʿĀl ʿImrān 3:198. 5 §1.147. 6

details of his properties in Ḥ15:149. The testament starts out in the
conventional third grammatical person, which I have changed to first
person for clarity, since the final line in Arabic is in the first
person. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -

2: Letters 555 From the same testament:
Mypropertyshallbeadministeredbyal-ḤasanibnʿAlī.1Heshoulduseaportion from
it in licit ways and disburse from it also in licit ways. If something
happens to Ḥasan while Ḥusayn lives, Ḥusayn shall administer the
property thereafter and in the same way. Fāṭimah's sons are both to have
the same share from my
trustsasmyothersons,butIhaveselectedthemforthechargeof administering my
trusts in order to obtain God's pleasure, gain closeness to God's
Messen- ger, honor his sanctity, and privilege his kinship. The
administrator is to leave the property's principal in its original form
and spend only from its fruits as he has been directed and instructed.
He may not sell the estates' date-palm shoots until the entire land has
ripened with them and become a fully green planta- tion. If any of my
concubines with whom I cohabit has a child or is pregnant, then the cost
of freeing her is to be deducted from her child's share. If her child
dies and she lives, she is still free, for her bondage has already been
removed, and my freeing her has certified her liberty.2 Raḍī: As for
ʿAlī's words in this testament, "He may not sell the estates' date-palm
shoots (wadiyyah)": wadiyyaharesaplings,andthepluralis
wadī.Hiswords:"untilthelandhas ripened with them and become (an
tushkila) a green plantation" is among the most eloquent of expressions.
It means that date-palm plantings will grow with such abun-
danceinthatlandthatthebeholderwillthinkitalandscapedifferenttotheonebefore;
he will be thrown into doubt (ashkala, which also means ripen) and will
think it is a different piece of land altogether. 2.25 From a testament
ʿAlī would customarily inscribe for tax collectors he appointed to
oversee collection of the alms-levy. I have recorded some sections from
it here to show how ʿAlī raised the pillar of right and followed the
path of justice in matters small and large, and in affairs trivial and
momentous:3 2.25.1 Set out in consciousness of God, who is one and has
no partner. Don't threaten a Muslim, don't survey his property without
his consent, and don't take from his possessions more than what is due
to God. 1 This is ʿAlī's son Ḥasan from his wife Fāṭimah Zahrāʾ,
daughter of the Prophet. Following con- vention for official documents,
ʿAlī refers to him as "Ḥasan ibn (= son of) ʿAlī" rather than saying "my
son Ḥasan." 2 Translation after Ḥ15:150. 3 In Kufa, during his
caliphate, 35--40/656--661, when he sent tax collectors to agricultural
lands to collect the alms-levy (ṣadaqāt) annually required of Muslims.

557 2.25.2 When you arrive in the lands of a tribe, pitch your tent at
their water- ing hole and don't enter their residential areas. Then walk
toward them calmly and with dignity and stand in their midst. Then hail
them in peace and don't stintwithyourgreeting.Thensay,"Servantsof
God,God'svicegerent,hiscaliph, has sent me to secure God's due from your
property. Is there anything you owe God from your property that you
should submit to his vicegerent?" If a per- son says no, don't ask him
again. If a person is forthcoming, set out with him, but don't frighten,
threaten, force, or oppress him---accept whatever gold or silver he
submits to you freely. If he has goats or camels, don't enter their pens
without his permission, for most of the animals belong to him. When you
do enter, don't behaverudely or with violence. Don'tfrightentheanimals
orstartle them, and don't cause the owner distress by maltreating them.
Divide the ani- mals into two groups and have the owner select one set.
When he has made his selection, don't object. Then divide the remaining
the animals again into two groups, and have the owner select one set.
When he has made his selection, don't object. Keep doing this until
God's due is fulfilled by the number of ani- mals that remain in your
share, then accept them as God's due from the owner. If, after that, he
asks you to rescind the operation, rescind it. Then bring all the
animals together once again and repeat what you had done earlier until
you have secured his acceptance of God's due from his property. Make
sure, how- ever, that you don't accept animals that are old, decrepit,
broken-boned, sickly, or defective. 2.25.3 Assign the animals only to
the care of someone you know to be pious and who will be gentle with
these flocks that belong to the Muslim community, until he delivers them
to their leader, and that leader distributes the animals among them.
Entrust the animals only to the care of someone who is kind and sincere,
a vigilant custodian who won't treat them roughly, overburden them,
fatigue them, or drive them too hard. Then hasten to send me all the
animals that have been collected under your supervision so that I may
distribute them in the manner commanded by God. When your deputy takes
charge of them, instruct him not to separate a camel from her calf, or
to milk her to the extent that it harms the calf, or to ride her so hard
that she collapses. He should divide his riding evenly between her and
her fellow mares. He should allow tired ani- mals to rest and be
unhurried in herding the animals with worn hooves or a limp. He should
let them drink whenever they pass a pool of water and not force them
from green shoots to the beaten road. He should let them have a respite
every few hours and pause wherever there is water and grass. He should
do this until he delivers the animals to me, with God's permission,
healthy and fat with marrow, neither fatigued nor distressed, so that I
may distribute them al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera
