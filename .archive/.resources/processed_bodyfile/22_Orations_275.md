sumeshissoul.Hethusbecomesaslavetotheworldandtoallwhopossessany- thing
of her, wherever she goes he follows, and wherever she turns he turns.
He pays no heed to God's warning and takes no counsel from God's
lessons. All the while, he sees the heedless abruptly taken from her to
a place from which there is no return, and he sees the terror they had
denied descend upon them. He sees them leave the world in which they had
taken comfort, and move to the afterlife as they had been warned. The
horror that descends upon the dying person is beyond words. As the
anguished convulsions of death and the remorseful pangs of loss together
bear down upon him, his extremities begin to lose feeling, and his color
changes. Then, death penetrates further and prevents him from speech. He
lies among his family, seeing them with his eyes, hearing them with his
ears, still able to discern, still able to understand. He can think only
about his wasted life and squandered time. He remembers the wealth he
has amassed, both licit and illicit, from honest and dubious sources.
The sins he has gathered now weigh him down, now, when he is about to
leave everything behind. The people who survive him will enjoy his
wealth. Its gratification will belong to another, while the burden will
weigh down his back. His debt has come due for payment. He bites on his
knuckles, regretting the misdeeds that are now clear to him, caring
little for the things he craved all the days of his life. He wishes that
the person who envied him his wealth and coveted his property had taken
it all! Mean- while, death continues to penetrate his body and it
pierces his hearing. Now he lies among his family, his tongue unable to
speak, his ears unable to hear. His eyes go from face to face, he sees
their tongues moving but cannot hear their words. Then death tightens
its grip. His sight is taken away, just as his hearing had been earlier,
and his soul leaves his body. He becomes a corpse lying amid his family,
and they recoil from him in fear and back away---he cannot console those
who weep or answer those who call out. Then they carry him to a grave
marked with lines in the earth. They give him over to his deeds and
cease to visit. 1.106.4 Until destiny reaches its term and the affair
approaches its ordained hour,whenthelastof
creationhascaughtupwiththefirstandGod'scommand arrives to renew his
creation, he shakes the sky and splits it, convulses the earth and
agitates it, plucks out each mountain and uproots it, and, terrified by
his majesty and cowed by his power, each crushes the other. He extracts
all who are on earth, renewing them after their decay, gathering them
after their sepa- ration. Then he stands them, each in his place, to be
interrogated about deeds and secret acts. He divides them into two
groups, blessing the one and punish- ing the other. He rewards the
obedient with nearness to his divine self and with al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

277 eternal life in his abode, which its inhabitants never leave, where
their condi- tion never changes, misfortunes never befall, illness never
takes hold, dangers never approach, and journeys never displace. He
locks up the disobedient in the abode of horrors. He shackles their
hands to their necks, binds their fore- locks to their feet, clothes
them in garments of pitch, and dresses them in robes of fire. He throws
them into the chamber of torture, whose heat endlessly sears, whose door
remains bolted, and whose blaze rages with rabid hunger, clam- orous
tumult, sheets of flame, and terrifying thunder. Its resident never
leaves, its captive is never ransomed, its shackles are never broken.
This abode has no limit, so it never ceases to be. Its people have no
lifespan, so the terror never ends. 1.106.5 From the same oration in
praise of the Prophet: He viewed the world with contempt, demeaned it,
disparaged it, and deemed it lowly. He recognized that God had
deliberately turned the world away from him while allowing it
ungrudgingly to many, so he turned his heart away from it and drove all
thoughts of it from his mind. He preferred that its ornaments be absent
from his eyes, so he would not be tempted to don its splendid garments
or long for it to be his permanent residence. He conveyed his Lord's
message and proved his claim, instructed his community and gave them
warning, and called them to paradise with glad tidings of its bliss. We
are the tree of prophecy, the station of God's message, and the place
where angels alight. We are mines of knowledge and springs of wisdom.
Who- eversupportsandlovesusshouldexpectGod'smercy.Whoeverbearsusenmity
or malice should expect God's assault. 1.107 From an oration by ʿAlī:1
The deeds that bring you closest to God are the following: belief in him
and his messenger; jihad in his path, for it is Islam's summit; the
testament of sincerity---⟨There is no god but God⟩---for it is the
natural state; performing the ritual prayer, for it is the way of truth;
offering the alms levy, for it is a man- 1 Excerpt from one of ʿAlī's
famous sermons, named in several sources as "The Brocade (Dībāj)
Oration" that begins with the line, "Praise to God, creator of the
world" (الحمد لله فاطر الخلق ,) of which another part is §1.83.4
(Ḥarrānī, Tuḥaf, 149--150). The first paragraph is attributed to the
Prophet Muḥammad in Yaʿqūbī, Tārīkh, 2:96--97. "The testament of
sincerity" (kalimat al-ikhlāṣ) is ⟨There is no god but God⟩(Lā ilāha
illā Allāh), the central creed of Islam, which I have added in the
translation for clarity. The "natural state" ( fiṭrah) is to believe in
God, according to the prophetic hadith stating that each human child at
the time of birth is Mus- lim. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and

279 dated obligation; fasting in the month of Ramadan, for it is a
shield from God's punishment; performing the hajj and the ʿumrah
pilgrimage to Mecca, for they dispel poverty and wash away sins;
fostering close ties with kin, for it increases wealth and prolongs
life; giving alms in secret, for it expiates transgressions; disbursing
alms in public, for it wards off horrible forms of death; and acts of
charity, for they protect you from dishonor and shame. Fill yourself
with God's remembrance for it is the best remembrance. Wish for
everything he promised the pious, for his promise is the truest of
promises. Follow the guidance of your Prophet, for it is the best
guidance. Follow his Sun- nah,foritisthemostrighteousof
practices.LearntheQurʾan,foritistheheart's springtime. Heal yourselves
by its light, for it is a cure for souls. And recite it beautifully, for
it is the most beneficial exhortation. A learned man who acts contrary
to his learning is as bad as the ignorant and perplexed man who never
wakesfromhisstupor.Infact,thecaseagainsthimisstronger,hisanguishmore
binding, and his culpability greater before God. 1.108 From an oration
by ʿAlī:1 1.108.1 I warn you against this world, for it is sweet and
lush and surrounded by temptations. It breeds love for the here and now
and excites wonder with its trifles, it is adorned with false hopes and
embellished with deceptions, its joy does not last and its trauma is
relentless. A ghoulish devourer, it deceives, harms, changes, ceases,
wanes, perishes, and consumes. At the very moment that it fulfills your
dearest hopes, it becomes---as God Most High has said--- «like water
that we sent down from the sky: the earth's vegetation drew from it,
then became dry straw, and was scattered by the winds. God has power
over all things.»2 The world never gives a man joy without following it
with tears, it never bestows happiness without following it with harm,
it never sprinkles soft ease without following it with a cloudburst of
calamity. If it braces him in the morning it rejects him in the evening,
if one of its aspects is sweet and sugary the other is bitter and
pestilential, if it bestows fresh boun- ties it oppresses later with
oppressive misfortunes; a man does not pass the night sheltered under
its wing without waking up under its pinion of fear. The world deceives
and all in it is deception. The world will perish and all upon it will
perish. There is no good in any of its provisions save piety. Those who
take little from the world gather stores of protection, while those who
amass its wares hoard that which will destroy, whose benefit will soon
cease. 1 On the pulpit in Basra, immediately after the Battle of the
Camel in 36/356. Kulaynī, Kāfī, 8:256. 2 Qurʾan, Kahf 18:45. al-Sharīf

1: Orations 281 The world strikes those who trust it and fells those who
place in it their faith. How many grandees has it humbled! How many
arrogant men has it debased! Its power goes around in turns, its life is
turbid, its water is brackish, its sweets are filled with bitter juice,
its nourishment is poison, its ropes are decayed, its living are targets
for death, its healthy are targets for illness, its kingdom will be
pillaged, its mighty will be vanquished, its wealthy will be afflicted,
and its neighbors will be plundered. 1.108.2 Do you not dwell in the
abodes of those who came before you and enjoyed longer lives, who left
behind more lasting monuments, had lengthier aspirations, were more
profuse in number, and led vaster armies? They wor- shipped the world
abjectly, they gave it preference, fully and truly, but they left it
without sufficient provisions for the journey, or even a mount to carry
them on its back. Have you ever heard that the world in its generosity
let a single soul escape in lieu of ransom, or that it gave them any
form of help, or offered to accompany them? No. It crushed them with
catastrophes, weakened them with calamities, shook them with
misfortunes, ground their noses in the dust, trampled them under its
hooves, and equipped fate to bring them down. You have seen how it
rejected those who bowed before it, gave it preference, and offered it
loyalty. Their departure is an eternal separation. Did the world sup-
ply them with anything other than thirst, house them in anything other
than narrow graves, give them anything other than dark gloom, or requite
them with anything other than regret? Is this the same world that you
too favor above all else, put your faith in, covet?What a wretched abode
for those who do not view it with suspicion, who are not on their guard!
1.108.3 Know this---and you do---that you too will leave the world, you
too will depart. Take lessons from the fate of those who «said: is
anyone might- ier than we are?»1 They have been carried to their graves
but cannot be called wayfarers, they have been laid there to rest but
cannot be called guests, they have been covered in dirt and shrouded by
earth. Decaying bones are their neighbors---neighbors who cannot answer
those who call out to them, offer protection from attackers, or care
about their mourners' wails. If they get rain they do not rejoice, if
they encounter drought they do not despair. They are together yet each
is alone, neighbors yet so far distant from one another, so close yet
they do not visit, so near yet they cannot meet, senior commanders whose
hostilities are a thing of the past, rash youths whose hate and rancor 1

283 have been swept away, their blows no longer feared, their protection
no longer sought. They surrendered the back of the earth for its belly,
a vast space for narrow straits, family for exile, and light for
darkness. They left the world as they had come, barefoot and naked,
departing with their deeds to eternal life and the everlasting abode.
For, as God says, «as I brought the first creation into being, so I
shall bring it forth anew---this is my pledge, and I shall bring it to
pass.»1 1.109 From an oration by ʿAlī in which he spoke of the Angel of
Death and the manner in which he takes souls:2 Do you sense his presence
when he enters a home, or see him when he takes someone away? In fact,
do you know how he takes the life of a fetus from inside its mother's
womb? Does he enter through one of her limbs, or does its spirit answer
the angel with God's permission, or is he residing with it already
inside the mother? How can we who are incapable of describing a creature
like us aspire to describe our creator? 1.110 From an oration by ʿAlī: I
warn you of this world: it is a home from which you will be uprooted,
not an abode where you own the right to pasture, a dwelling adorned in
deception, deceiving with its adornments. It is worth nothing in the
eyes of its Lord, which is why he has intertwined the lawful in it with
the unlawful, the good with the bad, life with death, and sweet with
bitter. God has not made the world pure for his friends to enjoy, nor
begrudged it to his enemies, for its good is meager, its evil ever
present, its goods are temporary, its realm awaits pillage, and its
habi- tations anticipate ruin. What good is a house that will crumble as
a timeworn edifice, a life that will be exhausted like provisions, and a
timespan that will be completed like a journey? When you supplicate God,
include a prayer for his help in undertaking his mandates and ask him to
aid you in giving him his due. Bend your ears to death's summons before
your name is called. True renun- ciants live thus: their hearts weep
even when they laugh, their grief is intense even when they are joyful,
and their self-condemnation is great even though they are delighted with
what they have been given. But your hearts have lost awareness of your
imminent end and are filled with false hopes; the world con- trols you
to the detriment of the hereafter; the here-and-now has distanced you
fromtheafterlife.YouarebrethreninGod'sreligion,butfoulintentionsandevil

نحمده على آلائهكما نحمده على بلائه. ونستعينه على هذه النفوس البِطاء عمّا

1: Orations 285 purposes have divided you---you have stopped supporting
one another, coun-
selingoneanother,givingtooneanother,orbearingoneanotheraffection.Why are
you so overjoyed when you win the world's baubles, yet not grieved when
deprived of the hereafter's bounty? How are you so exasperated by the
loss of these trifles that your anger, your frustration, is plain on
your face? You act as
thoughyouwillalwayslivehere,asthoughthiswealthwillalwaysremainyours! The
only thing that stops you from confronting your brother or disclosing
his failings is your fear that he will do the same. You have both
rejected the after- life and devoted yourselves to the present. Religion
to you has become a dollop for your tongue to lick up, as though you had
already completed your work and satisfied your master. 1.111 From an
oration by ʿAlī:1 1.111.1 Praise God who has linked praise with favors
and favors with thanks. We praise him for his blessings, as we praise
him for his trials. We ask him to rally our hearts, which are slow to
undertake his command and quick to rush into what he has forbidden.We
ask his forgiveness for everything we have done that his knowledge
encompasses and his inventory includes---that knowledge never falls
short, and that inventory never omits. We believe in him, as though we
have already seen the deep mysteries and attained the promised reward---
our sincerity refuses to assign partners to him, and our certainty
rejects all doubt. We bear witness that there is no god but God, he has
no partner, and Muḥammad is his servant and messenger, a testimony that
assures our prayers' and our deeds' ascent to God---no scale on which it
is placed is light, no scale from which it is absent has weight. 1.111.2
Servants of God, I counsel you to be conscious of him, to be pious.
Piety is the best provision for the journey and the best means of
return, for it is the provision that will get you to your destination
and the return it promises is assured. A perfect caller has called
toward it and a perfect listener has taken it to heart---that caller was
effective, and that listener will win entry to paradise. Servants of
God, his consciousness has protected his chosen ones from trans- 1 Ṭūsī
(Amālī, 443) prefaces §1.111.2 by saying, "The Commander of the Faithful
would say," indi- cating that the theme and words were frequent in
ʿAlī's oration; Naḥḥās (ʿUmdah, 1:353) cites it in an oration attributed
to Zayd ibn ʿAlī. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -
