# Chapter 85: Sayings 753 Section on Rare Words A selection from ʿAlī's
sayings that need lexical explanations 3.245 When that happens,
religion's queen bee will rest its abdomen on the ground, and people
will gather around it like puffs of cloud gathering rapidly in autumn.1
Raḍī: "Religion's queen bee (yaʿsūb al-dīn)" denotes the great leader
who will rule peo- ple's affairs on that day. "Puffs (quzaʿ)" are wisps
of waterless clouds. 3.246 This swift-tongued orator.2 Raḍī: ʿAlī means
someone who is skilled and adept in oratory. A man who is adept in
speech or travel is called "swift (shaḥshaḥ)." Shaḥshaḥin other contexts
can also mean stingy and tight-fisted. 3.247 Quarrels are bucking steeds
that hurl their riders into perils.3 Raḍī: By "hurling into perils
(quḥam)," ʿAlī means into pits of death, because quarrels often fling
their riders into pits of death and perdition. The similar phrase, "the
peril into which the Bedouin are hurled (quḥmat al-aʿrāb)," denotes a
year when drought strikes the Bedouin and emaciates their herds; that is
what drought's bucking with them means. The latter phrase is
alternatively explained as the desert's hurling the Bedouin into
farmlands, meaning that it forces them to enter settled locales when
their nomadic pastures dry up. 3.248 When a girl enters the life-phase
of a three-year-old camel, her paternal relatives have greater right
over her guardianship.
Raḍī:Thephraseisalsonarratedasnaṣṣal-ḥiqāq,insteadof naṣṣal-ḥaqāʾiq.
Naṣṣmeans the limit of things and their ultimate reach, like the limit
in traveling, because that is the farthest a camel can go. You say "I
pressed the man to the limit about that matter" 1 Explained as a
prophecy about the Messiah (Mahdī) coming at the end of time. "Resting
its abdomen on the ground" refers to the establishment of his rule. R

755 if you pushed him on a question to extract all the information that
he had about it. Naṣṣal-ḥiqāq means reaching physical maturity, because
that is the limit of childhood, the point at which a child becomes an
adult. This is among the most eloquent and marvelous of expressions that
connote this transformation. ʿAlī is saying: When a girl reaches that
stage, her paternal relatives---close blood relatives such as brothers
and uncles---have a greater right to her than her mother does, and they
have a right to con- tract the girl's marriage if they choose to do so.
Ḥiqāq is the dispute (muḥāqqah) in which the mother engages against the
girl's paternal relatives, i.e., the clash and the quarrel, each of the
two parties saying to the other, "I have more right (anā aḥaqq) in this
matter than you." From this comes the phrase, "I contested with him for
a right (ḥāqaqtuhu ḥiqāqan)," which is similar to, "I disputed with him
( jādaltuhu jidālan)." It is also said that naṣṣal-ḥiqāq refers to the
development of the mind, and that is what is meant by maturity, because
ʿAlī meant the final stage of mental development, after which an
individual can be trusted to look after her own rights and obligations.
As for those who narrate the phrase with the variant naṣṣal-ḥaqāʾiq,
they take ḥaqāʾiq to be the plural of ḥaqīqah (a reality).The above
paragraph constitutes Abū ʿUbayd al-Qāsim ibn Sallām's explanation of
the phrase.1 In my view, what is meant here by the phrase naṣṣal-ḥiqāq
is a woman's reaching the stage at which she can be married and when she
can be allowed to administer her own rights. ʿAlī compares young women
at that stage to ḥiqāq, the plural of ḥiqqah and of ḥiqq, namely, a
camel that has ended three years and begun its fourth. At this age, its
back is strong enough to ride, and it can be pushed hard on a journey.
The word in the variant narration, ḥaqāʾiq, is also a plural of ḥiqqah,
and thus, both variants in the narration have the same meaning. This
explana- tionconformsbetterwiththewaysof
theArabsthanthefirstonegivenbyAbūʿUbayd.2 3.249 Faith begins as a
shining spot in the heart. As faith increases, the light expands. Raḍī:
"A shining spot (lumẓah)" is a fleck of white or something like a fleck.
From this comes the phrase "a horse with a shining spot ( farasun
almaẓ)," when it has a fleck of white on its lip. 1 Abū ʿUbayd, Gharīb
al-ḥadīth, s.v. "Ḥ-Q-Q." 2 Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd (Ḥ19:109--110) also finds
problems with Abū ʿUbayd's grammatical and lex- ical parsing. He prefers
Raḍī's explanations overall, but corrects the last part, saying that the
Arabic word ḥaqāʾiq is the "plural of the plural" ( jamʿ al-jamʿ) of
ḥiqqah, the plural being ḥiqāq. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and

757 3.250 If a man recovers a dubious debt, he should pay any past
levies due on it. Raḍī: A "dubious (ẓanūn)" debt is one whose owner is
not sure whether he will recover it from the borrower or not. He
vacillates, at one point hopeful, and at another losing heart. This is
among the most eloquent of expressions. Similarly, everything you seek
but do not know where you stand regarding it is "dubious." Aʿshā's
verses are relevant to this explanation:1 The dubious well That the
thunder clouds pass by Is not the surging Euphrates Which tosses ship
and captain. "Well ( judd)" means a borehole, and "dubious (ẓanūn)"
describes a well which one cannot be certain contains water. 3.251 As
ʿAlī bade farewell to a military contingent he was sending on a raid, he
said to them: Abstain as much as possible from the sweetness of women.
Raḍī: This means desist from brooding over your women and occupying your
hearts with thoughts about them; do not have intimacy with them either.
These things damp- en zeal, undo the knots of resolve, delay expeditious
travel, and distract from com- mitted fighting. A person who refrains
from something has "desisted from it (aʿdhaba ʿanhu)."2 "A person who
desists (ʿādhib or ʿadhūb)" is one who refrains from eating and
drinking. 3.252 Like the successful gambler who awaits his first winning
arrow.3 1 Aʿshā, Dīwān, 141, verses 19--20. 2 Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd (Ḥ19:114)
agrees with Raḍī's explanation overall, but he says the verb in this
explanatory phrase should be in Form i (ʿadhaba), not Form iv (aʿdhaba).

759 Raḍī: "Gamblers (yāsirūn)" are those who draw arrows to divide a
slaughtered camel's meat. A "successful ( fālij)" person is one who
conquers and is victorious. It is said, "He was victorious over them (
falaja ʿalayhim)" or "He successfully overpowered them ( falajahum)." A
rajaz-poet has said, ⟨When I saw a successful man who was victorious (
fālijan qad falajā).⟩1 3.253 When the fighting raged red-hot, we would
seek help from the Messen- ger, and when that happened, no one engaged
the enemy more closely than he did. Raḍī:This means that when fear of
the enemy was greatest and the battle sank its teeth into us, the
Muslims beseeched help from God's Messenger, who then entered the fray
in person. When that happened, God sent them victory and they were
secured against what they had feared, because of the Messenger's
closeness to God. ʿAlī's words, "When the fighting raged red-hot (idhā
ḥmarra l-baʾs)," connotes the severity of the battle. Many explanations
have been given for this metaphor, and the best of them holds that ʿAlī
compared the heat of battle to fire because it combines burning and
redness, thus, action and color.This explanation is supported by some
words the Prophet spoke when he observed the impassioned fighting
against the Hawāzin in the Battle of Ḥunayn: ⟨Now the furnace burns
(al-āna ḥamiya l-waṭīs)!⟩2 A furnace is the place where fire is stoked,
and the Prophet compared the heat of the fighting to the flames of a
fire and its intense blaze. The section on rare words ends here. We
return now to the chapter's original thread. 1 Rajaz is a poetic meter
used, in pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, for spontaneous verse
recited in battle or otherwise, in the form mustafʿilun mustafʿilun
mustafʿilun. The line is grammatically incomplete, and the second
hemistich is not recorded in the commentaries. I have not been able to
identify the poet: the line is not in the published Dīwāns of the famous
Umayyad rajaz poets ʿAjjāj (d. ca. 90/715) or his son Ruʾbah
(d. 145/762). 2 Hadith cited by Suyūṭī, Jāmiʿ, §3012. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

761 3.254 When news reached ʿAlī that Muʿāwiyah's militia had raided
Anbar, he stormed from the town and walked all the way to Nukhaylah.
People caught up with him there and entreated him, "Stay back, Commander
of the Faithful, let us take care of them for you!" He exclaimed:1 By
God, you are not even able to protect me against yourselves, how will
you protect me against others? In the past, people used to complain of
the injustice of their rulers. I complain of the injustice wrought by my
subjects! I seem to be the one being led, they the leaders. I seem to be
the one under command, they the commanders. Raḍī: When ʿAlī spoke these
lines---followed by a long oration (of which a selection is included in
our chapter on orations)2---two men from among his supporters stepped
forward, and one of them declared, "«I have jurisdiction only over
myself and my brother»3 so give us your command, Commander of the
Faithful, and we shall execute it forthwith." ʿAlī replied, "What can
the two of you accomplish? You are far short of what I need!" 3.255 It
is narrated that al-Ḥārith ibn Ḥawṭcame to ʿAlī and challenged him, "Are
you asking me to believe that the people who fought you at the Battle of
the Camel were misguided?" ʿAlī replied:4 1 In 39/660, led by Sufyān ibn
ʿAwf al-Ghāmidī, in which he killed ʿAlī's governor, Ḥassān al- Bakrī.
After the event described in our text, ʿAlī set up camp at Nukhaylah,
preparing to march against Muʿāwiyah, but when evening came, most people
returned to Kufa and ʿAlī was left with only his family and a handful of
his staunch supporters, and he was forced to return to Kufa (F 443).
ʿAlī's oration at Nukhaylah is recorded in §1.27. 2 §1.27, §1.94.1. 3
Qurʾan, Māʾidah 5:25. 4 Ḥārith ibn Ḥawṭchallenged ʿAlī thus while
orating on the pulpit, presumably in Kufa, before marching to Ṣiffīn in
36/356. Jāḥiẓ, Bayān, 3:211. There are various speculations about
Ḥārith's father's name, which indicate that Ḥārith was not well known.
Most likely the name is "Ḥawṭ," following mss Sh and N, and the
commentaries R 3:374, and Ḥ19:147, 148, as well as Jāḥiẓ, Bayān, 3:211,
who adds "al-Laythī." R 3:368 and Ḥ19:148 also record the variant
"Khūṭ," and state that Raḍī wrote the name thus in his own hand, "with
the letter 'Kh', dotted, and vocal- izedas 'ū'
(khāʾmuʿjamahmaḍmūmah)."msYsaysthesame,but adds thatthe correctspelling
according to the hadith scholars, however, is "Ḥawṭ." Other variants of
the name are "Ḥawt" and "Ḥūt" (B 993). al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015)
