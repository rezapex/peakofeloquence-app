# Chapter 38: Orations 405
Eyesdonotseehimthroughphysicalobservation,butheartsperceivehimwith true
belief. He is near to all things without touching them, yet far from
them without being apart. He speaks without the need to reflect, wills
without the need to aspire, and crafts without the need for hands. He is
sublime but can- not be described as concealed. He is mighty but cannot
be described as harsh. He is all-seeing but cannot be described as
having eyes. He is merciful but can- not be described as having
compassion. All faces bow to his majesty. All hearts tremble in awe.
1.178 From an address by ʿAlī censuring his associates:1 I offer praise
to God for the affairs he has ordained and the events he has des- tined,
and even for afflicting me with you, the faction who don't obey when I
command, or answer when I call! In times of peace, you speak boldly, but
when attacked, you bleat like lambs.2 When people unite behind a leader,
you chal- lenge him, and if you answer a call to fight, you soon
retreat. May you not be deprived of fathers!What are you waiting for?Why
do you sit back, why do you not fight for your rights?This way, you will
only find death or dishonor! By God, when my day comes---and it is
coming---and when it takes me from you, I will leave you as one who
detests your company, and who, when he has you on his side, has nothing.
My God, what manner of men are you! Does no religion unite you, no
zealous honor sharpen your resolve? Is it not astonishing that when
Muʿāwiyah calls to his uncouth riffraff they follow him, even without
wages or stipend, and when I call out to you---you, who are the legacy
of Islam and sons of the first Muslims,3 and even though I promise you
wages and stipend---you dissent, you oppose my command! Everything I
propose, you reject, and every- thing I reject, you band together to
promote. O how I long to meet death! I instructed you in the Book and
showed you its proofs, I dispelled your igno- rance and taught you to
swallow the dribble from your flaccid mouths---but the blind can't see,
and the sleeping don't wake! O how close to unbelief is that faction
whose caravan is led by Muʿāwiyah, and whose instructor in morals is the
Harlot's son!4 1 ʿAlī delivered this oration in Kufa in 38/658, urging
his followers to march in support of Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr, his governor
in Egypt, who had been besieged by Muʿāwiyah's com- mander ʿAmr ibn
al-ʿĀṣ. Ṭabarī, Tārīkh, 5:107. Thaqafī, Ghārāt, 1:291. 2 Ar. khurtum.
Or, "you show weakness." 3 "Legacy of Islam," lit. "broken ostrich
shells (tarīkah) of Islam." "Sons of the first Muslims," lit. "remainder
of the people." 4 Referring to ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ, whose mother was
infamous in the pre-Islamic period as "The Harlot" (nābighah, lit. "the
woman who shows herself"). Details in note at §1.81. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

407 1.179 From an address by ʿAlī. ʿAlī had sent one of his men to bring
news of a group from his Kufan army who were tempted to join the
Kharijites and were fearful of ʿAlī's retribution. When the man came
back, ʿAlī asked him: Did they feel secure enough to stay, or did they
become cowards and run? The man answered: They're gone, Commander of the
Faithful. ʿAlī then said:1 «Away with» them, «as theThamūd were done
away with!»2 If spears had been
hurledatthemandswordshadrainedontheirheads,theywouldhaveregretted what
they have done! Satan has found them small pickings today, and tomor-
row he will discard them and disown them completely. Enough that they
have left the home of guidance and lapsed into error and blindness.
Enough that they have challenged right and bolted into the waterless
wastes. 1.180 From an oration by ʿAlī. Nawf al-Bikālī reported: The
Commander of the Faith- ful addressed us in Kufa, standing on a rock
placed for him by Jaʿdah ibn Hubayrah al-Makhzūmī. He was wearing a
simple wool garment, his sword-belt was plaited from palm fronds, he
wore palm-frond sandals on his feet, and his forehead looked like the
calloused knee of a camel stallion. He orated:3 1.180.1
PraiseGod,towhomallcreationarrives,andallaffairsreturn!Wepraise him for
his great blessings, his lucent proof, and his abundant favor and
bounty. We praise him to repay his due, render him thanks, draw closer
to his reward, and deserve more of his beautiful favors. We ask his aid,
hoping for his favor, wishing for his profit, trusting in his
protection, acknowledging his gift, and submitting to him with deed and
word. We believe in him, placing our hopes in him with certainty,
turning to him as believers, bowing to him in submis- sion, proclaiming
his unity with sincerity, glorifying his greatness, and seeking his
protection through our hopes and efforts. 1 The group ʿAlī refers to in
this text are the Banū Nājiyah, a Christian tribe, who, under their
leader al-Khirrīt ibn Rāshid al-Nājī, deserted from ʿAlī's army after
the arbitration, in the early monthsof
38/658.ʿAlīsenthiscommanderMaʿqilibnQaysal-Riyāḥīwithtroopstofightthem,
and Khirrīt and many of his warriors were killed in the ensuing battle.
Details in Ḥ3:120--151 (text at 130). The rest were made captive, and
Maṣqalah ibn Hubayrah---ʿAlī's governor in Ardashīr---purchased them
from Maʿqil and freed them. Maṣqalah, after paying only a frac- tion of
the price, defected to Muʿāwiyah (see §1.44 and the accompanying note).

Possibly a Friday sermon, based on Nawf's mention of "the next Friday"
in §1.180.7. "His forehead looked like the calloused knee of a camel

1: Orations 409 1.180.2 Never begotten, he has no partner in might,
never begetting, he has no heir, for he will never die.1 Time and age
have not preceded him, increase and decrease have not affected him.
Rather, he appeared before our intel- lects through the signs he showed
us of his perfect planning and his irre- vocable decree. Among the
testaments of his creation is the creation of the skies, anchored
without columns and standing without supports. He called out to them,
and they answered, obedient and submissive, neither hesitant nor slow.
If not for their acknowledgment of his sovereignty and their sub-
mission to him in obedience, he would not have made them the home for
his throne, the habitation of his angels, or the place to which the pure
word and the pious deed ascends from his creation.2 He made its stars
waymarks through which those lost in the myriad valleys of the earth's
provinces are guided. The darkening of the dusky night does not veil
their glow, and the swathes of intense black do not block the gleam of
the moon from spreading in the skies. Glory to the one from whom nothing
is hidden! Not the black- ness of spreading obscurity or tranquil night
in the earth's low regions and its rust-colored mountain ranges, not the
crash of thunder in the sky's far hori- zons and the momentary
brilliance of lightning bolts in the clouds, not the falling of a leaf
that is then blown away by stormy winds and pouring skies! He knows
where each raindrop falls and pools, where each ant trails and drags its
food, what foodstuffs suffice the gnat, and what every female carries in
her belly. 1.180.3 Praise God, who existed before stool, or throne, or
sky, or earth, or jinn, or human. He cannot be grasped by the
imagination or measured by percep- tion. No suppliant distracts him from
responding, no gift diminishes his trea- sures. No eye can see him, no
"where" can limit him, he cannot be described as being one of a pair, he
need not toil to create, he cannot be grasped with the senses, he cannot
be compared to people. He spoke to Moses and showed him his majestic
signs without limbs, or implements, or speech, or mouth.3 If you are
sincere---O you who take on the burden of describing your Lord!---then
first describe the archangels Gabriel and Michael, or the legions of
cherubim in the vaults of the holy heavens, who bend low in humility,
whose intellects bewilderment hinders from constraining the best of
creators! Only entities with forms and appendages, entities that run
their course and perish when 1 Reference to Qurʾan, Ikhlāṣ112:3. 2

description of their attributes. Understand that there is no God but he.
Every darkness brightens with his light, every light darkens with his
darkness. 1.180.4 Servants of God, I counsel you to be conscious of God,
who clothed you in finery and gave you a life of plenty. If ever there
was one who could have found a ladder to eternity or a path to repel
death, it would have been Solomon, son of David, who was given dominion
over the kingdom of jinn and humans, along with prophecy and intimacy
with God. But when he had his received his fill of the world and
completed his time, annihilation felled him with the arrow of death.
Abodes became empty of him and habitations vacant. They were inherited
by others. Truly, you have been given lessons in the passage of
generations!WherearetheAmalekitesandthedescendantsof theAmalekites?
Where are the Pharaohs and the descendants of the Pharaohs? Where are
the people of the cities of Rass, who killed their prophets,
extinguished the prac- tice of God's emissaries, and revived the ways of
tyrants?1Where are those who marched at the head of armies, defeating
thousands, mobilizing troops, and building great cities? 1.180.5 From
the same oration: He will come bearing the shield of wisdom, having
seized it with all its re- quirements---attention, recognition, and
devotion. For him, wisdom is his own lost camel that he seeks, his own
missing saddlebags about which he inquires. Whenever Islam is exiled,
tail down like a camel and neck flat on the earth, he too hides in
exile. He is God's remaining proof, the successor of his prophets.
1.180.6 Then he said: People! I have given you the counsel with which
prophets guided their nations and conveyed to you what their legatees
conveyed to the subsequent gener- ation. I have disciplined you with my
whip, but you have not stayed upright. I have steered you with
admonitions, but your flock has not kept together. O God, what manner of
men are you? Are you waiting for another leader to walk you on the path
and guide you to the way? Listen to me! That portion of the world which
had approached has turned back, and that which had turned back now
approaches. God's pious servants have resolved to depart on their
journey. They have sold the paltry ephemera of the world for the
permanent abundance of the hereafter. Our brothers whose blood was spilt
in Ṣiffīn have lost noth- 1 The people of Rass are mentioned in Qurʾan,

413 ing by not being alive today. They no longer choke on morsels of
food or drink muddy water. By God, they have returned to him, and he has
given them their full reward, housing them in a place of safety after
their earlier trepidations! O where are my brothers who rode on the high
road and trod the track of right? Where is ʿAmmār, where is Ibn
al-Tayyihān, where is Dhū al-Shahādatayn?1 Where are their peers, their
brothers, who pledged to fight to the death, and whose decapitated heads
the dispatch carried to the depraved? Upon saying these words, ʿAlī
placed his hand on his beard and wept long and hard, then he continued:
Alas for my brothers who recited the Qurʾan and recited it well, who
reflected on their duty and undertook it!They revived the Sunnah and
killed heresy, they
werecalledtojihadandansweredthecall,theytrustedintheircommanderand
followed him. 1.180.7 Then ʿAlī called out in a raised voice: Servants
of God! Jihad, jihad! Harken to me! I will set up camp today! All who
wish to return to God should muster! Raḍī: Nawf said: In planning the
return to Ṣiffīn, ʿAlī appointed Ḥusayn commander over ten thousand
troops, Qays ibn Saʿd commander over ten thousand, Abū Ayyūb
al-Anṣārīcommanderovertenthousand,anddifferentcommandersovervaryingnum-
bers of troops. But no sooner had the next Friday come around than the
cursed Ibn Muljam struck him his deathblow, and the troops pulled back.
We were like sheep who had lost their shepherd, snatched by wolves from
every side. 1.181 From an oration by ʿAlī: 1.181.1 Praise be to God,
recognized without being seen, and creator without toil. He created all
things with his power, subjugated kings with his might, and dominated
grandees with his generosity. It was he who lodged his creatures in the
world, and he sent messengers to jinn and humans to lift her veils, warn
of her harm, explain her ciphers, and highlight her faults, to offer
lessons in her cycles of illness and health and her bounds of licit and
illicit, and to show them what God has prepared for those who obey or
disobey---paradise versus hell- 1 The three are the Prophet's venerable
Companions, ʿAmmār ibn Yāsir, Ibn al-Tayyihān al- Anṣārī, and Khuzaymah
ibn al-Thābit, Dhū al-Shahādatayn, "The-Twice-Martyred," who were killed
fighting for ʿAlī at the Battle of Ṣiffīn in 37/657. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

1: Orations 415 fire, honor versus shame. I offer him praise in the full
measure he deserves from his creatures. «God has appointed for each
thing a measure,» for each measure a timespan, and «for each timespan a
prescribed end.»1 1.181.2 From the same oration about the Qurʾan: The
Qurʾan commands and forbids, it is silent and yet it speaks, it is God's
proof against his creatures. He required them to offer the Qurʾan their
oaths and pledge their souls. He perfected its light, honored his
religion through it, and recalled his Prophet only after he had fully
conveyed the guidance of its rulings. Glorify God, then, in all the
glories that he has shown you, for he has not concealed from you any
part of his religion. He has left nothing that he likes or dislikes
without setting up a shining banner and a clear sign that either forbids
a thing or calls toward it. His likes for future generations are the
same, and his dislikes for them are also identical, so you should know
that he will not be pleased with something you do that displeased him
from the generations before you, while he will also not be displeased
with you for doing something
thatpleasedhimfromthem.Youfollowclearfootsteps,andyourspeechechoes the
words of men who walked before. In all this, God has provided you with
enough provisions for your life in this world---he has urged you to give
thanks and claimed tribute from your tongues. 1.181.3 God has counseled
you to piety and made it the ultimate way to earn his pleasure and
fulfil what he requires of his creatures. Be conscious of God, then, for
you are always before his eyes, your forelocks are in his hand, and your
fortunes are in his grip. If you hide something, he knows it, and if you
disclose something, he writes it down. He has appointed noble guardians
over you who
nevermisssomethingortranscribesomethinginerror.2Knowthat«Godshows the
God-conscious a way out»3 from seditions, and he grants them light after
darkness and eternal life with everything their hearts desire.4 He
houses the pious with honor near him, in the home he has prepared for
himself which is shaded by his throne, whose light is from his splendor,
whose visitors are his angels, and whose companions are his messengers.
Hasten to return to God, and race against your lifespans! The time is
near when your hopes will be cut off, death will overtake you, and the
door of repentance will be shut in your face. This morning, you are
still in the place to which your deceased ancestors 1 Qurʾan, Ṭalāq
