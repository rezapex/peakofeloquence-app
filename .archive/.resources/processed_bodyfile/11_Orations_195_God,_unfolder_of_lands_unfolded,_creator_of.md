# Chapter 11: Orations 195 God, unfolder of lands unfolded, creator of
skies elevated, infuser of hearts with their dispositions, blissful or
wretched---Shower your noblest blessings, your manifold graces, on
Muḥammad, your servant and messenger, the seal on what had come before,
opener of all things locked, announcer of the truth in truth, repeller
of the forces of evil, and crusher of the onslaught of error, doing all
this as he was charged to do. He undertook your command and rose to
serve your pleasure, with unfettered boldness and unfaltering resolve.
He comprehended your revelation, safeguarded your compact, and executed
your command, until he had ignited the flame of truth for those who
sought its fire, and illuminated the road for those who stumbled.
Through Muḥammad, hearts were guided after having been enmeshed in
mutiny. He erected clear waymarks and luminous rules. He is the trustee
whom you entrusted with your message, the custodian of your treasure of
knowledge, your witness on judg- ment day, your emissary dispatched with
the truth, and your messenger to the world. God, grant him a spacious
home in your shade and a good reward multiplied by your generosity. God,
let his palace soar above all others, give honor to his station at your
side, and perfect his light.1 Reward him for being an exemplary
messenger, one whose testimonial was accepted and whose words convinced,
who spoke justly and took decisive action. God, unite us with him in a
peaceful afterlife in a blessed abode, every desire satisfied, every
plea- sure granted, in ease, gentleness, and serenity, welcomed with
your gifts of honor. 1.70 From ʿAlī's address to Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam in
Basra. It is reported that when Marwān was taken prisoner at the Battle
of the Camel, he begged Ḥasan and Ḥusayn to intercede for his release
with the Commander of the Faithful. They spoke with their
father,whoansweredthathecouldgofree.Theythenadded,"Commanderof theFaith-
ful, he wishes to pledge allegiance to you," and he replied:2 1 Modified
quote from Qurʾan, Taḥrīm 66:8. 2 36/656. On Marwān and his dealings
with ʿAlī, see Ḥ6:148--165. See also §3.141. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

197 Did he not pledge allegiance to me right after ʿUthmān was killed? I
have no need of his pledge now. His is a Jewish hand!1 If he were to
pledge allegiance to me with his hand, he would break it the next moment
with wind from his arse.2 One day, he will rule, but his rule will only
last for as long as it takes a dog to lick its snout.3 He will also
father four rams.4 At his hand and theirs, Muslims will encounter bloody
death! 1.71 From ʿAlī's address to the Shūrā Council when they resolved
to pledge allegiance to ʿUthmān as the next caliph:5
YouknowfullwellthatIhavemorerighttothecaliphatethananyoneelse.Iwill
concede---but, by God, I will continue to do so only for as long as the
concerns of the Muslims remain unharmed, as long as the injustice is
directed solely at me. I do so in the hope of God's reward and
recompense and in distaste for the adornments and splendors for which
you vie. 1.72 From ʿAlī's address when he heard reports that the
Umayyads were accusing him of complicity in ʿUthmān's killing: 1 The
hand is singled out for mention because a handclasp in that society
sealed one's pledge of allegiance to a ruler. "A Jewish hand" presumably
refers to the pledge given to the Prophet and then broken by the Medinan
Jewish tribes. For a summary of Jews in the Qurʾan and early traditional
Muslim historical works, see Stillman, "Yahūd,"ei2. 2 Lit. "he would
deceive with his arse" (la-ghadara bi-sabbatihi). The commentators
generally read this phrase metaphorically to denote strong censure and
derision, but some also read it literally: Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd says it was
common practice among the Arabs for a man to break wind upon resolving
to break a pledge (!), and Rāwandī notes that "to insult" (sabbahū)
liter- ally means to pierce in the buttocks with a spear. Ḥ6:147; B 302;
R 1:302. 3 Marwān (r. 64--65/684--685) became caliph after the last
Sufyanid-Umayyad caliph, Muʿāwi-
yahii,andhisreignlastedbetweensixandtenmonths.Cf.Bosworth,"Marwānib.al-Ḥakam,"
ei2. 4 The "four rams" are said to be either (1) Marwān's sons: ʿAbd
al-Malik (caliph, r. 65--86/685-- 705), and ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz, Bishr, and
Muḥammad, who ruled respectively as governors of Egypt, Iraq, and the
Arabian Peninsula; or (2) Marwān's grandsons through ʿAbd al-Malik, the
only four brothers to rule as caliph: Walīd (r. 86--96/705--715),
Sulaymān (r. 96--99/715--717), Yazīd (r. 101--105/720--724), and Hishām
(r. 105--125/724--723). B 302; R 1:306--307; Ḥ6:147--148. 5 ʿAlī
delivered this address in Medina following ʿUmar's death in 23/644; I
have added the words "the Shūrā Council" for clarity. Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd
also notes ʿAlī's citation at this time of several well-known hadith,
including, ⟨For whomsoever I am master, ʿAlī is his master⟩, ⟨You are to
me as Aaron was to Moses⟩, ⟨You are my brother in this world and the
next⟩--- the Shiʿa consider these hadith proof of the Prophet's
appointment of ʿAlī as his successor. Ḥ 6:167--168. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī
