*Disclosing real facts about assassination of 'Uthman Ibn 'Affan*

Amir al-mu'minin said:

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> في معنى قتل عثمان

> \[و هو حكم له على عثمان و على الناس بما فعلوا و براءة له من دمه\]

If I had ordered his assassination I should have been his killer, but if
I had refrained others from killing him I would have been his helper.
The position was that he who helped him cannot now say that he is better
than the one who deserted him while he who deserted him cannot say that
he is better than the one who helped him. I am putting before you his
case. He appropriated (wealth) and did it badly. You protested against
it and committed excess therein. With Allah lies the real verdict
between the appropriator and the protester.

> لَوْ أَمَرْتُ بِهِ لَكُنْتُ قَاتِلاً، أَوْ نَهَيْتُ عَنْهُ لَكُنْتُ نَاصِراً، غَيْرَ أَنَّ مَنْ نَصَرَهُ لاَ
> يَسْتَطِيعُ أَنْ يَقُولَ: خَذَلَهُ مَنْ أَنَا خَيْرٌ مِنْهُ، وَمَنْ خَذَلَهُ لاَ يَسْتَطِيعُ أَنْ يَقُولَ: نَصَرَهُ
> مَنْ هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِنِّي. وَأَنَا جَامِعٌ لَكُمْ أَمْرَهُ، اسْتَأْثَرَ فَأَسَاءَ الاْثَرَةَ وَجَزِعْتُمْ فَأَسَأْتُمُ
> الجَزَعَ وَللهِ حُكْمٌ وَاقِعٌ في المُسْتَأْثِرِ وَالجَازعِ .

\(1\) Al-Baladhuri, *Ansab,* V, 98, 101.

-  \`Uthman is the
    first Umayyad Caliph of Islam who ascended the Caliphate on the 1st
    Muharram, 24 A.H. at the age of seventy and after having wielded
    full control and authority over the affairs of the Muslims for
    twelve years was killed at their hands on the 18th Dhi\'l-hijjah, 35
    A.H. and buried at Hashsh Kawkab.\
    This fact cannot be denied that \`Uthman\'s killing was the result
    of his weaknesses and the black deeds of his officers, otherwise,
    there is no reason that Muslims should have unanimously agreed on
    killing him while no one except a few persons of his house stood up
    to support and defend him. Muslims would have certainly given
    consideration to his age, seniority, prestige and distinction of
    companionship of the Prophet but his ways and deeds had so marred
    the atmosphere that no one seemed prepared to sympathise and side
    with him. The oppression and excesses perpetrated on high ranking
    companions of the Prophet had roused a wave of grief and anger among
    the Arab tribes. Everyone was infuriated and looked at his
    haughtiness and wrong doings with disdainful eyes. Thus, due to Abu
    Dharr\'s disgrace, dishonour and exile Banu Ghifar and their
    associate tribes, due to \`Abdullah ibn Mas\`ud\'s merciless beating
    Banu Hudhayl and their associates, due to breaking of the ribs of
    \`Ammar ibn Yasir, Banu Makhzum and their associates Banu Zuhrah,
    and due to the plot for the killing of Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, Banu
    Taym all had a storm of rage in their hearts. The Muslims of other
    cities were also brimful of complaints at the hands of his officers
    who under intoxication of wealth and the effects of luxury did
    whatever they wished and crushed whomever they wanted. They had
    neither fear of punishment from the centre nor apprehension of any
    enquiry. People were fluttering to get out of their talons of
    oppression but no one was ready to listen to their cries of pain and
    restlessness; feelings of hatred were rising but no care was taken
    to put them down. The companions of the Prophet were also sick of
    him as they saw that peace was destroyed, administration was
    topsy-turvy and Islam\'s features were being metamorphosed. The poor
    and the starving were craving for dried crusts while Banu Umayyah
    were rolling in wealth. The Caliphate had become a handle for
    belly-filling and a means of amassing wealth. Consequently, they too
    did not lag behind in preparing the ground for killing him. Rather,
    it was at their letters and messages that people from Kufah, Basrah
    and Egypt had collected in Medina. Observing this behaviour of the
    people of Medina, \`Uthman wrote to Mu\`awiyah: 'So now, certainly
    the people of Medina have turned heretics, have turned faith against
    obedience and broken the (oath of) allegiance. So you send to me the
    warriors of Syria on brisk and sturdy horses'.\
    The policy of action adopted by Mu\`awiyah on receipt of this letter
    also throws light on the condition of the companions. Historian
    at-Tabari writes after this: When the letter reached Mu\`awiyah he
    pondered over it and considered it bad to openly oppose the
    companions of the Prophet since he was aware of their unanimity.\
    In view of these circumstances to regard the killing of \`Uthman as
    a consequence of merely enthusiasm and temporary feelings and to
    hurl it at some insurgents is to veil the fact, since all the
    factors of his opposition existed within Medina itself, while those
    coming from without had collected for seeking redress of their
    grievances at their call. Their aim was only improvement of the
    position, not killing or bloodshed. If their complaints had been
    heard then the occasion for this bloodshed would not have arisen.\
    What happened was that when, having been disgusted with the
    oppression and excesses of \`Abdullah ibn Sa\`d ibn Abi Sarh, who
    was foster brother of \`Uthman, the people of Egypt proceeded
    towards Medina and camped in the valley of Dhakhushub near the city.
    They sent a man with a letter to \`Uthman and demanded that
    oppression should be stopped, the existing ways should be changed
    and repentance should be offered for the future. But instead of
    giving a reply \`Uthman got this man turned out of the house and did
    not regard their demands worth attention. On this these people
    entered the city to raise their voice against this pride and
    haughtiness, and complained to the people of this behaviour besides
    other excesses. On the other side many people from Kufah and Basrah
    had also arrived with their complaints and they, after joining these
    ones, proceeded forward with the backing of the people of Medina and
    confined \`Uthman within his house, although there was no
    restriction on his going and coming to the mosque. But in his sermon
    on the very first Friday he severely rebuked these people and even
    held them accursed, whereupon people got infuriated and threw
    pebbles at him as a result of which he lost control and fell from
    the pulpit. After a few days his coming and going to the mosque was
    also banned.\
    When \`Uthman saw matters deteriorating to this extent he implored
    Amir al-mu\'minin very submissively to find some way for his rescue
    and to disperse the people in whatever way he could. Amir
    al-mu\'minin said, \"On what terms can I ask them to leave when
    their demands are justified?\" \`Uthman said, \"I authorise you in
    this matter. Whatever terms you would settle with them I would be
    bound by them.\" So Amir al-mu\'minin went and met the Egyptians and
    talked to them. They consented to get back on the condition that all
    the tyrannies should be wiped off and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr be made
    governor by removing Ibn Abi Sarh. Amir al-mu\'minin came back and
    put their demand before \`Uthman who accepted it without any
    hesitation and said that to get over these excesses time was
    required. Amir al-mu\'minin pointed out that for matters concerning
    Medina delay had no sense. However, for other places so much time
    could be allowed that the Caliph\'s message could reach them.
    \`Uthman insisted that for Medina also three days were needed. After
    discussion with the Egyptians Amir al-mu\'minin agreed to it also
    and took all the responsibility thereof upon himself. Then they
    dispersed at his suggestion. Some of them went to Egypt with
    Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr while some went to the valley of Dhakhushub
    and stayed there and this whole matter ended. On the second day of
    this event Marwan ibn al-Hakam said to \`Uthman, \"It is good, these
    people have gone, but to stop people coming from other cities you
    should issue a statement so that they should not come this way and
    sit quiet at their places and that statement should be that some
    people collected in Medina on hearing some irresponsible talk but
    when they came to know that whatever they heard was wrong they were
    satisfied and have gone back.\" \`Uthman did not want to speak such
    a clear lie but Marwan convinced him and he agreed, and speaking in
    the Holy Prophet\'s mosque, he said:\
    These Egyptians had received some news about their Caliph and when
    satisfied that they were all baseless and wrong they went back to
    their cities.\
    No sooner he said this than there was great hue and cry in the
    mosque, and people began to shout to \`Uthman, \"Offer repentance,
    fear Allah; what is this lie you are uttering?\" \`Uthman was
    confused in this commotion and had to offer repentance.
    Consequently, he turned to the Ka\`bah, moaned in the audience of
    Allah and returned to his house.\
    Probably after this very event Amir al-mu\'minin advised \`Uthman
    that, \"You should openly offer repentance about your past misdeeds
    so that these uprisings should subside for good otherwise if
    tomorrow people of some other place come you will again cling to my
    neck to rid you of them.\" Consequently, he delivered a speech in
    the Prophet\'s mosque wherein admitting his mistakes he offered
    repentance and swore to remain careful in future. He told the people
    that when he alighted from the pulpit their representatives should
    meet him, and he would remove their grievances and meet their
    demands. On this people acclaimed this action of his and washed away
    their ill-feelings with tears to a great extent. When he reached his
    house after finishing from here Marwan sought permission to say
    something but \`Uthman\'s wife Na\'ilah bint Farafisah intervened.
    Turning to Marwan she said, \"For Allah\'s sake you keep quiet. You
    would say only such a thing as would bring but death to him.\"
    Marwan took it ill and retorted, \"You have no right to interfere in
    these matters. You are the daughter of that very person who did not
    know till his death how to perform ablution.\" Na\'ilah replied with
    fury, \"You are wrong, and are laying a false blame. Before uttering
    anything about my father you should have cast a glance on the
    features of your father. But for the consideration of that old man I
    would have spoken things at which people would have shuddered but
    would have confirmed every such word.\" When \`Uthman saw the
    conversation getting prolonged he stopped them and asked Marwan to
    tell him what he wished.\
    Marwan said, \"What is it you have said in the mosque, and what
    repentance you have offered? In my view sticking to the sin was a
    thousand times better than this repentance because however much the
    sins may multiply there is always scope for repentance, but
    repentance by force is no repentance. You have said what you have
    but now see the consequences of this open announcement, that crowds
    of people are at your door. Now go forward and fulfil their
    demands.\" \`Uthman then said, \"Well, I have said what I have said,
    now you deal with these people. It is not in my power to deal with
    them.\" Consequently, finding out his implied consent Marwan came
    out and addressing the people spoke out, \"Why have you assembled
    here? Do you intend to attack or to ransack? Remember, you cannot
    easily snatch away power from our hands, take out the idea from your
    hearts that you would subdue us. We are not to be subdued by anyone.
    Take away your black faces from here. Allah may disgrace and
    dishonour you.\"\
    When people noticed this changed countenance and altered picture
    they rose from there full of anger and rage and went straight to
    Amir al-mu\'minin and related to him the whole story. On hearing it
    Amir al-mu\'minin was infuriated and immediately went to \`Uthman
    and said to him, \"Good Heavens. How badly you have behaved with the
    Muslims. You have forsaken faith for the sake of a faithless and
    characterless man and have lost all wit. At least you should have
    regard and consideration for your own promise. What is this that at
    Marwan\'s betokening you have set off with folded eyes. Remember he
    will throw you in such a dark well that you will never be able to
    come out of it. You have become the carrier animal of Marwan so that
    he can ride on you howsoever he desires and put you on whatever
    wrong way he wishes. In future I shall never intervene in your
    affair nor tell people anything. Now you should manage your own
    affairs.\"\
    Saying all this Amir al-mu\'minin got back and Na\'ilah got the
    chance, she said to \`Uthman, \"Did I not tell you to get rid of
    Marwan otherwise he would put such a stain on you that it would not
    be removed despite all effort. Well, what is the good in following
    the words of one who is without any respect among the people and low
    before their eyes. Make \`Ali agree otherwise remember that
    restoring the disturbed state of affairs is neither within your
    power nor in that of Marwan.\" \`Uthman was impressed by this and
    sent a man after Amir al-mu\'minin but he refused to meet him. There
    was no siege around \`Uthman but shame deterred him. With what face
    could he come out of the house? But there was no way without coming
    out. Consequently, he came out quietly in the gloom of night and
    reaching Amir al-mu\'minin\'s place, he moaned his helplessness and
    loneliness, offered excuses, and also assured him of keeping
    promises but Amir al-mu\'minin said, \"You make a promise in the
    Prophet\'s mosque standing before all the people but it is fulfilled
    in this way that when people go to you they are rebuked and even
    abuses are hurled at them. When this is the state of your
    undertakings which the world has seen, then how and on what ground
    can I trust any word of yours in future. Do not have any expectation
    from me now. I am not prepared to accept any responsibility on your
    behalf. The tracks are open before you. Adopt whichever way you like
    and tread whatever track you choose.\" After this talk \`Uthman came
    back and began blaming Amir al-mu\'minin in retort to the effect
    that all the disturbances were rising at his instance and that he
    was not doing anything despite being able to do everything.\
    On this side the result of repentance was as it was. Now let us see
    the other side. When after crossing the border of Hijaz, Muhammad
    ibn Abi Bakr reached the place Aylah on the coast of the Red Sea
    people caught sight of a camel rider who was making his camel run so
    fast as though the enemy was chasing him. These people had some
    misgivings about him and therefore called him and enquired who he
    was. He said he was the slave of \`Uthman. They enquired wherefore
    he was bound. He said Egypt. They enquired to whom he was going. He
    replied to the Governor of Egypt. People said that the Governor of
    Egypt was with them. To whom was he going then? He said he was to go
    to Ibn Abi Sarh. People asked him if any letter was with him. He
    denied. They asked for what purpose he was going. He said he did not
    know that. One of these people thought that his clothes should be
    searched. So the search was made, but nothing was found on him.
    Kinanah ibn Bishr at-Tujibi said, \"See his water-skin.\" People
    said, \"Leave him, how can there be a letter in water! Kinanah said,
    \"You do not know what cunning these people play. \" Consequently,
    the water-skin was opened and seen. There was a lead pipe in it
    wherein was a letter. When it was opened and read, the Caliph\'s
    order in it was that \"When Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr and his party
    reaches you then from among them kill so and so, arrest so and so,
    and put so and so in jail, but you remain on your post.\" On reading
    this all were stunned and thus began to look at one another in
    astonishment.\
    A Persian hemistich says: Mind was just burst in astonishment as to
    what wonder it was!\
    Now proceeding forward was riding into the mouth of death,
    consequently they returned to Medina taking the slave with them.
    Reaching there they placed that letter before all the companions of
    the Prophet. Whoever heard this incident remained stunned with
    astonishment, and there was no one who was not abusing \`Uthman.
    Afterwards a few companions went to \`Uthman along with these
    people, and asked whose seal was there on this letter. He replied
    that it was his own. They enquired whose writing it was. He said it
    was his secretary\'s. They enquired whose slave was that man. He
    replied that it was his. They enquired whose riding beast it was. He
    replied that it was that of the Government. They enquired who had
    sent it. He said he had no knowledge of it. People then said, \"Good
    Heavens. Everything is yours but you do not know who had sent it. If
    you are so helpless, you leave this Caliphate and get off from it so
    that such a man comes who can administer the affairs of the
    Muslims.\" He replied, \"It is not possible that I should put off
    the dress of Caliphate which Allah has put on me. Of course, I would
    offer repentance.\" The people said, \"Why should you speak of
    repentance which has already been flouted on the day when Marwan was
    representing you on your door, and whatever was wanting has been
    made up by this letter. Now we are not going to be duped into these
    bluffs. Leave the Caliphate and if our brethren stand in our way we
    will hold them up; but if they prepare for fighting we too will
    fight. Neither our hands are stiff nor our swords blunt. If you
    regard all Muslims equally and uphold justice hand over Marwan to us
    to enable us to enquire from him on whose strength and support he
    wanted to play with the precious lives of Muslims by writing this
    letter.\" But he rejected this demand and refused to hand over
    Marwan to them, whereupon people said that the letter had been
    written at his behest.\
    However, improving conditions again deteriorated and they ought to
    have deteriorated because despite lapse of the required time
    everything was just as it had been and not a jot of difference had
    occurred. Consequently, the people who had stayed behind in the
    valley of Dhakhushub to watch the result of repentance again
    advanced like a flood and spread over the streets of Medina, and
    closing the borders from every side surrounded his house.\
    During these days of siege a companion of the Prophet, Niyar ibn
    \`Iyad desired to talk to \`Uthman, went to his house and called
    him. When he peeped out from the above he said, \"O\' \`Uthman, for
    Allah\'s sake give up this Caliphate and save Muslims from this
    bloodshed.\" While he was just conversing, one of \`Uthman\'s men
    aimed at him with an arrow and killed him, whereupon people were
    infuriated and shouted that Niyar\'s killer should be handed over to
    them. \`Uthman said it was not possible that he would hand over his
    own support to them. This stubbornness worked like a fan on fire and
    in the height of fury people set fire to his door and began
    advancing for entering, when Marwan ibn al-Hakam, Sa\`id ibn al-\`As
    and Mughirah ibn al-Akhnas together with their contingents pounced
    upon the besiegers and killing and bloodshed started at his door.
    People wanted to enter the house but they were being pushed back. In
    the meanwhile, \`Amr ibn Hazm al-Ansari whose house was adjacent to
    that of \`Uthman opened his door and shouted for advancing from that
    side. Thus through this house the besiegers climbed on the roof of
    \`Uthman\'s house and descending down from there drew their swords.
    Only a few scuffles had taken place when all except people of
    \`Uthman\'s house, his well-wishers and Banu Umayyah ran away in the
    streets of Medina and a few hid themselves in the house of Umm
    Habibah bint Abi Sufyan (Mu\`awiyah\'s sister) the rest were killed
    with \`Uthman defending him to the last. (at-Tabaqat, Ibn Sa\`d,
    vol. 3, Part 1, pp. 50-58; at-Tabari, vol. 1, pp. 2998-3025;
    al-Kamil, Ibn al-Athir, vol. 3, pp. 167-180; Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid, vol.
    2, pp. 144-161).\
    At his killing several poets wrote elegies. A couplet from the elegy
    by Abu Hurayrah is presented: Today people have only one grief but I
    have two griefs - the loss of my money bag and the killing of
    \`Uthman.\
    After observing these events the stand of Amir al-mu\'minin becomes
    clear, namely that he was neither supporting the group that was
    instigating at \`Uthman\'s killing nor can be included in those who
    stood for his support and defence but when he saw that what was said
    was not acted upon he kept himself aloof.\
    When both the parties are looked at then among the people who had
    raised their hands off from \`Uthman\'s support are seen \`A\'ishah,
    and according to the popular versions (which is not right) the then
    living persons out of the ten Pre-informed ones (who had been
    pre-informed in this world by the Prophet for their being admitted
    in Paradise), out of those who took part in the consultative
    committee (formed for \`Uthman\'s selection for Caliphate), ansar,
    original muhajirun, people who took part in the battle of Badr and
    other conspicuous and dignified individuals, while on the side (of
    Uthman) are seen only a few slaves of the Caliph and a few
    individuals from Banu Umayyah. If people like Marwan and Sa\`id ibn
    al-\`As cannot be given precedence over the original muhajirun their
    actions too cannot be given precedence over the actions of the
    latter. Again, if ijma\` (consensus of opinion) is not meant for
    particular occasions only then it would be difficult to question
    this overwhelming unanimity of the
    companions.]
