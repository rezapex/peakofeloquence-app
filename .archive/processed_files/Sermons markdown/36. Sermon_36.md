*Warning the people of Nahrawan*

*of their fate*

> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام)

> في تخويف أَهل النهروان

I am warning you that you will be killed on the bend of this canal and
on the level of this low area while you will have no clear excuse before
Allah nor any open authority with you. You have come out of your houses
and then divine decree entangled you.

I had advised you against this arbitration but you rejected my advice
like adversaries and opponents till I turned my ideas in the direction
of your wishes. You are a group whose heads are devoid of wit and
intelligence. May you have no father! (Allah's woe be to you!) I have
not put you in any calamity nor wished you harm.

> فَأَنَا نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ أَنْ تُصْبِحُوا صَرْعَى بِأَثْنَاءِ هذَا النَّهَرِ، وَبِأَهْضَامِ هذَاالْغَائِطِ عَلَى
> غَيْرِ بَيِّنَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ، وَلاَ سُلْطَانٍ مُبِينٍ مَعَكُمْ، قَدْ طَوَّحَتْ بِكُمُ الدَّارُ، وَاحْتَبَلَكُمُ
> الْمِقْدَارُ وَقَدْ كُنْتُ نَهَيْتُكُمْ عَنْ هذِهِ الْحُكُومَةِ فَأَبَيْتُمْ عَلَيَّ إِبَاءَ المخالفين، حَتَّى
> صَرَفْتُ رَأْيِي إِلَىْ هَوَاكُمْ، وَأَنْتُمْ مَعَاشِرُ أَخِفَّاءُ الْهَامِّ، سُفَهَاءُ الاْحْلاَمِ وَلَمْ آتِ ـ
> لاَ أَبَا لَكُمْ ـ بُجْراً وَلاَ أَرَدْتُ لَكُمْ ضُرّاً.

-  The cause of the
    battle of Nahrawan was that when after Arbitration Amir al-mu\'minin
    was returning to Kufah, the people who were foremost in pleading
    acceptance of Arbitration began to say that appointment of anyone
    other than Allah as arbitrator is heresy, and that, Allah forbid, by
    accepting the Arbitration Amir al-mu\'minin turned heretic.
    Consequently, by distorting the meaning of \"There is no authority
    same with Allah\" they made simple Muslims share their views and
    separating from Amir al-mu\'minin encamped at Hanira\' near Kufah.
    When Amir al-mu\'minin learned of these plottings he sent Sa\`sa\`ah
    ibn Suhan al-\`Abdi and Ziyad ibn an-Nadr al-Harithi in the company
    of Ibn \`Abbas towards them and afterwards himself went to the place
    of their stay and dispersed them after discussion.\
    When these people reached Kufah they began to spread the news that
    Amir al-mu\'minin had broken the agreement of Arbitration and that
    he is again ready to fight against the Syrians. When Amir
    al-mu\'minin learned this he contradicted it whereupon these people
    stood up in rebellion and encamped twelve miles from Baghdad in the
    low area of the canal called Nahrawan.\
    On the other side, after hearing the verdict of Arbitration Amir
    al-mu\'minin rose for fighting the army of Syria and wrote to the
    Kharijites that the verdict passed by the two arbitrators in
    pursuance of their heart\'s wishes instead of the Qur\'an and sunnah
    was not acceptable to him, that he had therefore decided to fight
    with them and they should support him for crushing the enemy. But
    the Kharijites gave him this reply, \"When you had agreed to
    Arbitration in our view you had turned heretic. Now if you admit
    your heresy and offer repentance we will think over this matter and
    decide what we should do.\" Amir al-mu\'minin understood from their
    reply that their disobedience and misguidance had become very
    serious. To entertain any kind of hope from them now was futile.
    Consequently, ignoring them he encamped in the valley of
    an-Nukhaylah with a view to marching towards Syria. When the army
    had been arrayed he came to know that the men desired to deal with
    the people of Nahrawan first, and to move towards Syria afterwards.
    Amir al-mu\'minin, however, said that they should be left as they
    were, that they themselves should first move towards Syria while the
    people of Nahrawan could be dealt with afterwards. People said that
    they were prepared to obey every order of his with all their might
    whether he moved this way or that way. The army had not moved when
    news about the rebellion of Kharijites began to reach, and it was
    learnt that they had butchered the governor of Nahrawan namely
    \`Abdullah ibn Khabbab ibn al-Aratt and his slave maid with the
    child in her womb, and have killed three women of Banu Tayyi and Umm
    Sinan as-Saydawiyyah. Amir al-mu\'minin sent al-Harith ibn Murrah
    al-\`Abdi for investigation but he too was killed by them. When
    their rebellion reached this stage it was necessary to deal with
    them. Consequently, the army turned towards Nahrawan. On reaching
    there Amir al-mu\'minin sent them word that those who had killed
    \`Abdullah ibn Khabbab ibn al-Aratt and innocent women should be
    handed over to him for avenging blood. Those people replied that
    they had killed these persons jointly and that they considered it
    lawful to shed the blood of all the people on his side. Even at this
    Amir al-mu\'minin did not take the initiative for the battle, but
    sent Abu Ayyub al-Ansari with a message of peace. So he spoke to
    them aloud, \"Whoever comes under this banner or separates from that
    party and goes to Kufah or al-Mada\'in would get amnesty and he
    would not be questioned. As a result of this Farwah ibn Nawfal
    al-Ashja\'i said that he did not know why they were at war with Amir
    al-mu\'minin. Saying this he separated along with five hundred men.
    Similarly group after group began to separate and some of them
    joined Amir al-mu\'minin. Those who remained numbered four thousand,
    and according to at-Tabari\'s account they numbered two thousand
    eight hundred. These people were not in any way prepared to listen
    to the voice of truth, and were ready to kill or be killed. Amir
    al-mu\'minin had stopped his men to take the initiative but the
    Kharijites put arrows in their bows and broke and threw away the
    sheathes of their swords. Even at this juncture Amir al-mu\'minin
    warned them of the dire consequences of war and this sermon is about
    that warning and admonition. But they were so brimming with
    enthusiasm that they leapt on Amir al-mu\'minin\'s force all of a
    sudden. This onslaught was so severe that the foot men lost ground
    but they soon fixed themselves firmly that the attack of arrows and
    spears could not dislodge them from their position and they soon so
    cleared away the Kharijites that except for nine persons who fled
    away to save their lives not a single person was left alive. From
    Amir al-mu\'minin\'s army only eight persons fell as martyrs. The
    battle took place on the 9th Safar, 38
    A.H.]
