*About 'Amr ibn al-'As*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> في ذكر عمرو بن العاص

I am surprised at the son of an-Nabighah that he says about me among the
people of Syria (ash-Sham) that I am a jester and that I am engaged in
frolics and fun. He said wrong and spoke sinfully. Beware, the worst
speech is what is untrue. He speaks and lies. He promises and breaks the
promise. He begs and beseeches, but when someone begs from him he
withholds miserly. He betrays the pledge and ignores kinship.

> عَجَباً لاِبْنِ النَّابِغَةِ! يَزْعُمُ لاِهْلِ الشَّامِ أَنَّ فِيَّ دُعَابَةً، وَأَنِّي امْرُؤٌ تِلْعَابَةٌ:
> أُعَافِسُ وَأُمَارِسُ ! لَقَدْ قَالَ بَاطِلاً، وَنَطَقَ آثِماً. أَمَا ـ وَشَرُّ الْقَوْلِ الْكَذِبُ ـ إِنَّهُ
> لَيَقُولُ فَيَكْذِبُ، وَيَعِدُ فَيُخْلِفُ، وَيُسْأَلُ فَيَبْخَلُ، وَيَسْأَلُ فَيُلْحِفُ، وَيَخُونُ الْعَهْدَ، وَيَقْطَعُ
> الْاِلَّ

When in a battle, he commands and admonishes but only until the swords
do not come into action. When such a moment arrives his great trick is
to turn naked{#epub.html_fref_1b09eb50_1
.see-footnote} before his adversary. By Allah, surely the remembrance of
death has kept me away from fun and play while obliviousness about the
next world has prevented him from speaking truth. He has not sworn
allegiance to Mu'awiyah without purpose; but has beforehand got him to
agree that he will have to pay its price, and gave him an award for
forsaking religion.

> فَإِذَا كَانَ عِنْدَ الْحَرْبِ فَأَيُّ زَاجِر وَآمِر هُوَ مَا لَمْ تَأْخُذِ السُّيُوفُ مَآخِذَهَا! فَإِذَا كَانَ
> ذلِكَ كَانَ أَكْبَرُ مَكيدَتِهِ أَنْ يَمْنَحَ الْقَوْمَ سُبَّتَهُ. أَمَا واللهِ إِنِّي لَـيَمْنَعُنِي مِنَ
> اللَّعِبِ ذِكْرُ الْموْتِ، وَإِنَّهُ لَيمَنَعُهُ مِنْ قَوْلِ الْحَقِّ نِسْيَانُ الاْخِرَةِ، إِنَّهُ لَمْ يُبَايعْ
> مُعَاوِيَةَ حَتَّى شَرَطَ لَهُ أَنْ يُؤْتِيَهُ أَتِيَّةً، وَيَرْضَخَ لَهُ عَلَى تَرْكِ الدِّينِ رَضِيخَةً.

-  Amir al-mu\'minin
    here refers to the incident when the \'Conqueror of Egypt\' \`Amr
    ibn al-\`As exhibited the feat of his courage by displaying his
    private parts. What happened was that when in the battlefield of
    Siffin he and Amir al-mu\'minin had an encounter, he rendered
    himself naked in order to ward off the blow of the sword. At this
    Amir al-mu\'minin turned his face away and spared him his life. The
    famous Arab poet al-Farazdaq said about it:\
    There is no good in warding off trouble by ignominy as was done one
    day by \`Amr ibn al-\`As by display of his private parts.\
    Even in this ignoble act \`Amr ibn al-\`As had not the credit of
    doing it himself, but had rather followed another one who had
    preceded him, because the man who first adopted this device was
    Talhah ibn Abi Talhah who had saved his life in the battle of Uhud
    by becoming naked before Amir al-mu\'minin, and so he showed this
    way to the others. Thus, besides \`Amr ibn al-\`As this trick was
    played by Busr ibn Abi Artat also to save himself from the sword of
    Amir al-mu\'minin. When after the performance of this notable deed
    Busr went to Mu\`awiyah the latter recalled \`Amr ibn al-\`As\'s act
    as precedent in order to remove this man\'s shamefulness and said,
    \"O\' Busr, no matter. There is nothing to feel shameful about it in
    view of \`Amr ibn al-\`As\'s precedent before
    you.\"]
