despite both these things they exhibited cowardice, while we do not
thunder until we pounce upon the foe nor do we show flow (of words)

-  About the people
    of Jamal (i.e. the enemy in the battle of Jamal) Amir al-mu\'minin
    says that they rose thundering, shouting and stampeding but when
    encounter took place they were seen flying like straw. At one time
    they made loud claims that they would do this and would do that and
    now they showed such cowardice as to flee from the battle-field.
    About himself Amir al-mu\'minin says, that \"We do not threaten the
    enemy before battle, nor utter boasts, nor terrorise the enemy by
    raising unnecessary cries because it is not the way of the brave to
    use the tongue instead of the hand.\" That is why on this occasion
    he said to his comrades: \"Beware of excessive talk as it is
    cowardice.\"]
