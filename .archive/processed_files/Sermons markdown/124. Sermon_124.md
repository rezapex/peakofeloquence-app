*Exhorting his followers to fight*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> في حضّ أصحابه على القتال

Put the armoured man forward and keep the unarmoured one behind. Grit
your teeth because this will make the swords skip off the skull, and
dodge on the sides of the spears for it changes the direction of their
blades. Close the eyes because it strengthens the spirit and gives peace
to the heart. Kill the voices because this will keep off spiritlessness.

> فَقَدِّمُوا الدَّارِعَ، وَأَخِّرُوا الْحَاسِرَ، وَعَضُّوا عَلَى الاْضْرَاسِ فَإِنَّهُ أَنْبَى لِلسُّيُوفِ عَنِ
> الْهَامِ، وَالْتَوُوا فِي أَطْرَافِ الرِّمَاحِ فَإِنَّهُ أَمْوَرُ لِلاْسِنَّةِ، وَغُضُّوا الاْبْصَارَ فَإِنَّهُ
> أَرْبَطُ لَلْجَأْشِ وَأسْكَنُ لِلْقُلُوبِ، وَأَمِيتُوا الاْصْوَاتَ فَإِنَّهُ أطْرَدُ لِلْفَشَلِ.

Do not let your banner bend down, nor leave it alone. Do not give it to
anyone except the brave and the defenders of honour among you because
they alone endure the befalling of troubles; they surround the banners
and encircle them on both sides, their rear and their front. They do not
separate from them lest they give them over (to the enemy). They do not
go ahead of them lest they leave them alone. Everyone should deal with
his adversary and also help his comrade by his own life, and should not
leave the adversary to his comrade lest both his own adversary and his
comrade join against him.

> وَرَايَتَكُمْ فَلاَ تُمِيلُوهَا وَلاَ تُخِلُّوهَا، وَلاَ تَجْعَلُوهَا إِلاَّ بِأَيْدِي شُجْعَانِكُمْ،
> وَالمَانِعِينَ الذِّمَارَ مِنْكُمْ، فَإِنَّ الصَّابِرِينَ عَلَى نُزُولِ الْحَقَائِقِ هُمُ الَّذِينَ يَحُفُّونَ
> بِرَايَاتِهمْ، وَيَكْتَنِفُونَهَا: حفَافَيْهَا، وَوَرَاءَهَا، وَأَمَامَهَا، لاَ يَتَأَخَّرُونَ عَنْهَا
> فَيُسْلِمُوهَا، وَلاَ يَتَقَدَّمُونَ عَلَيْهَا فَيُفْرِدُوهَا. أَجْزَأَ امْرُؤٌ قِرْنَهُ، وَآسَى أَخَاهُ بِنَفْسِهِ،
> وَلَمْ يَكِلْ قِرْنَهُ إِلَى أَخِيهِ فَيَجْتَمِعَ عَلَيْهِ قِرْنُهُ وَقِرْنُ أَخِيهِ.

By Allah, even if you run away from the sword of today you would not
remain safe from the sword of the next world. You are the foremost among
the Arabs and great figures. Certainly in running away there is the
wrath of Allah, unceasing disgrace and lasting shame.

And certainly a runner-away does not lengthen his life, nor does any
thing come to intervene between him and his day (of death). Who is there
to go towards Allah like the thirsty going to the water? Paradise lies
under the edges of spears. Today the reputations (about the valour of
warriors) will be tested.

By Allah! I am more eager to meet them (in combat) than they are for
(returning to) their houses. O My God! If they reject truth disperse
their group, divide their words (opinion) and destroy them on account of
their sins.

> وَايْمُ اللهِ لَئِنْ فَرَرْتُمْ مِنْ سَيْفِ الْعَاجِلَةِ، لاَ تَسْلَمُوا مِنْ سَيْفِ الاْخِرَةِ، أَنْتُمْ
> لَهَامِيمُ الْعَرَبِ، وَالسَّنَامُ الاْعْظَمُ، إِنَّ فِي الْفِرَارِ مَوْجِدَةَ اللهِ، وَالذُّلَّ اللاَّزِمَ،
> وَالْعَارَ الْبَاقِيَ، وَإِنَّ الْفَارَّ لَغَيْرُ مَزِيد فِي عُمُرِهِ، وَلاَ مَحْجُوز بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ يَوْمِهِ.
> مَنْ رائِحٌ إِلَى اللهِ كَالظَّمَآنِ يَرِدُ الْمَاءَ؟ الْجَنَّةُ تَحْتَ أَطْرَافِ الْعَوَالِي ! الْيَوْمَ
> تُبْلَى الاْخْبَارُ! وَاللهِ لاَنَا أَشْوَقُ إِلَى لِقَائِهِمْ مِنْهُمْ إِلَى دِيَارِهِمْ . اللَّهُمَّ فَإِنْ
> رَدُّوا الْحَقَّ فَافْضُضْ جَمَاعَتَهُمْ، وَشَتِّتْ كَلِمَتَهُمْ، وَأَبْسِلْهُمْ بِخَطَايَاهُمْ.

They will not budge from their stand till the continuous striking of
spears causes piercings (of wounds) through which wind may pass, and the
hitting of swords cuts through the skull, cleaves bones and breaks
forearms and legs, till they are attacked by contingent after contingent
and assaulted by detachments which are followed by reserves for support,
till their cities are continuously assailed by force after force, and
till the horses trample even the extreme ends of the lands, the tracks
of their beast and their meadows.

> إِنَّهُمْ لَنْ يَزُولُوا عَنْ مَوَاقِفِهمْ دُونَ طَعْن دِرَاك يَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ النَّسِيمُ، وَضَرْب يَفْلِقُ
> الْهَامَ، وَيُطِيحُ العِظَامَ، وَيُنْدِرُ السَّوَاعِدَ وَالاْقدْاَمَ، وَحَتَّى يُرْمَوْا بِالمَنَاسِرِ
> تَتْبَعُهَا الْمَنَاسَرُ، وَيُرْجَمُوا بِالْكَتَائِبِ، تَقْفُوهَا الْحَلاَئِبُ حَتَّى يُجَرَّ بِبِلاَدِهِمُ
> الْخَمِيسُ يَتْلُوهُ الْخَمِيسُ، وَحَتَّى تَدْعَقَ الْخُيُولُ فِي نَوَاحِر أَرْضِهِمْ، وَبِأَعْنَانِ مَسَارِبِهِمْ
> وَمَسَارِحِهِمْ.

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says**: *\"ad-da'q\"* means trampling, e.g.,
*\"taduqqu\'l-khuyulu bihawafiriha ardahum\"* (the horses trample the
ground with their hoofs). *\"nawahini ardihim\"* means lands opposite
each other, it is said, *\"manazilu bani fulanin tatanaharu\"* meaning
the \'houses of so-and-so are opposite each other.\'

> قال الشريف: الدّعْقُ: الدّقُّ، أي: تَدُقُّ الخُيُولُ بِحَوَافِرِهَا أرْضَهُمْ. نَوَاحِرُ أَرْضِهِمْ:
> مُتَقَابِلاَتُهَا، يُقَالُ: مَنَازِلُ بَنِي فُلان تتَنَاحَرُ، أيْ: تَتَقَابَلُ.

-  Amir al-mu\'minin
    delivered this Sermon on the occasion of the battle of Siffin. This
    battle was fought in the year 37 A.H. between Amir al-mu\'minin and
    the Governor of Syria (ash-Sham), Mu\`awiyah, for the so-called
    avenging for the killing of Caliph \`Uthman. But in reality it was
    nothing more than Mu\`awiyah who had been the Autonomous Governor of
    Syria from Caliph \`Umar\'s days not wanting to lose that position
    by swearing allegiance to Amir al-mu\'minin but wanting to keep his
    authority intact by exploiting the killing of Caliph \`Uthman, for
    later events proved that after securing the government he did not
    take any practical step to avenge \`Uthman\'s blood, and never
    spoke, not even through omission, about the killers of \`Uthman.\
    Although from the first day Amir al-mu\'minin realised that war was
    inevitable, it was still necessary to exhaust all pleas. Therefore
    when on Monday the 12th Rajeb, 36 A.H. he returned to Kufah after
    the battle of Jamal he sent Jarir ibn \`Abdallah al-Bajali with a
    letter to Mu\`awiyah at Damascus wherein he wrote that the muhajirun
    and the ansar had sworn allegiance to him and that he too should
    first swear him allegiance and thereafter place the case of
    \`Uthman\'s killing before him so that he could pass verdict thereon
    according to the Qur\'an and Sunnah. But Mu\`awiyah detained Jarir
    on several pretexts and after consulting \`Amr ibn al-\`As staged a
    revolt on the excuse of \`Uthman\'s killing, and with the help of
    important persons of Syria convinced the ignorant people that the
    liability for \`Uthman\'s life lay on \`Ali (p.b.u.h) and that he,
    with his conduct had encouraged the besiegers and had given them
    protection. Meanwhile he hung the blood-stained shirt of \`Uthman
    and the amputated fingers of his wife Na\'ilah bint al-Farafisah on
    the pulpit in the Central Mosque of Damascus around which seventy
    thousand Syrians cried and swore the pledge to avenge \`Uthman\'s
    blood. When Mu\`awiyah had roused the feelings of the Syrians to
    such an extent that they were determined to lay down their lives and
    be killed, he secured their allegiance on the cause of avenging
    \`Uthman\'s blood and busied himself in equipping for the battle.
    Thereafter, he showed all this to Jarir and then sent him back
    mortified.\
    When Amir al-mu\'minin learnt of these matters through Jarir ibn
    \`Abdallah al-Bajali he was forced to rise against Mu\`awiyah, and
    ordered Malik ibn Habib al-Yarbu\`i to mobilise the forces in the
    valley of An-Nukhaylah. Consequently, people from the suburbs of
    Kufah began arriving there in large numbers, till they exceeded
    eighty thousand. First of all, Amir al-mu\'minin sent a vanguard
    contingent, eight thousand strong, under Ziyad ibn an-Nadr
    al-Harithi and another of four thousand strong under Shurayh ibn
    Hani al-Harithi towards Syria. After the departure of this vanguard
    contingent he himself set out for Syria at the head of the remaining
    army on Wednesday the 5th of Shawwal. When he was out of the
    boundary of Kufah he offered zuhr (noon) prayer and after staying at
    Dayr Abi Musa, Nahr (river) Nars, Qubbat Qubbin, Babil, Dayr Ka\`b,
    Karbala\', Sabat, Bahurasini, al-Anbar and al-Jazirah arrived at
    ar-Riqqah. The people of this place were in favour of \`Uthman, and
    at this very place Simak ibn Makhtamah al-Asadi was putting up with
    his eight hundred men. These people had left Kufah to join
    Mu\`awiyah after deserting Amir al-mu\'minin; when they had seen
    Amir al-mu\'minin\'s force they had dismantled the bridge over the
    River Euphrates so that Amir al-mu\'minin\'s army should not cross
    over to the other side of the River. But at the threatening of Malik
    ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar an-Nakha\`i they were frightened, and after
    consultations among themselves they put the bridge together again
    and Amir al-mu\'minin passed over it with his army. When he alighted
    on the other side of the River he saw that Ziyad and Shurayh were
    also putting up there along with their men since both of them had
    adopted the land route. When, on reaching here, they found that
    Mu\`awiyah was advancing with his armies towards the Euphrates and
    thinking that they would not be able to face him, they stopped there
    waiting for Amir al-mu\'minin. When they had given the reason for
    their stopping there, Amir al-mu\'minin accepted their plea and sent
    them forward. When they reached Sur ar-Rum they found that Abu
    al-A\`war as-Sulami was camping there with his army. Both of them
    informed Amir al-mu\'minin of this, whereupon he despatched Ma1ik
    ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar an-Nakha\`i in their wake as the Officer in
    Command and cautioned him not to initiate the fighting but to try to
    counsel them and apprise them of the correct position as far as
    possible. In this way, on reaching there Malik al-Ashtar encamped a
    little distance away. Fighting could have commenced any moment, but
    he did not interfere with the other side nor did he take any step by
    which fighting could have been commenced. But Abu al-A\`war suddenly
    attacked them at night, whereupon they took their swords out of the
    sheaths and prepared to repulse them. Clashes between the two sides
    went on for sometime but in the end, taking benefit of the darkness
    of night Abu al-A\`war fled away. Since fighting had already
    commenced, soon after the appearance of dawn an Iraqi commander,
    Hashim ibn \`Utbah al-Mirqal az-Zuhri, took his position in the
    battlefield. From the other side also a contingent came to face him,
    and the flames of fighting rose high. At last Malik al-Ashtar
    challenged Abu al-A\`war to fight him, but he did not dare to face
    him, and towards the evening Malik al-Ashtar went onwards with his
    men. The next day Amir al-mu\'minin reached there with his force and
    set off for Siffin with the vanguard contingent and other forces.
    Mu\`awiyah had already reached there and had set up his bases. He
    had also placed a guard on the Euphrates and had occupied it. On
    reaching there Amir al-mu\'minin sent him word to remove the guard
    from Euphrates, but he refused, whereupon the Iraqis took out their
    swords and in a courageous attack captured the Euphrates. When this
    stage was over Amir al-mu\'minin sent Bashir ibn \`Amr al-Ansari,
    Sa\`id ibn Qays al-Hamdani and Shabath ibn Rib\`i at-Tamimi to
    Mu\`awiyah to apprise him of the consequences of war and to make him
    agree to settlement and allegiance. But his reply was that they
    could not by any means let \`Uthman\'s blood remain neglected, and
    that now the sword alone would arbitrate between them. Consequently
    in the month of Dhi\'l-hijjah 36 A.H. both the parties decided on
    war and warriors from each side came out into the field to face
    their adversary. Those who entered the battlefield from Amir
    al-mu\'minin\'s side were: Hujr ibn \`Adi al-Kindi, Shabath ibn
    Rib\`i at-Tamimi, Khalid ibn al-Mu\`ammar, Ziyad ibn an-Nadr
    al-Harithi, Ziyad ibn Khasafah at-Taymi, Sa\`id ibn Qays al-Hamdani,
    Qays ibn Sa\`d al-Ansari and Malik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar
    an-Nakha\`i while from the Syrians there were, \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn
    Khalid ibn Walid al-Makhzuni, Abu al-A\`war as-Sulami, Habib ibn
    Maslamah al-Fihri, \`Abdallah ibn Dhi\'l-Kala\` al-Himyari,
    \`Ubaydallah ibn \`Umar ibn al-Khattab, Shurahbil ibn Simt al-Kindi,
    and Hamzah ibn Malik al-Hamdani. When the month of Dhi\'l-hijjah
    came to end the fighting had to be stopped for Muharram, but from
    the first of Safar fighting was resumed and both parties arrayed
    themselves opposite each other, equipped with swords, spears and
    other weapons. On Amir al-mu\'minin\'s side Malik al-Ashtar was in
    command of the horsemen and \`Ammar ibn Yasir of the foot soldiers
    of Kufah while Sahl ibn Hunayf al-Ansari was in command of the
    horsemen and Qays ibn Sa\`d of the foot soldiers of Basrah. The
    banner of the army was given to Hashim ibn \`Utbah. In the army of
    the Syrians on the right hand contingent Ibn Dhi\'l-Kala\` was in
    command, while on the left hand contingent Habib ibn Maslamah, on
    horsemen \`Amr ibn al-\`As and on foot soldiers ad-Dahhak ibn Qays
    al-Fihri were in command.\
    On the first day Malik ibn al-Ashtar entered the battle-field with
    his men, and from the other side Habib ibn Maslamah came out with
    his men to face him and from both sides a fierce battle ensued.
    Throughout the day swords clashed with swords and spears with
    spears.\
    Next day, Hashim ibn \`Utbah came out with \`Ali\'s army and from
    the other side Abu al-A\`war with his footmen came to face him. When
    the two armies approached near to each other, horsemen fell upon
    horsemen and footmen upon footmen and continued attacking each
    other. and they endured with great patience and steadfastness.\
    On the third day, \`Ammar ibn Yasir and Ziyad ibn an-Nadr came out
    with horsemen and foot soldiers and from the other side \`Amr ibn
    al-\`As came forward with a big force. Ziyad attacked the horsemen
    of the opposite side and Malik al-Ashtar attacked the foot soldiers
    so furiously that the enemy\'s men lost ground and, failing to offer
    resistance, returned to their camps.\
    On the fourth day Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah appeared on the
    battle-field with his men. From the other side \`Ubaydallah ibn
    \`Umar came forward with the Syrian army and both the armies had a
    serious encounter.\
    On the fifth day \`Abdallah ibn \`Abbas came forward and from the
    other side al-Walid ibn \`Uqba ibn Abi Mu\`ayt came to face him.
    \`Abdallah ibn \`Abbas carried the assaults with great steadfastness
    and courage and gave such a brave fight that the enemy left the
    field in retreat.\
    On the sixth day Qays ibn Sa\`d al-Ansari came forward with the army
    and to face him Ibn Dhi\'l-Kala\` came out with his contingent, and
    such a severe fighting ensued that at every step bodies were seen
    falling and blood flowing like streams. At last the darkness of the
    night separated the two armies.\
    On the seventh day Malik al-Ashtar came out and to face him, Habib
    ibn Maslamah came forward with his men, and fighting raged till zuhr
    (noon).\
    On the eighth day Amir al-mu\'minin himself came out with the army
    and made such an assault that the entire battlefield quaked, and
    piercing through the ranks and warding off shots of arrows and
    spears he came and stood between both the lines. Then he challenged
    Mu\`awiyah, whereupon the latter, along with \`Amr ibn al-\`As, came
    a bit closer. Then Amir al-mu\'minin said to him: \"Come out and
    face me. Let whoever kills the other be the ruler.\" Whereupon \`Amr
    ibn al-\`As said to Mu\`awiyah: \"\`Ali is right. Gather up a little
    courage and face him. Mu\`awiyah replied: \"l am not prepared to
    waste my life ar your taunting.\" Saying this he went back. When
    Amir al-mu\'minin saw him retreating he smiled and himself too
    returned. The daring with which Amir al-mu\'minin led the attacks in
    Siffin can only be called a miraculous feat. Thus, whenever he came
    out challenging in the battlefield, the enemy lines were dispersed
    into utter disarray and confusion, and even courageous combatants
    hesitated to appear against him. That is why on a few occasions he
    came onto the battlefield in changed dress so that the enemy should
    not recognise him and someone should be prepared to engage with him
    personally. Once \`Arar ibn Ad\'ham came from the other side to
    engage with al-\`Abbas ibn Rabi\`ah al-Harith ibn \`Abd al-Muttalib.
    They remained engaged but neither could defeat the other, until
    al-\`Abbas chanced to see that a link of his adversary\'s armour was
    loose. With a swift stroke he entangled the point of his sword in
    it, and then with a quick jerk he cut through a few more links. Then
    with true aim he gave such a blow that his sword went straight into
    his bosom. Seeing this, people raised the call of takbir. Mu\`awiyah
    was startled at this noise and on coming to know that \`Arar ibn
    Ad\'ham had been slain he was much disturbed and shouted if there
    was anyone to take revenge for \`Arar ibn Ad\'ham and kill
    al-\`Abbas, whereupon some tired swordsmen of the tribe of Lakhm
    came out challenging al-\`Abbas. Al-\`Abbas said he would come after
    taking his Chief\'s permission. Saying al-\`Abbas came to Amir
    al-mu\'minin to seek permission. Amir al-mu\'minin detained him, put
    on al-\`Abbas\'s dress. and riding on al-\`Abbas\'s horse entered
    the battlefield. Taking him to be al-\`Abbas, the Lakhms said: \"So
    you have got your Chief\'s permission.\" In reply Amir al-mu\'minin
    recited the following verse:\
    Permission (to fight) is given unto those upon whom war is made for
    they have been oppressed, and verily, to help them, Allah is Most
    Potent. (Qur\'an, 22:39)\
    Now one man came out from the other side shouting like an elephant,
    ran amok and assaulted Amir al-mu\'minin, but he avoided the blow
    and then gave such a clean cut with his sword to the other\'s back
    that he was split into two. People thought the blow had gone without
    avail, but when his horse jumped his two separate parts fell on the
    ground. After him another man came out but he too was finished in
    the twinkling of an eye. Then Amir al-mu\'minin challenged others
    but from the strokes of his sword the enemy came to know that it was
    Amir al-mu\'minin in the dress of al-\`Abbas and so none dared come
    to face him.\
    On the ninth day the right wing was under the command of \`Abdullah
    ibn Budayl and the left wing under that of \`Abdullah ibn
    al-\`Abbas. In the centre was Amir al-mu\'minin himself. On the
    other side Habib ibn Maslamah commanded the Syrian army. When both
    the lines had come face to face with each other, the valiant
    soldiers drew out their swords and pounced upon one another like
    ferocious lions, and fighting raged on all sides. The banner of the
    right wing Amir al-mu\'minin\'s army was revolving in the hands of
    Banu Hamdan. Whenever anyone of them fell, martyred, someone else
    would pick up the banner. First of all Kurayb ibn Shurayh raised the
    banner, on his fall Shurahbil ibn Shurayh took it up, then Marthad
    ibn Shurayh, then Hubayrah ibn Shurayh then Yarim ibn Shurayh, then
    Sumayr ibn Shurayh and after the killing of all these six brothers
    the banner was taken up by Sufyan, then \`Abd, then Kurayb, the
    three sons of Zayd, who all fell martyred. After that the banner was
    lifted by two brothers (sons) of Bashir namely \`Umayr and al-Harith
    and when they too fell martyred, Wahb ibn Kurayb took up the banner.
    On this day the enemy\'s greater attention was on the right wing and
    its assaults were so fierce that the men lost ground and began to
    retreat from the battlefield. Only three hundred men remained with
    the Officer in Command \`Abdullah ibn Budayl. On seeing this Amir
    al-mu\'minin asked Malik al-Ashtar to call them back and challenge
    them as to where they were fleeing. \"If the days of life are over
    they cannot avoid death by running away.\" Now the defeat of the
    right wing could not be without effect on the left wing, so Amir
    al-mu\'minin turned to the left wing and advanced forward, forcing
    through the enemy lines, whereupon a slave of Banu Umayyah named
    Ahmar said to him, \"Allah may make me die if I fail to slay you
    today.\" On hearing this Amir al-mu\'minin\'s slave Kaysan leapt
    over him but was killed by him. When Amir al-mu\'minin saw this he
    caught him by the skirt of his armour and, picking him up, threw him
    down so forcefully that all his joints were smashed, whereupon Imam
    Hasan (p.b.u.h.) and Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah came forward and
    despatched him to Hell. Meanwhile, after having been called to Malik
    al-Ashtar and his having made them feel ashamed, the retreaters came
    back and again assaulted so steadfastly that pushing back the enemy
    they reached the place where \`Abdullah ibn Budayl was surrounded by
    the enemy. When he saw his own men he picked up courage and leapt
    towards Mu\`awiyah\'s tent with drawn sword. Malik al-Ashtar tried
    to stop him but he couldn\'t, and, killing seven Syrians, he reached
    the tent of Mu\`awiyah. When Mu\`awiyah noticed him close by he
    ordered him to be stoned, as a result of which he was overpowered
    and the Syrians crowded over him and killed him. When Malik
    al-Ashtar saw this he proceeded forward with the combatants of Banu
    Hamdan and Banu Madh\'hij for an attack on Mu\`awiyah, and began
    dispersing the contingent on guard around him. When, out of the five
    circles of his guards only one remained to be dispersed, Mu\`awiyah
    put his foot in the stirrup of his horse in order to run away, but
    on someone\'s encouragement again stopped. On another side of the
    battlefield a tumult was raging from one end to the other by the
    swords of \`Ammar ibn Yasir and Hashim ibn \`Utbah. From whatever
    side \`Ammar passed, the companions (of the Holy Prophet) flocked
    around him and then made such a joint assault that destruction
    spread throughout the enemy lines. When Mu\`awiyah saw them
    advancing he threw his fresh forces towards them. But he continued
    displaying the excellence of his bravery under the storm of swords
    and spears. At last Abu al-\`Adiyah al-Juhani hit him with a spear
    from which he could not balance himself and then Ibn Hawiy (Jawn
    as-Saksiki) came forward and slew him. \`Ammar ibn Yasir\'s death
    caused tumult in Mu\`awiyah\'s ranks because about him they had
    heard the Holy Prophet (S) having said: \" \`Ammar will be killed at
    the hands of a rebellious party.\" Thus before he fell as martyr
    Dhu\'l-Kala\` had said to \`Amr ibn al-\`As: \"I see \`Ammar on
    \`Ali\'s side; are we that rebellious party?\" \`Amr ibn al-\`As had
    assured him that eventually \`Ammar would join them, but when he
    killed fighting on \`Ali\'s side the rebellious party stood exposed
    and no scope was left for any other interpretation. Nevertheless
    Mu\`awiyah started telling the Syrians that: \"We did not kill
    \`Ammar, but \`Ali did it because he brought him to the
    battlefield.\" When Amir al-mu\'minin heard this cunning sentence he
    remarked: \"In that case the Holy Prophet (S) killed Hamzah as he
    had brought him to the battlefield of Uhud.\" Hashim ibn \`Utbah
    also fell in this conflict. He was killed by al-Harith ibn Mundhir
    at-Tanukhi. After him the banner of the contingent was taken over by
    his son \`Abdullah.\
    When such fearless warriors were gone Amir al-mu\'minin said to the
    warriors from the tribes of Hamdan and Rabi\`ah: \"To me you are
    like armour and spear. Get up and teach these rebels a lesson. \"
    Consequently, twelve thousand combatants of the tribes of Rabi\`ah
    and Hamdan stood up, swords in hand. The banner was taken up by
    Hudayn ibn al-Mundhir. Entering the lines of the enemy, they used
    their swords in such a way that heads began to drop, bodies fell in
    huge heaps and on every side streams of blood flowed. And the
    assaults of these swordsmen knew no stopping till the day began to
    end with all its devastation and the gloom of eve set in, ushering
    in that fearful night which is known in history as the night of
    al-Harir, wherein the clashing of weapons, the hoofs of horses and
    the hue and cry of the Syrians created such notice that even voices
    reaching the ears could not be heard. On Amir al-mu\'minin\'s side,
    his wrong-crushing slogans raised waves of courage and valour, and
    on the enemy\'s side they shook the hearts in their bosoms. The
    battle was at its zenith. The quivers of the bowmen had become
    empty. The stalks of the spears had been broken. Hand to hand
    fighting went on with swords only and dead bodies collected in
    heaps, till by morning the number of killed had exceeded thirty
    thousand.\
    On the tenth day Amir al-mu\'minin\'s men showed the same morale. On
    the right wing Malik al-Ashtar held the command and on the left wing
    \`Abdullah ibn al-\`Abbas.\
    Assaults went on like the assaults of new soldiers. Signs of defeat
    appeared on the Syrians, and they were about to leave the
    battlefield and run away, when five hundred Qur\'ans were raised on
    spears changing the entire face of the battle. Moving swords
    stopped, the weapon of deceit was successful, and the way was clear
    for wrong to hold its sway.\
    In this battle forty-five thousand Syrians were killed while
    twenty-five thousand Iraqis fell as martyrs. (Kitab Siffin by Nasr
