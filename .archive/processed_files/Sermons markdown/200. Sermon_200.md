*Treason and treachery of Mu'awiyah and the fate of those guilty of
treason*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> في معاوية

By Allah, {#epub.html_fref_fe5c0e4d_1
.see-footnote} Mu'awiyah is not more cunning than I am, but he deceives
and commits evil deeds. Had it not been for the reprehensibility of
deceit, I would have been the most cunning of all men. But (the fact is
that) every deceit is a sin and every sin is disobedience (of Allah),
and every deceitful person will have a banner by which he will be
recognised on the Day of Judgement. By Allah, I cannot be made forgetful
by strategy, nor can I be overpowered by hardships.

> وَاللهِ مَا مُعَاوِيَةُ بِأَدْهَى مِنِّي، وَلكِنَّهُ يَغْدِرُ وَيَفْجُرُ، وَلَوْلاَ كَرَاهِيَةُ الْغَدْرِ لَكُنْتُ
> مِنْ أَدْهَى النَّاسِ، وَلَكِنْ كُلُّ غَدْرَة فَجْرَةٌ، وَكُلُّ فَجْرَة كَفْرَةٌ، وَلِكُلِّ غَادِر لِوَاءٌ يُعْرَفُ
> بِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ. وَاللهِ مَا أَسْتَغْفَلُ بالْمَكِيدَةِ، وَلاَ أُسْتَغْمَزُ بالشَّدِيدَةِ.

-  People who are
    ignorant of religion and ethics free from the shackles of religious
    law and unaware of the conception of punishment and reward find no
    paucity of excuses and means for the achievement of their objects.
    They can find ways of success at every stage; but when the dictates
    of humanity, or Islam, or the limitations imposed by ethics and
    religious law act as impediments, the chances of devising and
    finding means become narrow, and the possibility of action becomes
    restricted. Mu\`awiyah\'s influence and control was the result of
    these devices and ways in following which he knew no impediment nor
    any obstacle of what is lawful or unlawful, nor did fear of the Day
    of Judgement prevent him from acting fearlessly. As al-\`Allamah
    ar-Raghib al-Isfahani while taking account of his characters
    writes:]

    \"His aim always was to achieve his object whether lawful or
    unlawful. He did not care for religion nor did he ever think of
    divine chastisement. Thus, in order to maintain his power he
    resorted to mis-statements and concoctions, practised all sorts of
    deceits and contrivances. When he saw that success was not possible
    without entangling Amir al-mu\'minin in war he roused Talhah and
    az-Zubayr against him. When success could not be achieved by this
    means he instigated the Syrians and brought about the civil war of
    Siffin. And when his rebellious position had become known by the
    killing of \`Ammar, he at once duped the people by saying that \`Ali
    was responsible for killing him as he had brought him into the
    battlefield; and on another occasion he interpreted the words
    \'rebellious party\' occurring in the saying of the Prophet to mean
    \'avenging party\' intending to prove that \`Ammar would be killed
    by the group that would seek revenge of \`Uthman\'s blood, although
    the next portion of this saying namely \'he will call them towards
    Paradise while they will call him to Hell,\' does not leave any
    scope for interpretation. When there was no hope of victory even by
    these cunning means, he contrived to raise the Qur\'an on spears,
    although in his view neither the Qur\'an nor its commandments
    carried any weight. If he had really aimed at a decision by the
    Qur\'an, he should have put this demand before the commencement of
    the battle, and when it became known to him that the decision had
    been secured by \`Amr ibn al-\`As by deceiving Abu Musa al-Ash\`ari,
    and that it did not have even a remote connection with the Qur\'an,
    he should not have accepted it and should have punished \`Amr ibn
    al-\`As for this cunning, or at least should have warned and rebuked
    him. But on the contrary, his performance was much appreciated and
    in reward he was made the Governor of Egypt.\"

    In contrast to this Amir al-mu\'minin\'s conduct was a high specimen
    of religious law and ethics. He kept in view the requirements of
    truth and righteousness even in adverse circumstances and did not
    allow his chaste life to be tarnished by the views of deceit and
    contrivance. If he wished he could face cunning by cunning, and
    Mu\`awiyah\'s shameful activities could have been answered by
    similar activities. For example, when he put a guard on the
    Euphrates and stopped the supply of its water (to Amir
    al-mu\'minin\'s men), then the supply of water could have been cut
    from them also on the grounds that since they had occupied the
    Euphrates it was lawful to retaliate, and in this way they could be
    overpowered by weakening their fighting power. But Amir al-mu\'minin
    could never tarnish his hands with such an inhuman act which was not
    permitted by any law or code of ethics, although common people
    regard such acts against the enemy as lawful and call this duplicity
    of character for achievement of success, a stroke of policy and
    administrative ability. But Amir al-mu\'minin could never think of
    strengthening his power by fraud or duplicity of behaviour on any
    occasion. Thus when people advised him to retain the officers of the
    days of \`Uthman in their position and to befriend Talhah and
    az-Zubayr by assigning them governorship of Kufah and Basrah, and
    make use of Mu\`awiyah\'s ability in administration by giving him
    the government of Syria, Amir al-mu\'minin rejected the advice and
    preferred the commandments of religious law over worldly expediency,
    and openly declared about Mu\`awiyah as follows:\
    If I allow Mu\`awiyah to retain what he already has I would be one
    \"who taketh those who lead (people) astray, as helpers\" (Qur\'an,
    18:51). Those who look at apparent successes do not care to find out
    by what means the success has been achieved. They support anyone
    whom they see succeeding by means of cunning ways and deceitful
    means and begin to regard him an administrator, intelligent, a
    politician, intellectually brilliant and so on, while he who does
    not deploy cunning and fraudulent methods owing to his adherence to
    Islamic commandments and divine instructions and prefers failure to
    success secured through wrong methods is regarded as ignorant of
    politics and weak in foresight. They do not feel it necessary to
    think what difficulties and impediments exist in the way of a person
    who adheres to principles and laws which prevent him from proceeding
    forward even after approaching near success.\"
