The\\nwind blew under it while water flowed furiously over it.\\nThen Almighty created forth wind and made its movement sterile, perpetuated its position,\\nintensified its motion and spread it far and wide. Then He ordered the wind to raise up deep\\nwaters and to intensify the waves of the oceans. So the wind churned it like the churning of\\ncurd and pushed it fiercely into the firmament throwing its front position on the rear and the\\nstationary on the flowing till its level was raised and the surface was full of foam.\\nThen Almighty raised the foam on to the open wind and vast firmament and made therefrom\\nthe seven skies and made the lower one as a stationary surge and the upper one as protective\\nceiling and a high edifice without any pole to support it or nail to hold it together. Then He\\ndecorated them with stars and the light of meteors and hung in it the shining sun and effulgent\\nmoon under the revolving sky, moving ceiling and rotating firmament.\"}]},{\"type\":\"element\",\"tag\":\"p\",\"props\":{},\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"The Creation of the Angels\\nThen He created the openings between high skies and filled them with all classes of His\\nangels.

He solidified it till it dried up for a fixed time and a known\\nduration.\\nThen He blew into it out of His Spirit whereupon it took the pattern of a human being with\\nmind that governs him, intelligence which he makes use of, limbs that serve him, organs that\\nchange his position, sagacity that differentiates between truth and untruth, tastes and smells,\\ncolours and species.\\nHe is a mixture of clays of different colours, cohesive materials, divergent contradictories and\\ndiffering properties like heat, cold, softness and hardness.\\nThen Allah asked the angels to fulfil His promise with them and to accomplish the pledge of\\nHis injunction to them by acknowledging Him through prostration to Him and submission to\\nHis honoured position.

Thus, He said:\\n\\\"Verily you have been allowed time till the known Day.\\\" (Qur'an, 15:38; 38:81)\\nThereafter, Allah inhabited Adam (p.b.u.h.) in a house where He made his life pleasant and\\nhis stay safe, and He cautioned him of Iblis and his enmity. Then his enemy (Iblis) envied his\\nabiding in Paradise and his contacts with the virtuous.\\nSo he changed his conviction into wavering and determination into weakness. He thus\\nconverted his happiness into fear and his prestige into shame. Then Allah offered to Adam (p.\\nb.u.h.) the chance to repent, taught him words of His Mercy, promised him return to His\\nParadise and sent him down to the place of trial and procreation of progeny.\"}]},{\"type\":\"element\",\"tag\":\"p\",\"props\":{},\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Allah chooses His Prophets\\nFrom his (Adam's) progeny Allah chose prophets and took their pledge for his revelation and\\nfor carrying His message as their trust.

Satan turned them\\naway from knowing Him and kept them aloof from His worship.\\nThen Allah sent His Messengers and series of His prophets towards them to get them to fulfil\\nthe pledges of His creation, to recall to them His bounties, to exhort them by preaching, to\\nunveil before them the hidden virtues of wisdom and show them the signs of His\\nOmnipotence namely the sky which is raised over them, the earth that is placed beneath them,\\nmeans of living that sustain them, deaths that make them die, ailments that turn them old and\\nincidents that successively betake them.\\nAllah never allowed His creation to remain without a Prophet deputised by Him, or a book\\nsent down from Him or a binding argument or a standing plea.\\nThese Messengers were such that they did not feel little because of smallness of their number\\nor of largeness of the number of their falsifiers.
