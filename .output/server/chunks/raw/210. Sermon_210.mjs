But when this selection is\\nstudied some traditions which come across can, in no circumstances,\\nbe attributed to the Prophet. The result is that a group of\\nconsiderable number has cropped up among Muslims who, in view of\\nthese (so-called) authoritative collections and true traditions,\\ncompletely reject the evidentiary value of the traditions, (For\\nfurther reference see al-Ghadir, vol.5, pp.\\n208-378).]\"},{\"type\":\"element\",\"tag\":\"br\",\"props\":{},\"children\":[]},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"The second category of relaters of traditions are those who, without\\nappreciating the occasion or context, related whatever they could\\nrecollect, right or wrong.
