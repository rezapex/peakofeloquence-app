Hearing this Imam Ali (a) felt annoyed\\nand said to him \\\"Shurayh be warned that a thing (death) will come to you; it will not take any\\nnotice of this sales deed nor will it accept the testimony of the witnesses but it will take you\\nout of this house alone and unattended and will drag you to your grave.\\nAnd before such a thing happens, you must think well over the fact whether you have\\npurchased this house with the money which does not belong to you but to somebody else and\\nwhether the purchase price was acquired with foul means or it was an ill-gotten wealth, which\\nmet its cost, if it was so, then remember that you will part (through death) with this house and\\nin the bargain you will lose your place in Paradise.\"}]},{\"type\":\"element\",\"tag\":\"p\",\"props\":{},\"children\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"If you had come to me prior to this transaction I would have drafted such a sales deed for you\\nthat you would not have cared to purchase this property even for a dirham.

On one side it is bounded by calamities and disasters, on the other\\nside with disappointments and sorrows, on the third side its borders are covered with\\ninordinate and excessive desires ending in failures and on the fourth side it adjoins the\\nmisleading and captivating allurements of Satan, and the door of this house opens towards\\nthis fourth side.\\nA man leading his life under the merciless grip of intemperate and disorderly desires has\\npurchased this house from another person who is being relentlessly pursued by death.
