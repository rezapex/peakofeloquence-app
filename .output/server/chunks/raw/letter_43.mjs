When he realised this, he\\nwanted to run away, giving up loot and plunder. Before sunset our expeditionary force\\novertook him and his guerrillas, a skirmish did take place, not worth being mentioned as a\\nbattle, and he fled. When he was caught by the throat he thought a cowardly retreat to be the\\nbest solution.\\nDo not take to heart the behaviour of Quraysh. To talk about their scepticism, their enmity of\\nIslam, their revolt against the cause of Allah and their desire to bring harm to me are a waste\\nof time. They now are as much bent upon doing me injustice and fighting against me, as they\\nwere unanimously against the Holy Prophet (s). May Allah punish them for their sins. They\\nhave not even paid any consideration to the relationship that existed between them and I.\\nThey have deprived me of the estate of my mother's son.\\nAs far as your enquiry about my intention against the enemies of Islam is concerned, my\\nopinion is to combat those who have made up their minds to harm the cause of Islam. I shall\\nkeep on combating them to the end of my life.\\nI am neither emboldened by abundance of followers nor am I disheartened by their scarcity.\\nDo not think that your brother will lose heart if people forsake him and give up their help or\\nhe will humiliate himself, bow down against heavy odds, submit to unreasonable demands of\\nothers or accept their commands or orders like a beast of burden.\\nSo far as I am concerned I am like a person about whom a poet of Bani Salim says:-\\n\\\"If you enquire about me, my beloved, Then hear me:\\nI am very strong to face calamities and reverses;\\nI cannot tolerate\\nThat signs of sorrows and griefs on my face\\nMake my enemies happy,\\nAnd increase sorrows of my friends\\\".\"}]}],\"toc\":{\"title\":\"\",\"searchDepth\":2,\"depth\":2,\"links\":[]}},\"_type\":\"markdown\",\"_id\":\"content:3.letters:letter_43.md\",\"_source\":\"content\",\"_file\":\"3.letters/letter_43.md\",\"_extension\":\"md\"},\"hash\":\"shgPjI48fX\"}";
