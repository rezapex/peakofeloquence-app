I did this under the impression that from\\nmy own clan nobody will prove more sympathetic, more helpful and more trustworthy to me\\nthan you.\\nBut when you found that the times have gone against your cousin, his enemies are on the war\\npath, wealth of the country is being recklessly plundered, the nation has lost sight of the true\\npath of religion and it is confused and confounded, then you have also changed colour. You\\nhave forsaken your cousin, you left him along with other deserters and by joining the gang of\\ndishonest persons, you have also betrayed the trust I reposed in you.\\nYou have changed so much that you have not only lost the sense of sympathy for your cousin\\nbut you have also lost the sense of honesty and virtue.\\nYour present behaviour indicates that you have never been sincere, as if your participating in\\njihad (the Holy Wars) was not in the cause of Allah and as if the true light of religion had\\nnever illuminated the dark recesses of your mind. Along with the majority, you had also\\nparticipated in jihad to amass wealth under the pretence of serving Allah and religion and\\nawaited opportunities to decamp with wealth of the Islamic State. And when the opportunity\\npresented itself to you to be dishonest to your heart's content and when you found your ruler\\nseriously engaged somewhere else you jumped at the evil chance, you invaded the Public\\nTreasury and looted as much as was possible for you, the money which was reserved for\\nwidows, orphans and the poor.\\nIn this plunder your action was so quick, so nimble and so effective that it resembled the\\naction of a very active and wary wolf attacking and snatching away a wounded and helpless\\ngoat.\\nYou have with pleasure sent this looted wealth to Hijaz.\\nThe sin pleased you and the loot made you happy. The thought that it was an evil deed never\\nstopped you from the act. Did you take it for a heritage which you can take hold of and send\\nhome? Allahu Akbar! Do you not believe in the Day of Judgement? Are you not afraid of the\\nreckoning on that Day?\\nO you whom we took for a wise and intelligent person! How can you happily and with easy\\nconscience eat and drink things purchased by this wealth being aware all the time of its\\nunlawfulness. Do you realise the enormity of your sin? Out of the money which was\\nearmarked for the use of orphans, paupers and the destitute or which was reserved for faithful\\nMuslims and Mujahids or was conserved for the defence of the Muslims State, you provided\\nfor yourself means of your enjoyments and pleasures, you purchased slave-girls out of it and\\nyou spent it on your marriages.\\nI advise you to fear Allah and return the money to those whom it rightfully belongs.\\nIf you do not do this and if Allah gives me a chance to punish you then I shall act in such a\\nway that Allah will be pleased with me. I shall give you a stroke with that sword of mine\\nwhich has sent all those whom I struck with it, to Hell. I swear by the Merciful Allah that\\neven if all the wealth which you have so wickedly looted had come into my possession in a\\nlawful way it would not have pleased me to leave it to my heir as a heirloom.\\nControl your inordinate desires, think well over what you have done and remember that you\\nhave reached the mature age, just try to visualize that death has brought an end to your life,\\nyou are lying in a grave with so much earth over you and your deeds are placed before you.\\nWhat would you say and do at such a time and place, a place where tyrants and oppressors\\ncould only repent and wish to go back to the world they left behind but there will be no\\nescape from the punishment.\"}]}],\"toc\":{\"title\":\"\",\"searchDepth\":2,\"depth\":2,\"links\":[]}},\"_type\":\"markdown\",\"_id\":\"content:3.letters:letter_48.md\",\"_source\":\"content\",\"_file\":\"3.letters/letter_48.md\",\"_extension\":\"md\"},\"hash\":\"zLEhyfaSqS\"}";
