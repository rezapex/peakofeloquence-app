It was not to be a regime whose officers had an upper hand and were fattened on\\npublic money. It was to be a regime where the governed and the tax-payers were at premium.\\nIt was their convenience for which the State was to function.\\nIt was a welfare-state working solely for the welfare of the people living under its rule, a\\nregime where the rich cannot get richer while the poor are made poorer; a regime where\\ncanons of religion hold the balance between the governed and the ruler.\\nDo not give up fearing Allah who has no partner. Do not let the Muslim grieve (over their lot\\nof having you as their ruler) and do not approach them in a way as to make your approach\\nhateful to them. Do not tax them more than what is actually due from them to Allah.\\nWhen you reach a group of people (tribe or village) to assess a tax on them, then stay only at\\ntheir watering-place (a well or water-hole the most convenient place for stay in desert\\nregions) and do not stay in their houses. Then go to them maintaining your dignity and\\nprestige and when you are in their midst, wish them peace and blessings of Allah and show\\ndue respect to them. Tell them that the Caliph of Allah has sent you to collect from them their\\ndues to Allah.\\nAsk them whether they possess enough means to pay the dues of Allah that you may gather\\nthem and pass them on to His Caliph. If somebody tells you that he does not possess enough\\nwealth to make him liable to pay taxes then do not worry him and accept his plea. If someone\\ntells you that he is in a position to pay Zakat, then go with him to his house, field or pasture\\n(because Zakat was then collected in coins as well as in kind).\\nBut do not frighten him or make him nervous and do not behave with them with undue\\nharshness or tyranny. Then accept the gold or silver which he offers.\\n(Here are the instructions regarding the number of cattle to be assessed for Zakat). If he has\\ncows, bulls, goats and camels then do not enter the herd without his permission because most\\nof it belongs to him (it is not part of Zakat). If you have to enter the herd then do not enter like\\nthe one who is coming there to take possession of the cattle. Do not tyrannize the owner, do\\nnot frighten the cattle so as to make them disperse. Do not make the owner feel anxious or\\nsorry for them. Then divide the herd into two parts and allow the owner to select the one for\\nhimself. If he selects one part for keeping himself, then do not object to it.\\nAgain divide the part which he has left for the share of Zakat to be selected from out of these\\ntwo parts, again allow him to select the lot which he wants to retain for himself. Never object\\nto his selection (because it is the assessor who is dividing them in equal lots; therefore, the\\nselection between the two lots should naturally rest with the owner). Continue like that until\\nyou arrive at the lot which constitutes the share of Allah (Zakat) then take possession of it.\\nEven if, in spite of all these precautions, he thinks the division was unfair and unjust, then\\nmix the whole lot and go through the process once again as I have already explained to you\\ntill you arrive at the share of Zakat to the satisfaction of everybody concerned. Remember you\\nhave not to accept old and diseased camels or such as have their limbs damaged. Entrust this\\nlot only to such person who is honest and who can be trusted and who can guard the property\\nof the Muslims sympathetically till it reaches their ruler and caliph so that it may be\\ndistributed equitably among the Muslims.\\nI want to instruct you once again that you should not entrust these goods and animals to\\nanyone who is not honest.\\nEntrust them to one who is trustworthy and who is of a kind and sympathetic disposition so\\nthat he may not treat the animals cruelly and may not starve them or tire them out during the\\ntransit.\\nInstruct him not to separate a she-camel from its young, not to milk it so much that nothing is\\nleft for its young one and not to ride them harshly or to overburden them with heavy loads.\\nHe should ride them in turns so that those who have been already ridden may have an easy\\njourney. He should not drive them fast and should avoid harshness. He should always give\\nthem enough rest at watering places. They should not be driven through deserts. As far as\\npossible green lands and well-wooded regions should be selected for the passage.\\nThus every care should be taken so that they reach their destination in healthy and robust\\ncondition without having received any harsh and brutal treatment on the way so that I may\\ndistribute them according to the Orders of Allah and the Holy Prophet (s). Verily, the\\ncollection of the dues of Allah in the way that I have explained to you is a pious deed and a\\nreligious duty which will carry its reward before the Lord.\"}]}],\"toc\":{\"title\":\"\",\"searchDepth\":2,\"depth\":2,\"links\":[]}},\"_type\":\"markdown\",\"_id\":\"content:3.letters:letter_28.md\",\"_source\":\"content\",\"_file\":\"3.letters/letter_28.md\",\"_extension\":\"md\"},\"hash\":\"AzEMWKY5Rb\"}";
