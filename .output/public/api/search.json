When Ziyad ibn Labid went to the tribe of Banu `Amr ibn\nMu`awiyah for collection of zakat he took keen fancy for a\nshe-camel of Shaytan ibn Hujr which was very handsome and of huge\nbody. He jumped over it and took possession of it. Shaytan ibn Hujr\ndid not agree to spare it and said to him to take over some other\nshe-camel in its place but Ziyad would not agree. Shaytan sent for\nhis brother al-`Adda' ibn Hujr for his support. On coming he too\nhad a talk but Ziyad insisted on his point and did not, by any\nmeans, consent to keep off his hand from that she-camel. At last\nboth these brothers appealed to Masruq ibn Ma`di Karib for help.\nConsequently, Masruq also used his influence so that Ziyad might\nleave the she-camel but he refused categorically, whereupon Masruq\nbecame enthusiastic and untying the she-camel handed it over to\nShaytan. On this Ziyad was infuriated and collecting his men became\nready to fight. On the other side Banu Wali`ah also assembled to\nface them, but could not defeat Ziyad and were badly beaten at his\nhands. Their women were taken away and property was looted.\nEventually those who had survived were obliged to take refuge under\nthe protection of al-Ash`ath. Al-Ash`ath promised assistance on\nthe condition that he should be acknowledged ruler of the area.\nThose people agreed to this condition and his coronation was also\nformally solemnised. After having his authority acknowledged he\narranged an army and set out to fight Ziyad. On the other side Abu\nBakr had written to the chief of Yemen, al-Muhajir ibn Abi Umayyah\nto go for the help of Ziyad with a contingent. Al-Muhajir was coming\nwith his contingent when they came face to face. Seeing each other\nthey drew swords and commenced fighting at ad-Zurqan. In the end\nal-Ash`ath fled from the battle-field and taking his remaining men\nclosed himself in the fort of an-Nujayr. The enemy was such as to\nlet them alone. They laid siege around the fort. Al-Ash`ath thought\nhow long could he remain shut up in the fort with this lack of\nequipment and men, and that he should think out some way of escape.\nSo one night he stealthily came out of the fort and met Ziyad and\nal-Muhajir and conspired with them that if they gave asylum to nine\nmembers of his family he would get the fort gate opened. They\naccepted this term and asked him to write for them the names of\nthose nine persons. He wrote down the nine names and made them over\nto them, but acting on his traditional wisdom forgot to write his\nown name in that list. After settling this he told his people that\nhe has secured protection for them and the gate of the fort should\nbe opened. When the gate was opened Ziyad forces pounced upon them.\nThey said they had been promised protection whereupon Ziyad's army\nsaid that this was wrong and that al-Ash`ath had asked protection\nonly for nine members of his house, whose names preserved with them.\nIn short eight hundred persons were put to sword and hands of\nseveral women were chopped off, while according to the settlement\nnine men were left off, but the case of al-Ash`ath became\ncomplicated. Eventually it was decided he should be sent to Abu Bakr\nand he should decided about him. At last he was sent to Medina in\nchains along with a thousand women prisoners. On the way relations\nand others, men and women, all hurled curses at him and the women\nwere calling him traitor and one who got his own people put to\nsword. Who else can be a greater traitor?

The poor\nand the starving were craving for dried crusts while Banu Umayyah\nwere rolling in wealth. The Caliphate had become a handle for\nbelly-filling and a means of amassing wealth. Consequently, they too\ndid not lag behind in preparing the ground for killing him. Rather,\nit was at their letters and messages that people from Kufah, Basrah\nand Egypt had collected in Medina. Observing this behaviour of the\npeople of Medina, `Uthman wrote to Mu`awiyah: 'So now, certainly\nthe people of Medina have turned heretics, have turned faith against\nobedience and broken the (oath of) allegiance.

On the other side many people from Kufah and Basrah\nhad also arrived with their complaints and they, after joining these\nones, proceeded forward with the backing of the people of Medina and\nconfined `Uthman within his house, although there was no\nrestriction on his going and coming to the mosque. But in his sermon\non the very first Friday he severely rebuked these people and even\nheld them accursed, whereupon people got infuriated and threw\npebbles at him as a result of which he lost control and fell from\nthe pulpit.

Whatever terms you would settle with them I would be\nbound by them.\" So Amir al-mu'minin went and met the Egyptians and\ntalked to them. They consented to get back on the condition that all\nthe tyrannies should be wiped off and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr be made\ngovernor by removing Ibn Abi Sarh. Amir al-mu'minin came back and\nput their demand before `Uthman who accepted it without any\nhesitation and said that to get over these excesses time was\nrequired. Amir al-mu'minin pointed out that for matters concerning\nMedina delay had no sense. However, for other places so much time\ncould be allowed that the Caliph's message could reach them.\n`Uthman insisted that for Medina also three days were needed.

He told the people\nthat when he alighted from the pulpit their representatives should\nmeet him, and he would remove their grievances and meet their\ndemands.

When time came to its\nannouncement there was a meeting at Dumatu'l-Jandal, a place\nbetween Iraq and Syria, and then two arbitrators also reached there\nto announce the judgement on the fate of the Muslims.

But\nthe Kharijites gave him this reply, \"When you had agreed to\nArbitration in our view you had turned heretic. Now if you admit\nyour heresy and offer repentance we will think over this matter and\ndecide what we should do.\" Amir al-mu'minin understood from their\nreply that their disobedience and misguidance had become very\nserious. To entertain any kind of hope from them now was futile.\nConsequently, ignoring them he encamped in the valley of\nan-Nukhaylah with a view to marching towards Syria. When the army\nhad been arrayed he came to know that the men desired to deal with\nthe people of Nahrawan first, and to move towards Syria afterwards.\nAmir al-mu'minin, however, said that they should be left as they\nwere, that they themselves should first move towards Syria while the\npeople of Nahrawan could be dealt with afterwards. People said that\nthey were prepared to obey every order of his with all their might\nwhether he moved this way or that way. The army had not moved when\nnews about the rebellion of Kharijites began to reach, and it was\nlearnt that they had butchered the governor of Nahrawan namely\n`Abdullah ibn Khabbab ibn al-Aratt and his slave maid with the\nchild in her womb, and have killed three women of Banu Tayyi and Umm\nSinan as-Saydawiyyah. Amir al-mu'minin sent al-Harith ibn Murrah\nal-`Abdi for investigation but he too was killed by them. When\ntheir rebellion reached this stage it was necessary to deal with\nthem. Consequently, the army turned towards Nahrawan. On reaching\nthere Amir al-mu'minin sent them word that those who had killed\n`Abdullah ibn Khabbab ibn al-Aratt and innocent women should be\nhanded over to him for avenging blood. Those people replied that\nthey had killed these persons jointly and that they considered it\nlawful to shed the blood of all the people on his side. Even at this\nAmir al-mu'minin did not take the initiative for the battle, but\nsent Abu Ayyub al-Ansari with a message of peace. So he spoke to\nthem aloud, \"Whoever comes under this banner or separates from that\nparty and goes to Kufah or al-Mada'in would get amnesty and he\nwould not be questioned. As a result of this Farwah ibn Nawfal\nal-Ashja'i said that he did not know why they were at war with Amir\nal-mu'minin. Saying this he separated along with five hundred men.\nSimilarly group after group began to separate and some of them\njoined Amir al-mu'minin. Those who remained numbered four thousand,\nand according to at-Tabari's account they numbered two thousand\neight hundred. These people were not in any way prepared to listen\nto the voice of truth, and were ready to kill or be killed. Amir\nal-mu'minin had stopped his men to take the initiative but the\nKharijites put arrows in their bows and broke and threw away the\nsheathes of their swords. Even at this juncture Amir al-mu'minin\nwarned them of the dire consequences of war and this sermon is about\nthat warning and admonition. But they were so brimming with\nenthusiasm that they leapt on Amir al-mu'minin's force all of a\nsudden. This onslaught was so severe that the foot men lost ground\nbut they soon fixed themselves firmly that the attack of arrows and\nspears could not dislodge them from their position and they soon so\ncleared away the Kharijites that except for nine persons who fled\naway to save their lives not a single person was left alive. From\nAmir al-mu'minin's army only eight persons fell as martyrs.

On receipt of this order he\nmoved on and overtook him on the coast of the Persian gulf where\nal-Khirrit had by persuasion secured the co-operation of the people\nand enlisting men from here and there, had collected a considerable\nforce. When Ma`qil reached there, he raised the flag of peace and\nannounced that those who had collected from here and there should\nget away. They would not be molested. The effect of this\nannouncement was that save for his own community all others deserted\nhim. He organised those very men and commenced the battle but\nvalorous combatants of Basrah and Kufah displayed such excellent use\nof swords that in a short time one hundred and seventy men of the\ninsurgents were killed while an-Nu`man ibn Suhban ar-Rasib'i\nencountered al-Khirrit (ibn Rashid an-Naji) and eventually felled\nhim and killed him. Soon upon his fall the enemy lost ground and\nthey fled away from the battlefield. Thereafter Ma`qil collected\nall the men, women and children from their camps at one place. From\namong them those who were Muslims were released after swearing of\nallegiance. Those who had turned heretics were called upon to resume\nIslam. Consequently except one old Christian all others secured\nrelease by accepting Islam and this old man was killed. Then he took\nwith him those Christians of Bani Najiyah who had taken part in this\nrevolt together with their families. When Ma`qil reached Ardashir\nKhurrah (a city of Iran) these prisoners wailed and cried, before\nits governor Masqalah ibn Hubayrah ash-Shaybani and beseeched\nhumiliatively to do something for their release. Masqalah sent word\nto Ma`qil through Dhuhl ibn al-Harith to sell these prisoners to\nhim. Ma`qil agreed and sold those prisoners to him for five hundred\nthousand Dirhams and told him to dispatch the price immediately to\nAmir al-mu'minin. He said that he was sending the first instalment\nat once and the remaining instalments would also be sent soon. When\nMa`qil met Amir al-mu'minin he related the whole event before him.\nAmir al-mu'minin ratified this action and waited for the price for\nsome time, but Masqalah observed such deep silence as if nothing was\ndue from him. At last Amir al-mu'minin sent a messenger to him and\nsent him word to either send the price or to come himself. On Amir\nal-mu'minin's order he came to Kufah and on demand of the price\npaid two hundred thousand Dirhams but to evade the balance went away\nto Mu`awiyah's who made him the governor of Tabarastan. When Amir\nal-mu'minin came to know all this he spoke these words (as in this\nsermon). Its sum total is that, \"If he had stayed we would have\nbeen considerate to him in demanding the price and would have waited\nfor improvement of his financial condition, but he fled away like\nslaves after displaying a showy act. Talk about his high\nperseverance had just started when people began to discuss his\nbaseless and lowliness.\"]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-44","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 44"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2.sermons:44.

And there were those who excelled even Kharijites in\nholding and calling Amir al-mu'minin bad. So those who are\nthemselves in the wrong have no right to fight others in the wrong.\nAgain, those who are wilfully in the wrong can be allowed to fight\nthose who are in the wrong by mistake. Thus, Amir al-mu'minin's\nwords make this fact clear that the misguidance of Kharijites was\nnot wilful but under Satan's influence. They mistook wrong as right\nand stuck to it. On the other hand, the position of misguidance of\nMu`awiyah and his party was that they rejected right realising it\nas right and appropriated wrong as the code of their conduct fully\nknowing that it was wrong. Their audacity in the matter of religion\nreached the stage that it can neither be regarded as a result of\nmisunderstanding nor can it be covered under the garb of error of\njudgement, because they openly transgressed the limits of religion\nand paid no heed to the Prophet's injunctions in comparison with\ntheir own view. Thus, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written (vol. 5, p. 130)\nthat when the Prophet's companion Abu'd-Darda' saw utensils of\ngold and silver being used by Mu`awiyah he said he had heard the\nProphet saying, \"One who drinks in vessels of gold and silver will\nfeel flames of the fire of Hell in his stomach\" whereupon\nMu`awiyah said, \"As for me, l do not find any harm in it.\"\nSimilarly, creating Ziyad ibn Abih's blood relationship with\nhimself by his own opinion in total disregard of the Prophet's\ninjunction, abusing the descendants of the Prophet over the pulpit,\ntransgressing the limits of shari`ah, shedding blood of innocent\npersons and placing over Muslims (as so called Khalifah) a vicious\nindividual and thus opening the way to disbelief and atheism are\nevents that to attribute them to any misunderstanding is like\nwilfully closing eyes to facts.]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-61","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 61"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2.sermons:61.

If `Uthman's open misdeeds had not\ngiven a chance to the Muslims to wake up and open their eyes there\nwould have been no question of allegiance to Amir al-mu'minin and\ntemporal authority would have retained the same course as it had so\nfar followed. But all those who could be named for the purpose had\nno courage to come forward because of their own shortcomings while\nMu`awiyah was sitting in his capital away from the centre. In these\ncircumstances there was none except Amir al-mu'minin who could be\nlooked at. Consequently people's eyes hovered around him and the\nsame common people who, following the direction of the wind, had\nbeen swearing allegiance to others jumped at him for swearing\nallegiance. Nevertheless, this allegiance was not on the count that\nthey regarded his Caliphate as from Allah and him as an Imam (Divine\nLeader) to obey whom was obligatory. It was rather under their own\nprinciples which were known as democratic or consultative. However,\nthere was one group who was swearing allegiance to him as a\nreligious obligation regarding his Caliphate as determined by Allah.\nOtherwise, the majority regarded him a ruler like the other Caliphs,\nand as regards precedence, on the fourth position, or at the level\nof the common men after the three caliphs.

Consequently, people from the suburbs of\nKufah began arriving there in large numbers, till they exceeded\neighty thousand. First of all, Amir al-mu'minin sent a vanguard\ncontingent, eight thousand strong, under Ziyad ibn an-Nadr\nal-Harithi and another of four thousand strong under Shurayh ibn\nHani al-Harithi towards Syria. After the departure of this vanguard\ncontingent he himself set out for Syria at the head of the remaining\narmy on Wednesday the 5th of Shawwal. When he was out of the\nboundary of Kufah he offered zuhr (noon) prayer and after staying at\nDayr Abi Musa, Nahr (river) Nars, Qubbat Qubbin, Babil, Dayr Ka`b,\nKarbala', Sabat, Bahurasini, al-Anbar and al-Jazirah arrived at\nar-Riqqah. The people of this place were in favour of `Uthman, and\nat this very place Simak ibn Makhtamah al-Asadi was putting up with\nhis eight hundred men. These people had left Kufah to join\nMu`awiyah after deserting Amir al-mu'minin; when they had seen\nAmir al-mu'minin's force they had dismantled the bridge over the\nRiver Euphrates so that Amir al-mu'minin's army should not cross\nover to the other side of the River. But at the threatening of Malik\nibn al-Harith al-Ashtar an-Nakha`i they were frightened, and after\nconsultations among themselves they put the bridge together again\nand Amir al-mu'minin passed over it with his army. When he alighted\non the other side of the River he saw that Ziyad and Shurayh were\nalso putting up there along with their men since both of them had\nadopted the land route. When, on reaching here, they found that\nMu`awiyah was advancing with his armies towards the Euphrates and\nthinking that they would not be able to face him, they stopped there\nwaiting for Amir al-mu'minin. When they had given the reason for\ntheir stopping there, Amir al-mu'minin accepted their plea and sent\nthem forward. When they reached Sur ar-Rum they found that Abu\nal-A`war as-Sulami was camping there with his army. Both of them\ninformed Amir al-mu'minin of this, whereupon he despatched Ma1ik\nibn al-Harith al-Ashtar an-Nakha`i in their wake as the Officer in\nCommand and cautioned him not to initiate the fighting but to try to\ncounsel them and apprise them of the correct position as far as\npossible. In this way, on reaching there Malik al-Ashtar encamped a\nlittle distance away. Fighting could have commenced any moment, but\nhe did not interfere with the other side nor did he take any step by\nwhich fighting could have been commenced. But Abu al-A`war suddenly\nattacked them at night, whereupon they took their swords out of the\nsheaths and prepared to repulse them. Clashes between the two sides\nwent on for sometime but in the end, taking benefit of the darkness\nof night Abu al-A`war fled away. Since fighting had already\ncommenced, soon after the appearance of dawn an Iraqi commander,\nHashim ibn `Utbah al-Mirqal az-Zuhri, took his position in the\nbattlefield. From the other side also a contingent came to face him,\nand the flames of fighting rose high. At last Malik al-Ashtar\nchallenged Abu al-A`war to fight him, but he did not dare to face\nhim, and towards the evening Malik al-Ashtar went onwards with his\nmen. The next day Amir al-mu'minin reached there with his force and\nset off for Siffin with the vanguard contingent and other forces.\nMu`awiyah had already reached there and had set up his bases. He\nhad also placed a guard on the Euphrates and had occupied it. On\nreaching there Amir al-mu'minin sent him word to remove the guard\nfrom Euphrates, but he refused, whereupon the Iraqis took out their\nswords and in a courageous attack captured the Euphrates. When this\nstage was over Amir al-mu'minin sent Bashir ibn `Amr al-Ansari,\nSa`id ibn Qays al-Hamdani and Shabath ibn Rib`i at-Tamimi to\nMu`awiyah to apprise him of the consequences of war and to make him\nagree to settlement and allegiance. But his reply was that they\ncould not by any means let `Uthman's blood remain neglected, and\nthat now the sword alone would arbitrate between them. Consequently\nin the month of Dhi'l-hijjah 36 A.H. both the parties decided on\nwar and warriors from each side came out into the field to face\ntheir adversary. Those who entered the battlefield from Amir\nal-mu'minin's side were: Hujr ibn `Adi al-Kindi, Shabath ibn\nRib`i at-Tamimi, Khalid ibn al-Mu`ammar, Ziyad ibn an-Nadr\nal-Harithi, Ziyad ibn Khasafah at-Taymi, Sa`id ibn Qays al-Hamdani,\nQays ibn Sa`d al-Ansari and Malik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar\nan-Nakha`i while from the Syrians there were, `Abd ar-Rahman ibn\nKhalid ibn Walid al-Makhzuni, Abu al-A`war as-Sulami, Habib ibn\nMaslamah al-Fihri, `Abdallah ibn Dhi'l-Kala` al-Himyari,\n`Ubaydallah ibn `Umar ibn al-Khattab, Shurahbil ibn Simt al-Kindi,\nand Hamzah ibn Malik al-Hamdani. When the month of Dhi'l-hijjah\ncame to end the fighting had to be stopped for Muharram, but from\nthe first of Safar fighting was resumed and both parties arrayed\nthemselves opposite each other, equipped with swords, spears and\nother weapons. On Amir al-mu'minin's side Malik al-Ashtar was in\ncommand of the horsemen and `Ammar ibn Yasir of the foot soldiers\nof Kufah while Sahl ibn Hunayf al-Ansari was in command of the\nhorsemen and Qays ibn Sa`d of the foot soldiers of Basrah. The\nbanner of the army was given to Hashim ibn `Utbah. In the army of\nthe Syrians on the right hand contingent Ibn Dhi'l-Kala` was in\ncommand, while on the left hand contingent Habib ibn Maslamah, on\nhorsemen `Amr ibn al-`As and on foot soldiers ad-Dahhak ibn Qays\nal-Fihri were in command."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nOn the first day Malik ibn al-Ashtar entered the battle-field with\nhis men, and from the other side Habib ibn Maslamah came out with\nhis men to face him and from both sides a fierce battle ensued.\nThroughout the day swords clashed with swords and spears with\nspears."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNext day, Hashim ibn `Utbah came out with `Ali's army and from\nthe other side Abu al-A`war with his footmen came to face him.

Let whoever kills the other be the ruler.\" Whereupon `Amr\nibn al-`As said to Mu`awiyah: \"`Ali is right. Gather up a little\ncourage and face him. Mu`awiyah replied: \"l am not prepared to\nwaste my life ar your taunting.\" Saying this he went back. When\nAmir al-mu'minin saw him retreating he smiled and himself too\nreturned. The daring with which Amir al-mu'minin led the attacks in\nSiffin can only be called a miraculous feat. Thus, whenever he came\nout challenging in the battlefield, the enemy lines were dispersed\ninto utter disarray and confusion, and even courageous combatants\nhesitated to appear against him. That is why on a few occasions he\ncame onto the battlefield in changed dress so that the enemy should\nnot recognise him and someone should be prepared to engage with him\npersonally. Once `Arar ibn Ad'ham came from the other side to\nengage with al-`Abbas ibn Rabi`ah al-Harith ibn `Abd al-Muttalib.\nThey remained engaged but neither could defeat the other, until\nal-`Abbas chanced to see that a link of his adversary's armour was\nloose.

Then\nwith true aim he gave such a blow that his sword went straight into\nhis bosom. Seeing this, people raised the call of takbir. Mu`awiyah\nwas startled at this noise and on coming to know that `Arar ibn\nAd'ham had been slain he was much disturbed and shouted if there\nwas anyone to take revenge for `Arar ibn Ad'ham and kill\nal-`Abbas, whereupon some tired swordsmen of the tribe of Lakhm\ncame out challenging al-`Abbas. Al-`Abbas said he would come after\ntaking his Chief's permission. Saying al-`Abbas came to Amir\nal-mu'minin to seek permission. Amir al-mu'minin detained him, put\non al-`Abbas's dress. and riding on al-`Abbas's horse entered\nthe battlefield.

In the centre was Amir al-mu'minin himself. On the\nother side Habib ibn Maslamah commanded the Syrian army. When both\nthe lines had come face to face with each other, the valiant\nsoldiers drew out their swords and pounced upon one another like\nferocious lions, and fighting raged on all sides. The banner of the\nright wing Amir al-mu'minin's army was revolving in the hands of\nBanu Hamdan. Whenever anyone of them fell, martyred, someone else\nwould pick up the banner. First of all Kurayb ibn Shurayh raised the\nbanner, on his fall Shurahbil ibn Shurayh took it up, then Marthad\nibn Shurayh, then Hubayrah ibn Shurayh then Yarim ibn Shurayh, then\nSumayr ibn Shurayh and after the killing of all these six brothers\nthe banner was taken up by Sufyan, then `Abd, then Kurayb, the\nthree sons of Zayd, who all fell martyred. After that the banner was\nlifted by two brothers (sons) of Bashir namely `Umayr and al-Harith\nand when they too fell martyred, Wahb ibn Kurayb took up the banner.\nOn this day the enemy's greater attention was on the right wing and\nits assaults were so fierce that the men lost ground and began to\nretreat from the battlefield. Only three hundred men remained with\nthe Officer in Command `Abdullah ibn Budayl. On seeing this Amir\nal-mu'minin asked Malik al-Ashtar to call them back and challenge\nthem as to where they were fleeing. \"If the days of life are over\nthey cannot avoid death by running away.\" Now the defeat of the\nright wing could not be without effect on the left wing, so Amir\nal-mu'minin turned to the left wing and advanced forward, forcing\nthrough the enemy lines, whereupon a slave of Banu Umayyah named\nAhmar said to him, \"Allah may make me die if I fail to slay you\ntoday.\" On hearing this Amir al-mu'minin's slave Kaysan leapt\nover him but was killed by him. When Amir al-mu'minin saw this he\ncaught him by the skirt of his armour and, picking him up, threw him\ndown so forcefully that all his joints were smashed, whereupon Imam\nHasan (p.b.u.h.) and Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah came forward and\ndespatched him to Hell. Meanwhile, after having been called to Malik\nal-Ashtar and his having made them feel ashamed, the retreaters came\nback and again assaulted so steadfastly that pushing back the enemy\nthey reached the place where `Abdullah ibn Budayl was surrounded by\nthe enemy. When he saw his own men he picked up courage and leapt\ntowards Mu`awiyah's tent with drawn sword. Malik al-Ashtar tried\nto stop him but he couldn't, and, killing seven Syrians, he reached\nthe tent of Mu`awiyah. When Mu`awiyah noticed him close by he\nordered him to be stoned, as a result of which he was overpowered\nand the Syrians crowded over him and killed him. When Malik\nal-Ashtar saw this he proceeded forward with the combatants of Banu\nHamdan and Banu Madh'hij for an attack on Mu`awiyah, and began\ndispersing the contingent on guard around him. When, out of the five\ncircles of his guards only one remained to be dispersed, Mu`awiyah\nput his foot in the stirrup of his horse in order to run away, but\non someone's encouragement again stopped. On another side of the\nbattlefield a tumult was raging from one end to the other by the\nswords of `Ammar ibn Yasir and Hashim ibn `Utbah. From whatever\nside `Ammar passed, the companions (of the Holy Prophet) flocked\naround him and then made such a joint assault that destruction\nspread throughout the enemy lines. When Mu`awiyah saw them\nadvancing he threw his fresh forces towards them. But he continued\ndisplaying the excellence of his bravery under the storm of swords\nand spears. At last Abu al-`Adiyah al-Juhani hit him with a spear\nfrom which he could not balance himself and then Ibn Hawiy (Jawn\nas-Saksiki) came forward and slew him. `Ammar ibn Yasir's death\ncaused tumult in Mu`awiyah's ranks because about him they had\nheard the Holy Prophet (S) having said: \" `Ammar will be killed at\nthe hands of a rebellious party.\" Thus before he fell as martyr\nDhu'l-Kala` had said to `Amr ibn al-`As: \"I see `Ammar on\n`Ali's side; are we that rebellious party?\" `Amr ibn al-`As had\nassured him that eventually `Ammar would join them, but when he\nkilled fighting on `Ali's side the rebellious party stood exposed\nand no scope was left for any other interpretation. Nevertheless\nMu`awiyah started telling the Syrians that: \"We did not kill\n`Ammar, but `Ali did it because he brought him to the\nbattlefield.\" When Amir al-mu'minin heard this cunning sentence he\nremarked: \"In that case the Holy Prophet (S) killed Hamzah as he\nhad brought him to the battlefield of Uhud.\" Hashim ibn `Utbah\nalso fell in this conflict.

Now Chingiz Khan lost all patience and his eyes filled with\nblood. He rose with his sword in hand, and the Tartar warriors leapt\ntowards Bukhara on their speedy stallions. `Alau'd-Din came out\nwith four hundred thousand combatants to face him but could not\nresist the incessant assaults of the Tartars, and having been\nvanquished only after a few attacks ran away to Nishabur across the\nriver Jaxartes (Sihun). The Tartars smashed Bukhara and razed it to\nthe ground. They pulled down schools and mosques, burning to ashes\nthe houses and killing men and women without distinction.

No city escaped their\nruining and no populace could avoid their trampling. Wherever they\nwent they upset the kingdom, overthrew governments, and in a short\ntime established their authority over the northern portion of Asia.\nWhen Chingiz Khan died in 622 A.H. his own son Ogedei Khan succeeded\nhim.

He therefore led an assault on\nKhurasan, and the Hanafite, thinking themselves to be safe from the\nTartars, opened the city gates for them. But the Tartars did not\nmake any distinction between Hanafite and Shafi`ite and killed\nwhoever fell to their hands. After killing most of its population\nthey took it in occupation. These very differences between the\nHanafite and the Shafi`ite opened for him the door of conquest upto\nIraq. Consequently, after conquering Khurasan his courage increased\nand in 656 A.H. he marched on Baghdad with two hundred thousand\nTartars. Al-Musta`sim Billah's army and the people of Baghdad\njointly faced them, but it was not in their power to stop this\ntorrent of calamity. The result was that the Tartars entered Baghdad\non the day of `Ashura' carrying with them bloodshed and ruin. They\nremained busy in killing for forty days. Rivers of blood flowed in\nthe streets and all the alleys were filled with dead bodies. Hundred\nof thousands of people were put to the sword while al-Musta`sim\nBillah was trampled to death under foot.

The aim in this is not\nto exhibit his correctness of thinking and judgement or deep\nsagacity but to show that there was unity and concord between him\nand the Caliphs so that attention should not be paid to the fact\nthat in some matters they also differed and that mutual clashes had\nalso occurred. History shows that Amir al-mu'minin did have\ndifferences of principles with the Caliphs and did not approve every\nstep of theirs. In the sermon of ash-Shiqshiqiyyah he has expressed\nin loud words his difference of opinion and anger about each regime.\nNevertheless, this difference does not mean that correct guidance\nshould be withheld in collective Islamic problems. Again, Amir\nal-mu'minin's character was so high that no one could imagine that\nhe would ever evade giving counsel which concerned the common weal,\nor would give such counsel which would damage public interests. That\nis why, despite differences of principle, he was consulted. This\nthrows light on the greatness of his character and the correctness\nof his thinking and judgement. Similarly, it is a prominent trait of\nthe Holy Prophet's character that despite rejecting his claim to\nprophethood the unbelievers acknowledged him the best trustee and\ncould never doubt his trustworthiness. Rather, even during clashes\nof mutual opposition they entrusted to him their property without\nfear and never suspected that their property would be\nmisappropriated. Similarly, Amir al-mu'minin was held to occupy so\nhigh a position of trust and confidence that friend and foe both\ntrusted in the correctness of his counsel. So, just as the\nProphet's conduct shows his height of trustworthiness, and just as\nit cannot be inferred from it that there was mutual accord between\nhim and the unbelievers, because trust has its own place while the\nclash of Islam and unbelief has another, in the same way, despite\nhaving differences with the Caliphs, Amir al-mu'minin was regarded\nas the protector of national and community interests and as the\nguardian of Islam's wellbeing and prosperity. Thus when national\ninterests were involved he was consulted and he tendered his\nunbiased advice raising himself above personal ends and keeping in\nview the Prophet's tradition to the effect that \"He who is\nconsulted is a trustee\" never allowed any dishonesty or duplicity\nto interfere. When on the occasion of the battle of Palestine, the\nCaliph `Umar consulted him about his taking part in it himself,\nthen, irrespective of whether or not his opinion would accord with\n`Umar's feelings, he kept in view Islam's prestige and existence\nand counselled him to stay in his place and to send to the\nbattlefront such a man who should be experienced and wellversed in\nthe art of fighting, because the going of an inexperienced man would\nhave damaged the established prestige of Islam and the awe in which\nthe Muslims were held which had existed from the Prophet's days\nwould have vanished. In fact, in the Caliph `Umar's going there\nAmir al-mu'minin saw signs of defeat and vanquishment. He therefore\nfound Islam's interest to lie in detaining him and indicated his\nview in the words that:"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n\"If you have to retreat from the battlefield, it would not be your\npersonal defeat only, but the Muslims would lose heart by it and\nleave the battle-field and disperse here and there, because with the\nofficer in command leaving the field the army too would lose ground.\nFurthermore, with the centre being without the Caliph there would be\nno hope of any further assistance from behind which could sustain\ncourage of the combatants.\""},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThis is that counsel which is put forth as a proof of mutual accord\nalthough this advice was tendered in view of Islam's prestige and\nlife which was dearer to Amir al-mu'minin than any other interest.\nNo particular individual's life was dear to him for which he might\nhave advised against participation in the\nbattle.]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-134","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 134"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2.sermons:134.

Thus unless a Self-created Creator is believed in, who\nshould be the cause of all causes, the mind will remain groping in\nthe unending labyrinth of cause and effect, and never attain the\nidea of the last extremity of the series of creation.

Therefore it is necessary to believe\nthat the Creator should be a Being not dependent on any other\ncreator for His own existence, and everything else should be\ndependent on Him. This dependence of the entire creation is a proof\nthat the existence of the Source of all creation is from ever and\neternal.

To believe that He\ncan be seen is to believe that He has body, but since He is not a\nbody, and He does not exist through a body, and He does not lie in\nany direction or place, there is no question of His being seen.

He sees as well as hears, but is not dependent on instruments\nof seeing or hearing, because if He were in need of organs of the\nbody for hearing and seeing He would be in need of external things\nfor His perfection and would not be a perfect Being, whereas He\nshould be perfect in all respects and no attribute of perfection\nshould be apart from His Self."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nTo believe in attributes separately from His Self would mean that\nthere would be a self and a few attributes and the compound of the\nself and the attributes would be Allah.

When the parts exist from\nbefore, how can the whole be from ever and eternal because its\nexistence is later than that of its parts. But Allah had the\nattributes of knowledge, power and sustaining even when nothing was\nexistent, because none of His attributes were created in Him from\noutside, but His attributes are His Self and His Self is His\nattributes. Consequently, His knowledge does not depend on the\nobject of knowledge existing first and then His knowledge, because\nHis Self is prior to things coming into existence.

All these things pained her much and\nnaturally her feelings on such an occasion were that if she had\nborne children they would have been the Prophet's sons and they\nwould have been the pivot of the Prophet's affection instead of\nImam Hasan and Imam Husayn. But she was not gifted with any issue\nand she gratified her own desire to be a mother by adopting the\nsurname Umm `Abdillah (mother of the slave of Allah) after her\nsister's son.

There were\nalso moments when distinction was conferred on Amir al-mu'minin in\npreference to Abu Bakr. For instance, in connection with the\ndispatch of the Qur'anic verses on Bara'ah (innocence), the\nProphet removed Abu Bakr from the job, recalled him and assigned it\nto Amir al-mu'minin saying that he had been commanded by Allah to\ntake it himself or send it through a member of his family.

This was because their far-reaching sight had realised that\nthe only purpose in getting Medina vacated by the muhajirun and the\nansar could be that after the death of the Prophet no one should\nstand in Amir al-mu'minin's way and that he should get the\ncaliphate without any trouble. On receipt of this message the\ncontingent under Usamah came back. When the Prophet learnt this he\nagain ordered Usamah to march with the contingent and even said,\n\"Allah may curse him who keeps away from the contingent,\"\nwhereupon they again set off, but they were again called back till\nthe Prophet's illness assumed serious proportions, but Usamah's\ncontingent did not go out as it did not want to. After this Abu Bakr\nwas sent word through Bilal that he should deputise the Prophet in\nleading the prayers in order to pave the way for his Caliphateship.\nAccordingly, keeping this in view he was first shown as the\nProphet's caliph (deputy) in prayers and eventually was accepted as\nhis caliph for all purposes. Thereafter matters were so contrived\nthat Amir al-mu'minin could not get the Caliphate. However, after\nthe reign of the third caliph circumstances took such a turn that\npeople were obliged to swear allegiance at Amir al-mu'minin's\nhand. On this occasion `A'ishah was present in Mecca. When she\nlearnt about Amir al-mu'minin's caliphate her eyes began emitting\nflames, and rage and anger perturbed her mind, and her hatred for\nAmir al-mu'minin assumed such seriousness that she rose against him\non the excuse of avenging blood of the same man (`Uthman) whom she\nhad herself proclaimed fit to be killed, and openly declared war as\na result of which so much bloodshed occurred that the whole land of\nBasrah was smeared with the blood of those killed, and the door of\ndisunity was opened for good.

If the adoption of a line\nof action which made the whole Islamic world raise hue and cry in\nspite of his having being a companion of the Prophet, having heard\nhis instructions, having seen his behaviour and having been\nacquainted with the commandments of Islam can be regarded as a\ndistinction, then this taunt may also be regarded as praise.

In\nfact, the words about which it is argued that they are in praise are\nenough to prove the seriousness of his crime, because a crime in\nignorance and unawareness is not so serious as the weight given to\nthe seriousness of the commission of a crime despite knowledge and\nawareness. Consequently a person who is unaware of the rise and fall\nof a road and stumbles in the dark night is excusable but a person\nwho is aware of the rise and fall of the road and stumbled in broad\nday light is liable to be blamed.

Before taking this to be a\ndistinction, the real nature of `Uthman's son-in-lawship should be\nseen. History shows that in this matter `Uthman did not enjoy the\ndistinction of being the first, but before him Ruqayyah and Umm\nKulthum had been married to two sons of Abu Lahab namely `Utbah and\n`Utaybah, but despite their being sons-in-law, they have not been\nincluded among people of position of pre-prophethood period. How\nthen can this be regarded as a source of position without any\npersonal merit, when there is no authority about the importance of\nthis relationship, nor was any importance attached to this matter in\nsuch a way that there might have been some competition between\n`Uthman and some other important personality in this regard and\nthat his selection for it might have given him prominence, or that\nthese two girls might have been shown to possess an important\nposition in history, tradition or biography as a result of which\nthis relationship could be given special importance and regarded as\na distinction for him? If the marriage of these two daughters with\n`Utbah and `Utaybah in the pre-prophethood period is held as\nlawful on the ground that marriage with unbelievers had not till\nthen been made unlawful, then in `Uthman's case also the condition\nfor lawfulness was his acceptance of Islam, there is no doubt that\nhe had pronounced the kalimah ash-shahadatayn (there is no god but\nAllah and Muhammad is His Messenger) and had accepted Islam\noutwardly. As such this marriage can be held a proof of his outward\nIslam, but no other honour can be proved through it. Again, it is\nalso not agreed that these two were the real daughters of the\nMessenger of Allah, because there is one group which denies them to\nbe his real daughters, and regards them as being the daughters of\nKhadijah's sister Halah, or the daughters of her own previous\nhusband.

To ignore the clear import\nof the words and to interpret them in a way which does not suit the\noccasion, does not exhibit a correct spirit, when from the context\nalso the same meaning accrues which the words openly convey. Thus,\nit is to give a warning about the Umayyad's mischief that Amir\nal-mu'minin uttered the words: \"'Ask me whatever you like';\nbecause I know the paths and courses of divine destiny more than the\npassages of the earth.

They would\neat only if a casual traveller or the inhabitant of nearby dwellings\ngave them anything to eat, otherwise they remained contented with\nthe fruits of wild trees and the water of the streams, and thus they\npassed their life. This way of worship commenced in a way that was\nforced by the oppression and hardships of rulers. Certain people\nleft their houses and, in order to avoid their grip, hid themselves\nin some wilderness or cave in a mountain, engaging themselves in\nworship of and devotion to Allah. Later on, this forced asceticism\nacquired a voluntary form and people began to retire to caves and\nhollows of their own volition. Thus it became an accepted way that\nwhoever aimed at spiritual development retired to some corner after\nsevering himself from all worldly ties.

The conception of worship in Islam is not confined to a\nfew particular rites, but it regards the earning of one's\nlivelihood through lawful means, mutual sympathy and good behaviour,\nand co-operation and assistance also to be important constituents of\nworship. If an individual ignores worldly rights and obligations and\ndoes not fulfil his responsibility towards his wife and children,\nnor occupies himself in efforts to earn a livelihood, but all the\ntime stays in meditation, he ruins his life and does not fulfil the\npurpose of living. If this were Allah's aim, what would have the\nneed for creating and populating the world when there was already a\ncategory of creatures who were all the time engaged in worshipping\nand adoration."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNature has made man to stand on the cross-roads at which the midway\nis the centre of guidance.

That midway is that he should neither bend\ntowards this world to such an extent as to ignore the next life,\ndevoting himself entirely to this one, nor should he abstain from\nthis world so as not to have any connection with anything of it,\nconfining himself to some corner leaving everything else. Since\nAllah has created man in this world he should follow the code of\nlife for living in this world, and should partake of the comforts\nand pleasures bestowed by Allah within moderate limits. The eating\nand using of things made lawful by Allah is not against Allah's\nworship, but rather Allah has created these things for the very\npurpose that they should be taken advantage of. That is why those\nwho were the chosen of Allah lived in this world with others and ate\nand drank like others. They did not feel the need to turn their\nfaces away from the people of the world, and to adopt the wilderness\nor the caves of mountains as their abodes, or to live in distant\nspots. On the other hand they remembered Allah, remained\ndisentangled from worldly affairs, and did not forget death despite\nthe pleasures and comforts of life."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe life of asceticism sometimes produces such evils as ruin the\nnext life also as well as this one, and such an individual proves to\nbe the true picture of \"the looser in this life as well as the\nnext.\" When natural impulses are not satisfied in the lawful and\nlegal way the mind turns into a centre of evil-ideas and becomes\nincapable of performing worship with peace and concentration; and\nsometimes passions so overcome the ascetic that breaking all moral\nfetters, he devotes himself completely to their satisfaction and\nconsequently falls in an abyss of ruin for which it is impossible to\nextract himself. That is why religious law accords a greater\nposition to the worship performed by a family man than that by a\nnon-family man, because the former can exercise mental peace and\nconcentration in the worship and rituals."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIndividuals who put on the cloak of Sufism and make a loud show of\ntheir spiritual greatness are cut off from the path of Islam and are\nignorant of its wide teachings. They have been misled by Satan and,\nrelying on their self-formed conceptions, tread wrongful paths.\nEventually their misguidance becomes so serious that they begin to\nregard their leaders as having attained such a level that their word\nis as the word of Allah and their act is as the act of Allah.\nSometimes they regard themselves beyond all the bounds and\nlimitations of religious law and consider every evil act to be\nlawful for them. This deviation from faith and irreligiousness is\nnamed Sufism (complete devotion to Allah). Its unlawful principles\nare called \"at-tariqah\" (ways of achieving communion with Allah)\nand the followers of this cult are known as Sufis. First of all Abu\nHashim al-Kufi and Shami adopted this nickname. He was of Umayyad\ndescent and a fatalist (believing that man is bound to act as\npre-ordained by Allah). The reason for giving him this name was\nthat, in order to make a show of his asceticism and fear for Allah,\nhe put on a woollen cloak. Later on this nickname became common and\nvarious grounds were put forth as the basis of this name. For\nexample, one ground is that 'Sufi' has three letters, \"sad\",\n\"waw\" and \"fa'\". \"sad\" stands for \"sabr\" (endurance),\n\"sidq\" (truthfulness) and \"safa\" (purity of heart); \"waw\"\nstands for \"wudd\" (love), \"wird\" (repeating Allah's name) and\n\"wafa'\" (faithfulness to Allah), and \"fa'\" stands for \"fard\"\n(unity), \"faqr\" (destitution) and \"fana'\" (death or absorption\nin Allah's Self). The second view is that it has been derived from\n\"as-Suffah\", which was a platform near the Prophet's mosque which\nhad a covering of date-palm leaves. Those who stayed there were\ncalled Ashabu'Suffah (people of the platform). The third view is\nthat the name of the progenitor of an Arab tribe was Sufah, and this\ntribe performed the duties of serving the pilgrims and the Ka`bah,\nand it is with reference to their connection with this tribe that\nthese people were called Sufis. This group is divided among various\nsects but the basic sects are seven only.\\\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ol","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"al-Wahdatiyyah (unitarian):"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThis sect believes in the oneness of all existence.

In these circumstances when al-Mughirah tried to play this\ntrick Amir al-mu'minin said just by way of relating a fact that\n`Umar achieved the good (of this world) and remained safe from its\nevil.

Rather,\nfrom this tradition it is evidently shown that these words were\nuttered by Ibnah Abi Hathmah. Allah alone knows on what ground the\nwords of Ibnah Abi Hathmah are quoted and then it is daringly argued\nthat these words were uttered by Amir al-mu'minin about `Umar. It\nseems Amir al-mu'minin had uttered these words about someone on\nsome occasion, then Ibnah Abi Hathmah used similar words on\n`Umar's death and then even Amir al-mu'minin's words were taken\nto be in praise of `Umar. Otherwise, no mind except a mad one can\nargue that the words uttered by Ibnah Abi Hathmah should be deemed a\nground to hold that Amir al-mu'minin said these words in praise of\n`Umar. Can it be expected, after (a glance at) the sermon of the\nCamel's Foam, that Amir al-mu'minin might have uttered these\nwords. Again, it is worth consideration that if these words had been\nuttered by Amir al-mu'minin on `Umar's death, then at the\nConsultative Committee when he refused to follow the conduct of the\n(first) two Caliphs it should have been said to him that only the\nother day he has said that `Umar had established the sunnah and\nbanished innovations, so that when his conduct was in accord with\nthe sunnah what was the sense in accepting the sunnah but refusing\nto follow his conduct.]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-227","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 227"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2.sermons:227.

For him, this period was of the severest oppression\nand destitution. The unbelievers of the Quraysh had closed all the\ndoors of livelihood upon him, and had left no deficiency in\ninflicting hardships upon him, so much so that in order to take his\nlife they began contriving how to do away with him. Forty of their\nnobles assembled in the hall of audience (Dar an-Nadwah) for\nconsultation, and decided that one individual should be picked out\nfrom every tribe and they should jointly attack him. In this way,\nBanu Hashim would not dare to face all the tribes, and the matter\nwould quieten down on the payment of blood price. To give a\npractical shape to this scheme, these people sat in ambush near the\nhouse of the Prophet on the night of the first of Rabi` al-awwal,\nso that when the prophet slept in his bed he would be attacked. On\nthis side the preparation for killing him was complete, and on the\nother side Allah informed him of all the intrigues of the Quraysh\nunbelievers and commanded him to make `Ali (p.b.u.h.) sleep on his\nbed and himself to emigrate to Medina. The Prophet sent for `Ali\n(p.b.u.h.) and disclosing to him his plan, said: \"Ali, you lie on\nmy bed.\" Amir al-mu'minin enquired: \"O' Messenger of Allah, will\nyour life be saved by my sleeping here?\" The Prophet said: \"Yes.\"\nHearing this Amir al-mu'minin performed a prostration in\nthanks-giving and, exposing himself fully to the danger, lay on the\nProphet's bed while the Prophet left from the rear door. The\nQuraysh unbelievers were peeping and getting ready for the attack\nbut Abu Lahab said: \"It is not proper to attack in the night\nbecause there are women and children also in the house. When morning\ndawns you attack him, but keep watch during night that he should not\nmove anywhere.\" Consequently, they kept their eyes on the bed\nthroughout the night and soon, on the appearance of the dawn,\nproceeded forward stealthily. Hearing the sound of their footsteps,\nAmir al-mu'minin removed the covering from his face and stood up.\nThe Quraysh gazed at him with stretched eyes as to whether it was an\nillusion or fact. After making sure that it was `Ali they enquired,\n\"Where is Muhammad?\" and `Ali replied, \"Did you entrust him to\nme, that now you are asking me?\" They had no reply to this. Men ran\nto chase him but found footprints only up to the cave of Thawr.\nBeyond that there were neither footprints nor any sign of hiding in\nthe cave. They came back bewildered while the Prophet after staying\nin the cave for three days left for Medina. Amir al-mu'minin passed\nthese three days in Mecca, returned to the people their properties\nlying in trust with the Prophet and set off towards Medina to join\nthe Prophet. Upto al-`Arj which is a place between Mecca and\nMedina, he kept getting news about the Prophet and he continued his\nanxious march in his search till he met the Prophet at Quba on the\ntwelfth of Rabi` al-awwal, and entered Medina with him.

It was a very rough and hard place to live in, and we were\nforced to lead a very harsh life. Their instigated their tribe as well as other clans to fight\nagainst us. The Merciful Allah came to our help.

From amongst the Quraysh, the condition\nof those who had embraced Islam, was not as bad as ours.\nEither they had defensive alliance with the non-believers or some tribes decided to defend\nthem despite their differences in religion. While it was the practice of the Holy Prophet (s)\nthat whenever a battle was raged and his companions behaved cowardly or ran away from the\nbattlefield (as in Badr, Uhud and Hunayn) which was usually the case or started making the\nMuslims nervous (as in Khandaq), he sent members of his family (Bani Hashim) to fight out\nthe battle to protect his companions.\nThese members of Bani Hashim often fought single handed and some even met martyrdom as\nfor instance, Ubayda bin Haarith was killed in the Battle of Badr, Hamza bin Abdul Muttalib\nin Uhud and Ja'far bin Abu Taalib in the Battle of Mu'tah. Besides these three, there was\nanother person (here Imam Ali (a) meant himself) who also tried his best to meet martyrdom.\nI could name him but the date of his death had not yet approached and he passed through\nthese terrible ordeals alive.\nO time!

It was not to be a regime whose officers had an upper hand and were fattened on\npublic money. It was to be a regime where the governed and the tax-payers were at premium.\nIt was their convenience for which the State was to function.\nIt was a welfare-state working solely for the welfare of the people living under its rule, a\nregime where the rich cannot get richer while the poor are made poorer; a regime where\ncanons of religion hold the balance between the governed and the ruler.\nDo not give up fearing Allah who has no partner. Do not let the Muslim grieve (over their lot\nof having you as their ruler) and do not approach them in a way as to make your approach\nhateful to them. Do not tax them more than what is actually due from them to Allah.\nWhen you reach a group of people (tribe or village) to assess a tax on them, then stay only at\ntheir watering-place (a well or water-hole the most convenient place for stay in desert\nregions) and do not stay in their houses. Then go to them maintaining your dignity and\nprestige and when you are in their midst, wish them peace and blessings of Allah and show\ndue respect to them. Tell them that the Caliph of Allah has sent you to collect from them their\ndues to Allah.\nAsk them whether they possess enough means to pay the dues of Allah that you may gather\nthem and pass them on to His Caliph. If somebody tells you that he does not possess enough\nwealth to make him liable to pay taxes then do not worry him and accept his plea. If someone\ntells you that he is in a position to pay Zakat, then go with him to his house, field or pasture\n(because Zakat was then collected in coins as well as in kind).\nBut do not frighten him or make him nervous and do not behave with them with undue\nharshness or tyranny. Then accept the gold or silver which he offers.\n(Here are the instructions regarding the number of cattle to be assessed for Zakat). If he has\ncows, bulls, goats and camels then do not enter the herd without his permission because most\nof it belongs to him (it is not part of Zakat). If you have to enter the herd then do not enter like\nthe one who is coming there to take possession of the cattle. Do not tyrannize the owner, do\nnot frighten the cattle so as to make them disperse. Do not make the owner feel anxious or\nsorry for them. Then divide the herd into two parts and allow the owner to select the one for\nhimself. If he selects one part for keeping himself, then do not object to it.\nAgain divide the part which he has left for the share of Zakat to be selected from out of these\ntwo parts, again allow him to select the lot which he wants to retain for himself. Never object\nto his selection (because it is the assessor who is dividing them in equal lots; therefore, the\nselection between the two lots should naturally rest with the owner). Continue like that until\nyou arrive at the lot which constitutes the share of Allah (Zakat) then take possession of it.\nEven if, in spite of all these precautions, he thinks the division was unfair and unjust, then\nmix the whole lot and go through the process once again as I have already explained to you\ntill you arrive at the share of Zakat to the satisfaction of everybody concerned. Remember you\nhave not to accept old and diseased camels or such as have their limbs damaged. Entrust this\nlot only to such person who is honest and who can be trusted and who can guard the property\nof the Muslims sympathetically till it reaches their ruler and caliph so that it may be\ndistributed equitably among the Muslims.\nI want to instruct you once again that you should not entrust these goods and animals to\nanyone who is not honest.\nEntrust them to one who is trustworthy and who is of a kind and sympathetic disposition so\nthat he may not treat the animals cruelly and may not starve them or tire them out during the\ntransit.\nInstruct him not to separate a she-camel from its young, not to milk it so much that nothing is\nleft for its young one and not to ride them harshly or to overburden them with heavy loads.\nHe should ride them in turns so that those who have been already ridden may have an easy\njourney. He should not drive them fast and should avoid harshness. He should always give\nthem enough rest at watering places. They should not be driven through deserts. As far as\npossible green lands and well-wooded regions should be selected for the passage.\nThus every care should be taken so that they reach their destination in healthy and robust\ncondition without having received any harsh and brutal treatment on the way so that I may\ndistribute them according to the Orders of Allah and the Holy Prophet (s).

Is it not an irony of fate that\ncircumstances have favoured you to such a position that you dare remind us of the Favours\nwhich Allah bestowed upon us and the Blessings conferred by Him upon His chosen Prophet\n(s) who was one of us. You have nothing to do with them and you have no share in these\nBlessings and Favours.\nYour condition is like that of a man who carries dates to the date-growing districts or that of a\nman who tries to teach archery to the master from whom he has learnt the art. You believe\nthat the best of the people amongst the Muslims are so and so and you have started discussing\na subject (superiority of Muhajirs over Ansar) which if it is proved correct will not be of any\nuse to you, will not enhance your status and if it is repudiated, this repudiation will not harm\nyou because you are neither a Muhajir nor an Ansar.\nWhat have you to do with their respective status and prestige? What is that for you if one is\nconsidered superior to the other? How are you considered in their affairs? You are a freed and\nliberated slave, and slaves and their sons, though freed and liberated, cannot aspire to the\nstatus of Muhajirs and Ansar and they have no right to introduce unholy classification\namongst the Muhajirs and Ansar. Do you realize your limitations? You do not belong to\neither group, you are a liberated slave and son of liberated parents and you want to introduce\nan unhealthy division between these two groups.\nThe false status you have tried to grasp is not going to enhance your prestige (before Allah or\nthe people). Can you not think of remaining at the place where you old hostility towards Islam\nand the Holy Prophet (s) has kept you? How is the lower status or defeat of one class or a\nperson of that class, to whom you do not belong going to harm you and how is the success or\nhigher status of the other going to do you good? You have gone astray from the straight path\nand from the real teachings of Islam. Listen! I want to give you a short description of the\nBlessings of Allah upon us.\nA party of Muhajirs met martyrdom. They were killed in the cause of Islam and Allah.\neveryone of them was blessed by Allah with a status and rank. Out of them those who\nbelonged to my family and tribe, Bani Hashim, were granted an excellent status by Allah.\nHamza (the uncle of the Holy Prophet (s) and Imam Ali (a)) received the title of Chief of\nMartyrs (Sayyid al-Shuhada). The Holy Prophet (s) himself called him by this name after his\nmartyrdom and at his funeral ceremony.\nThe Holy Prophet (s) recited Takbir ('Allahu Akbar') seventy times as a mark of distinction\nfor him, which is not for any other Muslim. Some Muhajirs lost their hands in the battlefield\nbut when one of us (Ja'far, cousin of the Holy Prophet (s) and brother of Imam Ali (a)) lost\nboth of his hands and died in the battlefield, Allah granted him angelic wings and the Holy\nProphet (s) informed us that this martyr received the title of Tayyar (one who flies in\nParadise). If Allah had not disapproved man's habit of eulogizing and praising himself, I\nwould have given several such instances which speak of the enhancement of my prestige and\nstatus before Allah, instances which are accepted and can be testified by faithful Muslims\nabout which the hearers will have no reason to doubt. Do not be like a man whom the Devil\nhas laid astray. Accept the obvious truth when it faces you.\nListen O' Mu'awiya! We (Ahlul Bayt, the progeny of the Holy Prophet (s)) are unique\nexamples of the creation of Allah. For such a status, we are not under obligation to any person\nor tribe but the Almighty Allah who granted us these blessings. Human beings have received\nand will receive perfection through us. The perpetual supremacy and inherent superiority do\nnot prevent us from making contact with human beings or with your clan, we have married\namongst you and have established family connections with your (as well as with others) clan,\nthough you do not belong to our class. How can you be our equal when the Holy Prophet (s)\nbelongs to us and Abu Jahl, the worst enemy of Islam was from amongst you.\nAsadullah (lit. \"the Lion of Allah\" - a title of Imam Ali (a)) is from amongst us, while Asadul\nAhlaaf (lion of the opposing groups, who had sworn to fight against Islam and the Holy\nProphet (s)) was from you.\nThe two foremost leaders of the youth of Paradise (Imam Hasan (a) & Imam Husayn (a)) are\nfrom us and the children of Hell are from you. The best woman in the world (title bestowed\nby Allah upon Fatima (a)) the beloved daughter of the Holy Prophet (s) is from us, and the\nslanderer and the wood-carrying woman who tried to spend every hour of her life in doing\nharm to the Holy Prophet of Islam (s), was your aunt. There are so many other things similar\nto the few mentioned which praise us and speak ill of your clan and which show how far and\nsuperior we are to you.\nWe were faithful followers of the commandments of Allah and you and your clan always\nopposed Islam and accepted it out of sheer expediency simply to save yourselves from\nhumiliation and disgrace.\nOur sincerity in Islam and our services to its cause are the facts of history and history cannot\ndeny your enmity against Islam and the Holy Prophet (s).\nThe credit which you want to take away from us and the honour which you want to deprive us\nof is the one which the Holy Qur'an is carefully guarding for us.

(What a prophecy!)\nLet it be known to you that decay of health, passing away of time and nearness of death, have\nmade me realize that I should give more thought to my future (next world) and to my people;\nadvise them more and spend more time in equipping them mentally to face this world.\nI felt that my own sons and my near ones have as much right to utilize my experiences and\nknowledge, all the ups and downs of life, all the realities and all the truths about life in this\nworld and in the Hereafter, which are as much known to me as others.\nI decided, therefore, to spend more time over you and to prepare you more for your. This was\nneither selfishness nor self-esteem nor any mental luxury of giving away pieces of advice, but\nit was the sincere desire of making you see the world as I found it, look at the realities of lives\nas I looked at them, and do the right thing at the right time and right place as it should be done\nwhich made me write down these exhortations to you.\nYou will not find in them anything but truth and realities.\nMy dear son! You are part of my body and soul and whenever I look at you I feel as if I am\nlooking at myself. If any calamities befalls you, I feel as if it has befallen me. Your death will\nmake me feel as if it was my own death. Your affairs are to me like my own affairs.\nTherefore, I committed these pieces of advice to paper. I want you to take care of them, to pay\nattention to them and to guard them well. I may remain longer in your life or I may not, but I\nwant these pieces of advice to remain with you always.\nMy first and foremost advice to you, my son, is to fear Allah. Be His obedient servant. Keep\nHis thought always fresh in your mind. Be attached to and carefully guard the principles\n(Islam) which connect you with Him. Can any other connection be stronger, more durable and\nmore lasting than this to command greater respect and consideration or to replace it?\nAccept good exhortations and refresh your mind with them. Adopt piety and kill your\ninordinate desires with its help. Build your character with the help of true faith in religion and\nAllah. Subjugate your nature with the vision of death, make it see the mortality of life and of\nall that it holds dear, force it to realize the actuality of misfortunes and adversities, the\nchanges of circumstances and times and compel it to study the lives of past people.\nPersuade it to see the ruined cities, the dilapidated palaces, decaying signs and relics of fallen\nempires of past nations. Then meditate over the activities of those people, what they have all\ndone when they were alive and were in power, what they achieved, from where they started\ntheir careers; where, when and how they were brought to an end, where they are now; what\nhave they actually gained out of life and what was their contributions to the human welfare.\nIf you carefully ponder over these problems, you will find that each one of those people has\nparted company with the others and with all that he cherished and loved and he is now in a\nsolitary abode, alone and unattended; and you also will be like him.\nTake care to provide well for your future abode. Do not barter away eternal blessing for\npleasures of this mortal and fleeting world.\nDo not talk about things which you do not know. Do not speculate about and pass verdicts on\nsubjects about which you are not in a position to form an opinion and are not called upon to\ndo so.\nGive up the way where there is a possibility of your going astray. When there is danger on\nyour wandering in the wilderness of ignorance, possibility of losing the sight of the goal\nwhich you want to attain and of reaching the end aimed at, then it is better to give up the quest\nthan to advance facing uncertain dangers and unforeseen risks.\nAdvise people to do good and to live virtuously because you are fit to give such advice. Let\nyour words and deeds teach the world lessons of how to abstain from wickedness and vicious\ndeeds. Try your best to keep away from those who indulge in vices and sins.\nFight, whenever required, to defend the cause of Allah. When you think of defending the\ncause of Allah do not be afraid that people will laugh at you, censure your action or slander\nyou. Fearlessly and boldly help truth and justice. Bear patiently the sufferings and face\nbravely the obstacles which come in your way when you follow truth and when you try to\nuphold it. Adhere to the cause of truth and justice wherever you find it. Try to be well versed\nwith Islamic Jurisprudence and theology and acquire a thorough knowledge of the canons of\nthis religion.\nDevelop the habit of patience against sufferings, calamities and adversities. This virtue of\npatience is one of the highest values of morality and nobility of character and it is the best\nhabit which one can develop. Trust in Allah and let your mind seek His protection in every\ncalamity and suffering because you will thus entrust yourself and your affairs to the Best\nTrustee and to the Mightiest Guardian. Do not seek help or protection from anybody but\nAllah.\nReserve your prayers, your requests, your solicitations, your supplications, and your entreaties\nto Him and Him alone because to grant, to give, to confer and to bestow, as well as to\nwithhold, to deprive, to refuse, and to debar, lies only in His Power. Ask as much of His\nBlessings and seek as much of His Guidance as you can.\nTry to understand my exhortation, ponder over them deeply; do not take them lightly and do\nnot turn away from them because the best knowledge is that which benefits the listener. The\nknowledge which does not benefit anybody is useless, not valuable and not worth learning\nand remembering.\nMy dear son! When I realized that I was getting old and when I felt that weakness and\nfeebleness are gradually creeping into me then I hastened to advise you as to the best ways of\nleading a noble, virtuous and useful life. I hated the idea that death should overtake me before\nI tell you all that I wanted to tell or before my mental capacities like my bodily strength are\nweakened. I convey all this to you lest inordinate desires, temptations and inducement should\nstart influencing you, or adverse changes of times and circumstances should drag your name\nin the mire or I should leave you like an untrained colt because a young and fresh mind is like\na virgin soil which allows things sown in it to grow verdantly and to bear luxuriantly.\nThen, I have made use of early opportunities to educate you and train you before your mind\nloses its freshness, before it gets hardened or warped, before you start facing life unprepared\nfor the encounter, and before you are forced to use your decisions and discretions without\ngaining advantages of cumulated traditions, collected knowledge and experiences of others.\nThese words of advice and counsels that I give you, will save you from the worry of acquiring\nknowledge, gathering experiences and soliciting advice from others. Now you can easily\nmake use of all the knowledge which men have to acquire with great care, trouble and\npatience. Things which were hidden from them and which only experiments, experiences and\nsufferings could bring to light are now made easily available to you through these\nexhortations.\nMy dear son! Though the span of my life is not as that of some other people who have passed\naway before me yet I took great care to study their lives, assiduously I went through their\nactivities, I contemplated over their deliberations and deeds, I studied their remains, relics and\nruins, I pondered over their lives so deeply that I felt as if I have lived and worked with them\nfrom early ages of history down to our times and I know what did them good and what\nbrought harm to them.\nSifting the good from bad I am concentrating within these pages, and for your good, the\nknowledge that I so gathered.\nThrough these pieces of advice I have tried to bring home to you the value of honest-living\nand high-thinking and the dangers of a vicious and sinful life, I have taken care to cover and\nguard every aspect of your life as it is the duty of a kind, considerate and loving father.\nFrom the very beginning, I took care to help you to develop a noble character and to fit you\nfor the life which you will have to lead, to let you grow up to be a young man with a noble\ncharacter, an open and honest mind and clear and precise knowledge of things around you.\nOriginally my desire was only to teach you the Holy Book thoroughly, to make you\nunderstand its intricacies, to impart to you the complete knowledge of His commandments\nand interdictions and not to leave you at the mercy of the knowledge of other people.\nBut after having succeeded in this task I felt nervous that I may leave you untrained and\nuneducated in the subjects which themselves are subject to so much confusion and so many\ncontradictions. These are the subjects whose confusions have been made worse confounded\nby selfish desires, warped minds, wicked ways of life and sinful modes of thinking.\nTherefore, I have noted down, in these lines, the basic principles of nobility, piety, truth and\njustice.\nYou may feel them to be over-bearing and harsh but my desire is to equip you with this\nknowledge instead of leaving you unarmed to face the world where there is every danger of\nloss and damnation.\nAs you are a noble, virtuous and pious young man, I am sure you will receive Divine\nGuidance and Succour. I am sure He will help you to achieve your aim in life. I want you to\npromise to yourself to follow my advice carefully.\nRemember my son! The best out of these pieces of advice of mine are the those which tell\nyou to fear Allah, to concentrate and to confine yourself to the performance of those duties\nwhich have been made incumbent upon you by Him and to follow in the footsteps of your\nancestors (The Holy Prophet (s) & Imam Ali (a)) and your pious and virtuous relationship.\nVerily, they always carefully measured their thoughts and deeds, as you must also try to do\nand they carefully thought over the subject before saying anything about it or before doing a\ndeed. You should also follow the same.\nThis kind of deliberation made them take from life what was really the best and forsake that\nwhich was not made incumbent upon them or which was not the best.\nIf your mind refuses to accept my advice and you persist to try your own experiments like\nthem then you are at liberty to arrive at your conclusions but only after thoroughly studying\nthe subject and after acquiring the knowledge necessary for such decisions.\nYou must not allow uncertainties and doubt poison your mind, scepticism or irrational likes\nand dislikes should not affect your views. But remember that before you start thinking and\ndeliberating over a problem seek guidance of the Lord and beseech Him to give you a lead in\nthe right direction.\nAvoid confusion in your ideas, and do not let disbelief take hold of your mind because the\nfirst will lead you to agnosticism and the others towards errors and sins. When you are thus\nprepared to solve any problem and you are sure that you possess a clear mind, a sincere and\nfirm desire to reach the truth, to say the correct thing and to do the correct deed, then carefully\ngo through the advice that I am leaving for you.\nIf your mind is not clear and it is not as free from doubts as you wish it to be, then you will be\nwandering in the wilderness of uncertainties and errors like a camel suffering from nightblindness.\nUnder these circumstances it is best for you to give up the quest because with such\nlimitations none can ever reach the truth.\nMy dear son! carefully and very carefully remember these sayings of mine. The Lord who is\nthe Master of death is also the Master of life. The Creator is the Annihilator. And the One\nwho annihilates has the power to bring everything back again to existence. The One who\nsends calamities has also the power to protect you from them.\nRemember that this world is working under the laws ordained by Him, and it consists of\nassemblage and aggregation of actions and reactions, causes and effects, calamities and\nreverses, pains and pleasures and rewards and punishments, but this is not all which the\npicture depicts, there are things in it which are beyond our ken, things which we do not and\ncannot know and things which cannot be foreseen and foretold, for example the rewards and\npunishments on the Day of Judgement. Under these circumstances, if you do not understand a\nthing, do not reject it. Remember that your lack of understanding is due to insufficiency of\nyour knowledge. Remember that when you came into this world your first appearance was\nthat of an ignorant, uneducated and unlearned being.\nThen you gradually acquired knowledge, but there were several things which were beyond\nyour knowledge, which perplexed and surprised you, and about which you did not\nunderstand. Gradually you acquired knowledge about some of those subjects and in future\nyour knowledge and vision may further expand.\nTherefore, the best thing for you to do is to seek guidance of One who has created you, Who\nmaintains and nourishes you, Who has given you a balanced mind and a normally working\nbody.\nYour invocations should be reserved for Him only, your requests and solicitations should be\nalone to Him and you should only be afraid of Him.\nBe it known to you, my son, that nobody has given mankind such detailed information about\nAllah as our Holy Prophet (s). I advise you to have faith in his teachings, to make him your\nleader and to accept his guidance for your salvation. Thus advising you I have done the best\nthat I can do as a sincere and loving adviser and I assure you that however you may try to find\na better way for your good, you will not find any superior to the one advised by me.\nRemember, my son, had there been any other god, besides the One, he would have also sent\nhis messengers and prophets and they would have pointed out to mankind the domain and\nglory of this second god, and you would have also seen them. But no such incident ever took\nplace. He is One Allah whom we should all recognize and worship. He has explained Himself.\nNobody is a partner to Him in His Domain, Might and Glory. He is Eternal, has always been\nand shall always be. He existed even before the Universe came into being but there is no\nbeginning to His Existence. He shall remain when every other thing shall vanish, and there\nshall be no end to His Existence. His Glory and His Existence is so supreme, pre-eminent,\ntranscendent, incomparable and excellent that it is beyond the grasp of intellects.\nNo one can understand or visualize Him.\nWhen you have accepted these facts then your behaviour, so far as His commands are\nconcerned, should be that of a person who realizes that his status, power and position is\nnothing when compared to that of His Lord; who wants to gain His Blessings through prayers\nand obedience, who fears His Wrath as well as His Punishments and who absolutely in need\nof His Help and Protection. Remember, my son, Allah has not ordered you to do anything but\nthat which is good and which propagates goodness and He has not prohibited you from\nanything but that which is bad and will bring about bad effects.\nMy dear son, through this message of mine, I have explained everything about this world,\nhow fickle and fleeting is its attitude, how short-lived and evanescent is everything that it\nholds or offers about and how fast it changes its moods and favours. I have also explained\nabout the life to come, the pleasures and blessings provided there, and the everlasting peace,\ncomfort and happiness arranged for in Paradise.\nI have given enough examples of both aspects of life, before and after death so that you may\nknow the reality and lead your life on the basis of that knowledge.\nAs a matter of fact those people who have carefully studied the condition of life and the\nworld, pass their days as if they know that they are travellers, who have to leave a place\nwhich is famine-stricken, unhealthy and uncongenial, and they have to proceed towards lands\nwhich are fertile, congenial, and where there is abundant provision of all comforts and\npleasures. They have eagerly taken up the journey, happy in the hope of future blessings and\npeace.\nThey have willingly accepted the sufferings, troubles and hazards of the way, parting of\nfriends, scarcity of food and comfort during the pilgrimage so that they may reach the\njourney's end - a happy place. They do not refuse to bear any discomfort and do not grudge\nany expenditure by way of giving out alms and charities, and helping the poor and the needy.\nEvery step which they put forward towards their goal, however tiring and exhausting it may\nbe, is a happy event of their lives. On the contrary the condition of those people who are\nsolely engrossed in this world and are sadly engulfed in its short-lived, quickly fading and\nvicious pleasures, is like that of travellers who are staying in fertile and happy regions and\nwho have to undertake a journey, knowing fully well that the journey is going to end in a\nrough, arid and infertile land.\nCan anything be more loathsome and abhorring to them than this journey? How they would\nhate to leave the place where they are and to arrive at a place which they so much hate and\nwhich is so dismaying, dreadful and horrifying!\nMy dear son, so far as your behaviour with other human beings is concerned, let your 'self' act\nas scales to judge its goodness or wickedness. Do unto others as you wish others to do unto\nyou.\nWhatever you like for yourself, like for others, and whatever you dislike to happen to you,\nspare others from such happenings. Do not oppress and tyrannize anybody because you surely\ndo not like to be oppressed and tyrannized. Be kind and sympathetic to others as you certainly\ndesire others to treat you kindly and sympathetically. If you find objectionable and loathsome\nhabits in others, abstain from developing those traits of character in yourself.\nIf you are satisfied or feel happy in receiving a certain kind of behaviour from others, you\nmay behave with others in exactly the same way.\nDo not speak about them in the same way that you do not like others to speak about you. Do\nnot speak on a subject about which you know little or nothing, and if you at all want to speak\non anything or about anyone of whom you are fully aware, then avoid scandal, libel and\naspersion as you do not like yourself to be scandalized and scorned in the same manner.\nRemember, son, that vanity and conceit are forms of folly. These traits will bring to you\nserious harm and will be a constant source of danger to you. Therefore, lead a well-balanced\nlife (neither be conceited nor suffer from inferiority complex) and exert yourself to earn an\nhonest living. But do not act like a treasure for somebody (do not be miserly so that you leave\nwhat you hoard for others). And whenever you receive guidance of the Lord to achieve a\nthing you desire, then do not get proud of your achievement but be humble and submissive to\nHim and realize that your success was due to His Mercy.\nRemember my son, that before you is a long and arduous journey (life). The journey is not\nonly very long, exhausting and onerous but the route is mostly through dismal, dreary and\ndeserted regions where you will be sadly in need of refreshing, renovating and enlivening aids\nand helps and you cannot dispense with such provisions as to keep you going and to maintain\nyou till the end of the journey - the Day of Judgement.\nBut remember not to overload yourself (do not entrust yourself with so many obligations and\nduties that you cannot honourably fulfil them or with such luxurious life as to be wicked and\nvicious).\nBecause if this load is more than what you can conveniently bear then your journey will be\nvery painful and tiresome to you. If you find around you such poor, needy and destitute\npeople who are willing to carry your load for you as far as the Day of Judgement then\nconsider this to be a boon, engage them and pass your burden on to them.\n(Distribute your wealth amongst the poor, destitute and the needy, help others to the best of\nyour ability and be kind and sympathetic to human beings). Thus relieve yourself from the\nheavy responsibility and liability of submitting an account on the Day of Judgement of how\nyou have made use of His Bounties (of health, wealth, power and position) and thus you may\narrive at the end of the journey, light and fresh, have enough provision for you there (reward\nof having done your duty to man and Allah in this world).\nHave as many weight-carriers as you can (help as many as you can) so that you may not miss\nthem when you very badly need them (when your sins of commission and omission will be\nbalanced against your good deeds you must have enough good deeds to turn the scale in your\nfavour). Remember that all you give out in charities and good deeds are like loans which will\nbe paid back to you.\nTherefore, when you are wealthy and powerful, make use of your wealth and power in such a\nway that you get all that back on the Day of Judgement, when you will be poor and helpless.\nBe it known to you, my son, that your passage lies through an appallingly dreadful valley\n(death or grave) and extremely trying and arduous journey.\nHere a man with light weight is far better than an over-burdened person and one who can\ntravel fast will pass through it quickly than the one whose encumbering forces go slowly. You\nshall have to pass through this valley.\nThe only way out of it is either in Paradise or in Hell. Therefore, it is wise to send your things\nthere beforehand so that they (good deeds) reach there before you, prearrange for the place of\nyour stay before you reach there because after death there is no repentance and no possibility\nof coming back to this world to undo the wrong done by you.\nRealize this truth, my son, that the Lord who owns and holds the treasures of Paradise and the\nearth has given you permission to ask and beg for them and He has promised to grant your\nprayers. He has told you to pray for His Favours that they may be granted to you and to ask\nfor His Blessings that they may be bestowed upon you. He has not appointed guards to\nprevent your prayers reaching Him. Nor is there any need for anybody to intercede before\nHim on your behalf.\nIf you go back upon your promises, if your break your vows, or start doing things that you\nhave repented of, He will not immediately punish you nor does He refuse His Blessings in\nhaste and if you repent once again He neither taunts you nor betrays you though you may\nfully deserve both, but He accepts your penitence and pardons you.\nHe never grudges His Forgiveness nor refuses His Mercy, on the contrary He has decreed\nrepentance as a virtue and pious deed. The Merciful Lord has ordered that every evil deed of\nyours will be counted as one and a good deed and pious action will be rewarded tenfold. He\nhas left the door of repentance open. He hears you whenever you call Him.\nHe accepts your prayer whenever you pray to Him. Invoke Him to grant you your heart's\ndesire, lay before Him the secrets of your heart, tell Him about all the calamities that have\nbefallen you and misfortunes which face you, and beseech His help to overcome them. You\nmay invoke His Help and Support in difficulties and distresses.\nYou may implore Him to grant you long life and sound health, you may pray to Him for\nprosperity and you may request Him for such favours and grants that none but He can bestow\nand award.\nThink over it that by simply granting you the privilege of praying for His Favours and\nMercies, He has handed over the keys of His treasures to you. Whenever you are in need you\nshould pray and He will confer His Bounties and Blessings. But sometimes you will find that\nyour requests are not immediately granted, then you need not be disappointed because the\ngrant of prayers often rests with the true purpose and intention of the implorer.\nSometimes the prayers are delayed because the Merciful Lord wants you to receive further\nrewards for patiently bearing calamities and sufferings and still believing sincerely in His\nHelp. Thus you may be awarded better favours than you requested for.\nSometimes your prayers are turned down, and this is also in your interest; because you often,\nunknowingly, ask for things that are really harmful to you. If your requests are granted they\nwill do you more harm than good and many of your requests may be such that if they are\ngranted they will result in your eternal damnation. Thus the refusal to accede to your\nsolicitations is a blessing in disguise to you. But very often your requests, if they are not\nreally harmful to you in this life or in the Hereafter, may be delayed but they are granted in\nquantities much more than you had asked for, bringing in more blessings in their wake than\nyou could ever imagine. So you should be very careful in asking Allah for His Favour.\nOnly pray for such things as are really beneficial to you, and are lasting and in the long run do\nnot end in harm. Remember, my dear son, that wealth and power (if you pray for them) are\nsuch things that they will not always be with you and may bring harm to you in the life in the\nHereafter.\nBe it known to you, my son, that you are created for the next world and not for this.\nYou are born to die and not to live forever. Your stay in this world is transient. You live in a\nplace which is subject to decay and destruction. It is a place where you will have to be busy\ngetting ready for the next world. It is a road (to the next world) on which you are standing.\nDeath is following you. You cannot run away from it. However hard you may try to avoid it,\nit is going to catch you sooner or later. Therefore take care that it may not catch you unawares\nor when you are not prepared for it, and no chance is left to you to repent the vices and sins\ncommitted and to undo the harm done by you.\nIf death catches you unawares, then you are eternally damned. Therefore, my dear son,\nalways keep three things in mind: death, your deeds and the life in the Hereafter. In this way\nyou will always be ready to face death and it will not catch you unawares.\nMy dear son, do not be carried away and be allured by the infatuations of the worldly people\nin the vicious life and its pleasures, and do not be impressed by the sight of their acute\nstruggle to possess and own this world. Allah has very mercifully explained to you everything\nabout this world. Not only the Merciful Lord but also the world has also told you everything;\nit has disclosed to you that it is mortal; it has openly declared its weakness, its shortcomings\nand its vices.\nRemember that these worldly-minded people are like barking dogs and hungry and ferocious\nbeasts. Some of them are constantly barking at others. The mighty lords kill and massacre the\npoor and the weak.\nTheir powerful persons exploit and tyrannize the powerless.\nTheir inordinate desires and their greed has such a complete hold over them that you will find\nsome of them like animals tamed and tied with a rope round their feet and necks. (They have\nlost the freedom of thought and cannot come out of the enslavement of their desires and\nhabits).\nWhile they are others whom wealth and power have turned mad. They behave like unruly\nbeasts, trampling, crushing and killing their fellow beings, and destroying things around them.\nThe history of this world is merely a reward of such incidents, some big and some small, the\ndifference is of might but the intensity is the same. These people have lost the balance of their\nminds.\nThey do not know what they are doing and where they are going, scan their activities and\nstudy their ways of thinking and you will find them confused and irrational, they appear like\ncattle wandering in a dreary desert where there is no water to drink and no fodder to eat, no\nshepherd to cater for them and no guardian to look after them. What has actually happened to\nthem is that the vicious world has taken possession of them, it is dragging them wherever it\nlikes, and is treating them as if they are blind because it has in reality blind-folded them\nagainst Divine light of true religion.\nThey are wandering without reasonable aims and sober purposes in the bewitching show that\nthe world has staged for them, they are fully intoxicated with the pleasures amassed around\nthem. They take this world to be their god and nourisher. The world is amusing them and they\nare amused with it and have forgotten and forsaken everything else.\nBut the nights of enjoyments and pleasures will not last long for anybody, the dawn of\nrealities will break sooner or later. The caravan of life will surely reach its destination one\nday. One who has nights and days acting as piebald horses for him, carrying him onward and\nonward towards his journey's end must remember that though he may feel as if he is stopping\nat one place yet actually he is moving on, he is proceeding to his destination. Everyday is\ncarrying him a step further in his journey towards death.\nBe it known to you, my son, that you cannot have every wish of yours granted, you cannot\nexpect to escape death, and you are passing through your days of life as others before you\nhave passed. Therefore, control your expectations, desires and cravings. Be moderate in your\ndemands. Earn your livelihood through scrupulously honest means.\nBe contented with what you get honestly and honourably. Have patience and do not let your\ndesires drive you madly because there are many desires which will lead you towards\ndisappointments and loss. Remember that every beggar or everyone who prays for a thing will\nnot always get what he begs or prays for and everyone who controls his desire, has selfrespect\nand does not beg or pray for things, will not always remain unlucky or disappointed.\nSo, do not bring down your self-respect, do not be mean and submissive and do not subjugate\nyourself through these vile and base traits though they may appear to make it possible for you\nto secure your hearts desires because nothing in this world can compensate for the loss of selfrespect,\nnobility and honour.\nTake care, my son! Be warned that you do not make yourself a slave of anybody. Allah has\ncreated you a freeman. Do not sell away your freedom in return of anything.\nThere is no actual gain and real value in benefits that you derive by selling your honour and\nself-respect or by subjugating yourself to disgrace and insults as there is no real good in\nwealth and power that you acquire by foul means.\nBeware, my son, that avarice and greed may not drive you towards destruction and\ndamnation. If you can succeed in having nobody as your benefactor but Allah, then try your\nbest to achieve this nobility because He will grant you your share whether you try to taunt\nyour donors, patrons and benefactors or not.\nRemember that the little which is given to you by Allah is going to be more useful and\nserviceable to you and is more honourable and respectable than what is granted by man in\nabundance. And what can a man give you but part of that which Allah has granted him?\nThe losses that you suffer on account of your silence can be easily compensated but the losses\nwhich arise out of excessive and loose talk are difficult to requite. Do you not see that the best\nway of guarding water in a water-bay is to close its mouth.\nTo guard what you already possess is better than to beg from others.\nThe bitterness of disappointment and poverty is in reality sweeter than the disgrace of\nbegging.\nReturns of hard but respectable labour of a craft or profession, though small in quantity, are\nbetter than the wealth which you amass through sin and wickedness.\nNobody can guard your secrets better than you.\nOften a man tries his best to acquire a thing which is most harmful to him.\nOne who talks too much makes most mistakes.\nOne who often reflects, develops his foresight.\nBy keeping company with good people, you will develop your character and by avoiding the\nsociety of wicked persons, you will abstain from wickedness.\nLivelihood acquired by foul means is the worst form of livelihood.\nTo oppress a weak and helpless person is the worst form of ferocity.\nIf your kindness or indulgence is going to bring forth cruel results, then severity of strictness\nis the real kindness.\nOften medicating results in disease; sometimes diseases prove to be health preservers.\nOften you obtain warnings and advice from people who are not fit to warn and advise you and\noften you come across advisers who are not sincere.\nDo not rely on vain hopes because vain hopes are assets of fools and idiots.\nWisdom is the name of the trait of remembering experiences and making use of them. The\nbest experience is the one which gives the best warning and advice.\nTake advantage of opportunities before they turn their backs on you.\nEveryone who tries cannot succeed.\nEveryone who departs this life will not return.\nThe worst form of follies is to waste opportunities of this life as well as to lose salvation.\nFor every action there is a reaction.\nShortly you will get what has been destined for you.\nThere is an element of risk and speculation in every trade as well as danger of loss.\nOften small returns prove as beneficial as big profits.\nAn accessory of an accomplice who insults you and a friend who has not formed a good\nopinion of you will not be of any help or use to you.\nTreat those with consideration and kindness over whom you have power and authority.\nDo not run the risk of endangering yourself through irrational, unreasonable and extravagant\nhopes.\nTake care so as not to be fooled by flattery.\nDo good to your brother when he is bent upon doing harm to you. When he ignores or\ndeclines to recognize the kinship, befriend him, go to his help and try to maintain relations. If\nhe is miserly with you and refuses to help you, be generous with him and support him\nfinancially. If he is cruel with you, be kind and considerate with him.\nIf he harms you accept his excuses. Behave with him as if he is a master and you are a slave,\nand he is a benefactor and you are a beneficiary. But be careful that you do not thus behave\nwith undeserving and mean persons.\nDo not develop friendship with the enemy of your friend otherwise your friend will turn into\nan enemy.\nAdvise your friend sincerely and to the best of your ability even though he may not like it.\nKeep a complete control over your temper and anger because I never found anything more\nbeneficial at the end and producing more good results than such a control.\nBe mild, pleasant and lenient with him who is harsh, gross, and strict with you; gradually he\nwill turn to your behaviour.\nGrant favour and be considerate to your enemy because you will thus gain either one of the\ntwo kinds of victories: (one rising above your enemy, the other of reducing the intensity of his\nhostility).\nIf you want to cease relations with your friend, then do not break off totally, let your heart\nretain some consideration for him so that you will still have some regard for him if he comes\nback to you.\nDo not disappoint a person who holds a good opinion of you and do not make him change his\nopinion.\nUnder the impression that you, as a friend, can behave as you like, do not violate the rights of\nyour friend because, when he is deprived of his rights and privileges, he will no more remain\nyour friend.\nDo not ill-treat members of your family and do not behave with them as if you are the most\ncruel man alive.\nDo not run after him who tries to avoid you.\nThe greatest achievement of your character is that the hostility of your brother against you\ndoes not overcome the consideration and friendship you feel towards him, and his illtreatment\nof you does not overbalance your kind treatment to him.\nDo not get worried and depressed over the oppressions because whoever oppresses you is in\nreality doing himself harm and is trying to find ways for your good.\nNever ill-treat a person who has done good to you.\nKnow it well, son, that there are two kinds of livelihood: one which you are searching for and\nthe other which follows you (which has been destined for you).\nIt will reach you even if you do not try to obtain it.\nTo be submissive, humble, crawling and begging when one is needy, powerless and poor and\nto be arrogant, oppressing and cruel when in power and opulence are two very ugly traits of\nthe human character.\nNothing in this world is really useful to you unless it has some utility and value for you for\nthe next world. If you at all want to lament over things which you have lost in this world then\nworry about the loss of things which had immortal values for you.\nThe past and almost all that was in your possession during the past is not with you know. You\nmay thus rationally come to the conclusion that the present and all that is in your possession\nnow will also leave you.\nDo not be like persons on whom advice has no effect; they require punishment to improve\nthem. A sensible man acquires education and culture through advice, while brutes and beasts\nalways improve through punishment.\nOvercome your sorrows, your worries and your misfortunes with patience and faith in the\nMerciful Lord and your hard work; one who gives up a straight path, honest and rational ways\nof thinking and working, will harm himself.\nA friend is like a relation and a true friend is one who speaks well of you even behind your\nback.\nInordinate desires are related with misfortunes.\nOften close relations behave more distantly than strangers and often strangers help you more\nthan your nearest relatives.\nPoor is he who has no friends.\nWhoever forsakes truth finds that his path of life has become narrow and troublesome.\nContentment and honesty are the lasting assets to retain ones prestige and position.\nThe strongest relation is the one which is between man and Allah.\nOne who does not care for you is your enemy.\nIf there is a danger of death or destruction in securing an object then safety lies in avoiding it.\nWeaknesses and shortcomings are not the things to talk about.\nOpportunities do not repeat themselves.\nSometimes very wise and learned persons fail to achieve the object they were aiming at and\nfoolish and uneducated people attain their purposes.\nPostpone evil deeds as long as possible because you can commit them whenever you so desire\n(then why hurry in committing them).\nTo cut connections with ignorant people is itself like forming connections with wise persons.\nWhoever trusts this world is betrayed by it and whoever gives it importance is disgraced by it.\nEvery arrow of yours will not hit the bull's eye.\nWhen status changes your conditions also change.\nBefore ascertaining the conditions of a route, find out what kinds of persons will accompany\nyou on the journey.\nInstead of enquiring about the condition of the home in which you are going to stay, first of\nall try to find out what kind of people your neighbours are.\nDo not introduce ridiculous topics in your talk even if you have to repeat sayings of others.\nDo not seek the advice of women, their verdicts are often immature and incorrect and their\ndeterminations are not firm. You must guard and defend them and act as a shelter to protect\nthem from impious and injurious surroundings and infamous sights, this kind of shelter will\nkeep them well-protected from every harm. Their contact with a vicious and sinful\natmosphere (even with all the shelter that you can provide) is going to prove more harmful\nthan being left with protection. Do not let them interfere with affairs where you cannot\npersonally guide or protect them. Do not let them aspire for things which are beyond their\ncapacities. They are more like decoration to humanity and are not made to rule and govern\nhumanity. Exhibit reasonable interest in things which they desire and give importance to\nthem, but do not let them influence your opinions and do not let them impel you to go against\nyour sane views.\nDo not force them into marriages which they abhor or which they consider below their dignity\nbecause there is danger of thus converting honourable and virtuous women into shameless\nand dishonourable beings.\nDivide and distribute work among your servants so that you can hold each one responsible for\nthe work entrusted to them. This is a better and smoother way of carrying on a work than each\none of them throwing the responsibility of every bit of work on somebody else.\nTreat the members of your family with love and respect because they act as wings with which\nyou fly and as hands which support you and fight for you. They are people towards whom\nyou turn when you are in trouble and in need.\nMy dear son! After having given these pieces of advice to you I entrust you to the Lord. He\nwill help, guide and protect you in this world and the Hereafter. I beseech Him to take you\nunder His protection in both the worlds."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_38.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_38.md","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/letters/letter_39","_dir":"letters","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Letter 39","description":"A letter to Mu'awiya.","body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"You have misguided the whole generation of men around you.

I have received information that a person of Basra invited you to a dinner and\nyou immediately accepted the invitation. I have also heard that very sumptuous meals were\nserved there! Finest varieties of viands were placed before you in large plates and you\nenjoyed them.\nI am sorry to hear the news. I never expected that you would accept the invitation of a person\nwho invites big officers and rich people and from whose doors poor persons and hungry\npaupers are turned away rudely.\nLook carefully into the things which you eat. If there is even a shade of their being obtained\nunlawfully then throw them away, only eat those things about which you are perfectly certain\nthat they are obtained by honest means.\nYou must know Ibn Hunayf, that for everyone who follows a religion there is a leader and a\nguide from whom the follower learns the canons of that religion and the ways of leading a\npious life. Now look to your Imam (Imam Ali (a) meant himself).\nIn this world he has satisfied himself with two old, torn and coarse garments and two pieces\nof bread (one in the morning and one in the evening). I know that to adopt such a hard way of\nlife is beyond you but at least try to be pious. Try to follow me and be my companion in\nvirtue, piety and simple living.\nI swear by Allah that from this world I have neither amassed gold nor have I gathered wealth\nand possessions nor have I changed these coarse and old garments of mine with even an\nordinary raiment from your treasury.\nVerily, under the sky we had only Fadak as our personal property but we were deprived of it,\nit tempted them, they took it by force and we had to bear the wrench patiently and cheerfully,\nthe best judge is the Lord Almighty. What was I going to do with Fadak or with any other\nworldly possession? I never wanted them for myself. I know that tomorrow my lodging will\nbe my grave.\nIts darkness will cover my traces and will not allow my condition to reach this world. A grave\nafter all is a pit, and even if it is made very big and broad, time will gradually reduce its size\nand will fill it with earth and stones.\nMy attention is concentrated on one thing, that is, with the help of the fear of Allah and piety I\nkeep my desires under control so that in this world I may not commit sins and errors and on\nthe Day of Judgement when fear will be the lot of everybody I may feel safe and satisfied.\nIf I had so wanted I could have very easily found ways and means to provide for myself the\npurest honey, the best variety of wheat and the finest silk clothes that could be woven.\nBut it is not possible for inordinate cravings to overcome me and it is not possible that\ngreediness persuades me to acquire the best provisions when in Hijaz and Yemen there may\nbe people who have no hope of obtaining a piece of bread and who have never satisfied their\nhunger fully.\nIt is not possible for me to satiate myself when there are around me people whom hunger and\nthirst keeps restless and agonized.\nDo you want me to be like that person about whom somebody has very aptly said, \"Is this\ndisease not enough for you that you keep on sleeping with your stomach full, and around you\nthere are such starving mouths that will greedily eat even dried goat-skin\"?\nShall I be satisfied simply because people call me \"Amir al-Mu'minin\" (Leader of the faithful\nMuslims)? Shall I not sympathise with the faithful Muslims in their calamities? Shall I not be\ntheir partner in their adversities? Shall I not be their fellow-sufferer? Shall I not set an\nexample for them to patiently, courageously and virtuously bear privation?\nAm I created simply to keep on thinking about my food? Am I like that animal which is tied\ndown to a post and which thinks of nothing but its fodder or like that uncontrolled beast\nwhich roams about and does nothing but eats its fill and does not know the purpose of life for\nwhich it is created? Have I no religion, no conscience and no fear of Allah? Am I left\nabsolutely free without any check or control to do as I like? Am I at liberty to go astray, to\nwander away from the true path of religion and to roam about in the wilderness of greed and\navarice?\nI am sure some of you would say that if the son of Abu Taalib eats so little and lives on\nstarvation, then surely he must have gone weak and exhausted and must be unfit to face his\nenemies in battlefields.\nBut you must remember that hardy trees which grow on the border of deserts have very strong\ntimber; and trees which are found in marshy lands have thin bark and soft wood, similarly\nwhen the former are lit up they burn longer and with a very strong glow and give out more\nheat than the latter.\nMy relationship with the Holy Prophet (s) is like a branch shooting from the same stem or like\nthe relation of the wrist to the arm. I swear by Allah that even if all the Arabs unite together\nagainst me I shall not run away from the battlefield and when the occasion arrives I shall do\nmy best to subdue them, at the same time I shall try to clean the earth of the existence and\nvicious influence of that untimely evil genius and warped mind (Mu'awiya) so that the land\nmay be free of his wicked and sinful sway.\nO vicious world! Do not try to snare me, you cannot entrap me, I am beyond your temptations\nand pitfalls and I have taken good care not to slip into such pitfalls.\nWhere are those people whom you had tempted with pleasures and enjoyments? Where are\nthose groups whom you had allured with pomp and glory? They are imprisoned in their\ngraves pressed down by tons of earth upon them. O vicious world! Had you been a person or\na being with life and limbs I would have punished you under the laws of the Lord because\nyou have tempted with impossible hopes millions of individuals from the true path of\nhumanity, you have brought about destruction, decline and falls of nations after nations\nalluring them with power and pleasure, you have thrown crowned heads into dust, you have\nlowered them to such depths that there is no refuge for any of them at that place and no one\ncan come out from there.\nWoe be to the man who with misplaced confidence, steps on the slippery ground presented by\nyou as a firm foothold, he will certainly slip; woe be to the man who thinks of riding the\nwaves of false hopes and expectations raised by you, he will surely sink.\nWhoever tries not to be entrapped by your temptations and snared by your allurements will\nfind the straight path to safety and salvation. Whoever tries to spurn you does not care for the\nconsequences of his action though he may find himself in adverse circumstances and\ndifficulties. To him this world, its pleasures and the life surrounded by the pleasures or by\nwoes and afflictions, is like a day which will soon pass away.\nBe gone from me. I can neither be caught unawares by you that you may plunge me into\ndisgrace and humiliations nor will I lose control of myself that you may drag me wherever\nyou like.\nI swear by Allah that barring His Destiny over which I have no control and which may mould\nmy life as He wishes, I shall control myself that I shall be contented and happy if I get one\npiece of bread with a pinch of salt and that my mind will be dead to the desires of pleasures,\nfame, power and glory.\nIbn Hunayf! You have seen sheep and goats, after eating and drinking their fill they retire to\ntheir den. Do you want Ali to be like them - to eat, drink and enjoy? May I get blind if after\nhaving passed so many years of my life I now turn into an animal in human form!\nHappy is the person who did his duty with Allah and man, who bore adversities patiently and\nwhen sleep overpowered him he used his hand as a pillow and lay on mere earth along with\nthose whom fear of the Day of Judgement has often kept awake, who do not find much time\nto sleep, whose lips keep on moving glorifying Allah, and whose sins have been absolved on\naccount of the penance they impose upon themselves. They are noble persons and they\ncertainly will secure salvation.\nO Ibn Hunayf! fear Allah and be content with the bread that you get with lawful means, so\nthat you may be exempted and free from the fire of Hell."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_52.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_52.md","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/letters/letter_53","_dir":"letters","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Letter 53","description":"A letter from Imam Ali (a) to one of his governors.","body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"You are one of those persons whose assistance I require in propagating the religion, in\nstrengthening its hold, in defeating the unbelievers and sinners and in guarding dangerous\nfrontiers of this State.

Allah has further ordered you to keep your desires under control, to keep yourself\nunder restraint when extravagant and inordinate yearnings and cravings try to drive you\ntowards vice and wickedness because usually your 'self' tries to incite and drag you towards\ninfamy and damnation unless the Merciful Lord comes to your help.\nLet it be known to you, Maalik, that I am sending you as a governor to a country which has\nseen many regimes before this. Some of them were benign, sympathetic and good, while\nothers were tyrannical, oppressive and cruel. People will judge your regime as critically as\nyou have studied the activities of other regimes and they will criticize you in the same way as\nyou have censured or approved other rulers.\nYou must know that a good and virtuous man is known and recognized by the good that is\nsaid about him and the praise which Allah has destined him to receive from others.\nTherefore, make your mind the source and fountain-head of good thoughts, good intentions\nand good deeds. This can only be attained by keeping a strict control on your desires and\nyearnings, however much they may try to incite and coerce you. Remember that the best way\nto do justice to your inner self and to keep it out of harm is to restrain it from vice and from\nthings which the 'self' inordinately and irrationally desires.\nMaalik! You must create in your mind kindness, compassion and love for your subjects. Do\nnot behave towards them as if you are a voracious and ravenous beast and as if your success\nlies in devouring them.\nRemember, Maalik, that amongst your subjects there are two kinds of people: those who have\nthe same religion as you have; they are brothers to you, and those who have religions other\nthan that of yours, they are human beings like you. Men of either category suffer from the\nsame weaknesses and disabilities that human beings are inclined to, they commit sins, indulge\nin vices either intentionally or foolishly and unintentionally without realizing the enormity of\ntheir deeds. Let your mercy and compassion come to their rescue and help in the same way\nand to the same extent that you expect Allah to show mercy and forgiveness to you.\nMaalik! You must never forget that if you are a ruler over them than the caliph is the ruler\nover you and Allah is the Supreme Lord over the caliph. And the reality is that He has\nappointed you as the governor and tested you through the responsibility of this rulership over\nthem.\nNever think of raising yourself to such a false prestige that you can declare war against Allah\nbecause you cannot ward off His Wrath and you can never be free from the need of His\nMercy and Compassion.\nDo not feel ashamed to forgive and forget. Do not hurry over punishments and do not be\npleased and do not be proud of your power to punish. Do not get angry and lose your temper\nquickly over the mistakes and failures of those over whom you rule.\nOn the contrary, be patient and sympathetic with them. Anger and desire of vengeance are not\ngoing to be of much help to you in your administration.\nNever say to yourself, \"I am their Lord, their ruler and all in all over them and that I must be\nobeyed submissively and humbly\" because such a thought will unbalance your mind, will\nmake you vain and arrogant, will weaken your faith in religion and will make you seek\nsupport of any power other than that of Allah . If you ever feel any pride or vanity on account\nof your sway and rule over your subjects then think of the supreme sway and rule of the Lord\nover the Universe, the extent of His creations, the supremacy of His Might and Glory, His\nPower to do things which you cannot even dream of doing and His control over you which is\nmore dominating than that which you can ever achieve over anything around you. Such\nthoughts will cure your mental weakness, will keep you away from vanity and rebellion\n(against Allah), will reduce your arrogance and haughtiness and will take you back to the\nsanity which you had foolishly deserted.\nTake care never to think of bringing yourself at par with Allah, never to think of matching\nyour power with Him and contesting His Glory and ever to pretend that you possess might\nand power like Him because the Mighty Lord will always humble pitiless tyrants and will\ndegrade all pretenders of His Power and Might.\nSo far as your own affairs or those of your relatives and friends are concerned take care that\nyou do not violate the duties laid down upon you by Allah and do not usurp the rights of\nmankind, be impartial and do justice to them because if you give up equity and justice then\nyou will certainly be a tyrant and an oppressor. And whoever tyrannizes and oppresses the\ncreatures of Allah, will earn enmity of Allah along with the hatred of those whom he has\noppressed; and whoever earns the Wrath of Allah loses all chances of salvation and he has no\nexcuse to offer on the Day of Judgement.\nEvery tyrant and oppressor is an enemy of Allah unless he repents and gives up oppression.\nRemember, Maalik! that there is nothing in this world more effective to turn His Blessings\ninto His Wrath quicker than to insist upon oppression over His creatures because the Merciful\nAllah will always hear the prayers of those who have been oppressed and He will give no\nchance to oppressors.\nYou must always appreciate and adopt a policy which is neither too severe nor too lenient, a\npolicy which is based upon equity will be largely appreciated. Remember that the displeasure\nof common men, the have-nots and the depressed persons more overbalances than the\napproval of important persons, while the displeasure of a few big people will be excused by\nthe Lord if the general public and the masses of your subjects are happy with you.\nRemember, Maalik! that usually these big personages are mentally the scum of the human\nsociety, they are the people who will be the worst drag upon you during your moments of\npeace and happiness, and the least useful to you during your hours of need and adversity, they\nhate justice the most, they will keep on demanding more and more out of the State resources\nand will seldom be satisfied with what they receive and will never be obliged for the favour\nshown to them if their demands are justifiable refused, they will never accept any reasonable\nexcuse or any rational argument and when the time changes, you will never find them\nstaunch, faithful and loyal.\nWhile the common men, the poor and apparently the less important section of your subjects\nare the pillars of Islam, they are the real assemblage of Muslims and the power and defensive\nforce against the enemies of Islam. Keep your mind on their affairs, be more friendly with\nthem and secure their trust and goodwill.\nBut be careful in forming your contacts (whether with the most important persons or the\ncommoners); keep such people away from you and think them to be the enemy of the State\nwho are scandal-mongers and who try to find fault with others and carry on propaganda\nagainst them because everywhere people have weaknesses and failings and it is the duty of\nthe government to overlook (minor) shortcomings. You must not try to go in search of those\nweaknesses which are hidden from you, leave them to Allah, and about those weaknesses\nwhich come to your notice, you must try to teach them how to overcome them. Try not to\nexpose the weaknesses of the people and Allah will conceal your own weaknesses which you\ndo not want anybody to know.\nDo not give cause to the people to envy each other (man against man, tribe against tribe or\none section of the society against the other). Try to alleviate and root out mutual distrust and\nenmity from amongst your subjects.\nBe fair, impartial and just in your dealings with all, individually and collectively and be\ncareful not to make your person, position and favours act as sources of malice. Do not let any\nsuch thing or such person come near to you who does not deserve your nearness and your\nfavour. Never lower your dignity and prestige.\nRemember that backbiters and scandal-mongers belong to a mean and cunning group, though\nthey pretend to be sincere advisers. Do not make haste to believe the news they bring and do\nnot heed to their advice.\nDo not accept the advice of misers, they will try their best to keep you away from acts of\nkindness and from doing good to others. They will make you frightened of poverty.\nSimilarly do not allow cowards to act as your advisers because they will make you timid in\nenforcing your orders, will scare you from handling important affairs boldly and will make\nyour enterprises and invasions timid and timorous attempts. At the same time avoid greedy\nand covetous persons who would aspire to the position of acting as your counsellor because\nhe will teach you how to exploit the community and how to oppress people to get their\nwealth. Remember that miserliness, cowardice and greed appear to be different wicked\nqualities but they all arise from the same evil mentality of having no faith and no trust in\nAllah.\nYour worst ministers will be the men who had been ministers to the despotic rulers before\nyou and who had been a party o atrocities committed by them. Such persons should not be\ntaken into your confidence and should not be trusted because they have aided sinners and\nhave assisted tyrants and cruel rulers.\nIn their stead you can comfortably find persons who are equally wise and learned but who\nhave not developed sinful and criminal mentalities, who have neither helped the tyrants in\ntheir tyrannies nor have they assisted them to carry on their sinful deeds. Such persons will\nprove the least troublesome to you. They will be the most helpful. They will sincerely\nsympathise with you. If you take them in your confidence they will sever their connections\nwith your opponents. Keep such people with you as your companions in your informal\ncompany as well as in official gatherings in audience. From amongst such honest and humane\ncompanions and ministers some would receive your fullest confidence and trust. They are\nthose who can always speak out the bitter truth to you and unreservedly and without fear of\nyour status, can refuse to assist you or associate with you in the deeds which Allah does not\nlike His good creatures to commit.\nSelect honest, truthful and pious people as your companions. Train them not to flatter you and\nnot to seek your favour by false praises because flattery and false praises create vanity and\nconceit and they make a man lose sight of his real self and ignore his duties.\nYou should not treat good and bad people alike because in this way you will be discouraging\ngood persons and at the same time emboldening the wicked to carry on their wickedness.\nEveryone should receive the treatment which his deeds make him deserve.\nTry carefully to realize that a ruler can create goodwill in the minds of his subjects and can\nmake them faithful and sincere to him only when he is kind and considerate to them, when he\nreduces their troubles, when he does not oppress them and when he never asks for things\nwhich are beyond their power.\nThese are the principles which you should keep in mind and act upon. Let your attitude be\nsuch that they do not lose faith in you because a good faith on their part will reduce many\ntroubles of administration and will relieve you of many worries and anxieties. And so far as\nyour confidence and trust is concerned, let it rest with those people whom you have tested in\ndifficulties and whom you have befriended, but you should always mistrust those people\nwhom you have wronged or who have proved themselves undeserving, inefficient or\nunfaithful.\nDo not give up those practices and do not break those rules which good Muslims have\nevolved or introduced before you, which have created unity and amity among the various\nsections of the society and which have benefited the masses.\nDo not break them and do not introduce innovations because if you do away with those good\nrules and traditions, the reward of having introduced them will go to those who evolved them\nand the punishment of having despoiled them will be your lot.\nYou must know, Maalik, that the people over whom you rule are divided into classes and\ngrades and the prosperity and welfare of each class of the society individually and collectively\nare so interdependent upon the well-being of the other classes that the whole set-up represents\na closely woven net and reciprocal aspect. One class cannot exist peacefully, cannot live\nhappily and cannot work without the support and good wishes of the other.\nAmongst them there are the soldiers of the army of Allah who defend His cause, the next\nclass is that of the secretaries of the State to whom duties of writing out and issuing special or\ngeneral orders are assigned, the third group is of the judges and magistrates to administer\njustice, the fourth is of officers who maintain law and order and guard the peace and\nprosperity of the country. Then there are common men, the Muslims who pay the taxes levied\nby the government, and non-Muslims who pay the taxes levied by the government, and non-\nMuslims who pay tribute to the State (in lieu of taxes). Then comes the class of men who\ncarry on various professions and trades and the last but not the least are the poor and the havenots\nwho are considered as the lowest class of the society. The Merciful Allah has fixed rights\nand duties of each one of them. They have been either mentioned in His Book or explained\nthrough the instructions of the Holy Prophet (s). A complete code of them is preserved with\nus.\nAs far as the soldiers are concerned, they are by the commands of Allah a fortress and\nstronghold to guard and defend the subjects and the State. They are the ornaments of the ruler\nand the country. They provide power and protection to the religion. They propagate and\npreserve peace among mankind. In fact, they are the real guardians of peace and through them\ngood internal administration can be maintained. The upkeep and maintenance of an army\ndepends upon the taxes collected by the State out of which Allah has fixed for them a share.\nWith this amount they provide for their requirements, maintain themselves and their arms in\nsound position to defend the religion and the cause of justice.\nThe army and the common men (common citizens who pay taxes or tributes) are two\nimportant classes, but in a Welfare State their well-being cannot be guaranteed without proper\nfunctioning and preservation of the other classes, the judges and magistrates, the secretaries of\nthe State and the officers of various departments who collect various revenues, maintain law\nand order as well as preserve peace and amity among the diverse classes of the society. They\nalso guard the rights and privileges of the citizens and look to the performances of various\nduties by individuals and classes. And the prosperity of this whole set-up depends upon the\ntraders and industrialists. They act as a medium between the consumers and the suppliers.\nThey collect the requirements of the society. They exert to provide goods. They open up\nshops, markets and trading centres. Thus providing the consumers with their necessities, they\nrelieve the citizens of the need of running after their requisites of life.\nThen comes the class of the poor and the disabled persons. It is absolutely necessary that they\nshould be looked after, helped and well-provided for. The Merciful Allah has explained the\nways and means of maintaining and providing for each of these classes. And everyone of this\nclass has the right upon the ruler of the State that at least minimum necessities for its wellbeing\nand contented living are provided.\nRemember, Maalik that Almighty Allah will not absolve any ruler from his obligations unless\nhe sincerely tries his best to discharge his duties, invokes Allah to help him in their\nperformance, remains steadfast and diligent on the path of truth and justice and bears all this\nwhether the performance of these duties is congenial or hateful to him.\nSo far as the army is concerned its chief and commander should be a person who is most\nsincere and faithful to Allah, to the Holy Prophet (s) and to your Imam who is most pious,\nwho is famous for his forbearance, clemency and gentleness, who is neither short-tempered\nnor does he get angry quickly, who sympathetically treats sincere excuses and accepts\napologies, who is kind and compassionate with the weak, but severe against the strong and the\npowerful, who has no vindictiveness which might lead to violence or any inferiority complex\nor weak-mindedness which makes them helpless and dejected. To find and select such\npersons you should have contacts with pious and noble families with high ideals and exalted\ntraditions, families well-known for their bravery and courage and generosity and\nmagnanimity. They are the people who may be considered as sources of magnificence and\nsublimity of character and fountain-heads of piety and good deeds.\nWhen you have found and selected such persons then keep an eye over them and watch them\nas parents watch their children so that you may find out if there appears any change in their\nbehaviour. Treat them kindly and sympathetically. Do not grudge highest considerations to\nthem (if they rightly deserve) and do not refuse small mercies. This kind of treatment will\ncreate reciprocal tendencies in them and they will trust you and will be faithful to you. Under\nthe impression that you have paid enough attention to their major necessities and wants, do\nnot close your eyes to their minor requirements and needs because small favours often bear\nbetter fruits though careful attention to major necessities is very important. Among the\nmilitary officers those should receive your highest respect and consideration who pay most\nattention to the needs of the soldiers under their command who come forward to help the\nsoldiers with their personal means and property so that the soldiers may lead a happy and\ncontented life and may have full confidence of the future of their families and children.\nIf the soldiers are thus satisfied and are free from anxieties and care then they will bravely and\nwholeheartedly face the conflicts. Your constant attention towards the officers and soldiers\nwill make them love you more and more.\nThe thing which should most gladden the heart of a ruler is the fact that his State is being\nruled on the principles of equity and justice and that his subjects love him. And your subjects\nwill only love you when they have no grievance against you. Their sincerity and loyalty will\nbe proved if they gather around you to support your government, when they accept your\nauthority without considering it an unbearable burden on their heads and when they do not\nsecretly wish your rule to come to an end. So let them have as many justifiable hopes in you\nas they can and fulfil as many as you reasonably can. Speak well of those who deserve your\npraise. Appreciate the good deeds done by them and let these good actions be known publicly.\nThe correct and timely publicity of noble actions and golden deeds creates more zeal in the\nminds of the brave and emboldens the cowards and the weaklings. You must know and\nrealize the good deeds done by every single individual so that the credit of noble deeds done\nby one may not be given to another. Do not underestimate and underpay the good work done.\nSimilarly do not overpay a work simply because it has been done by a very important person\nand do not let his position and prestige be the cause of overvaluation of the merit of his work\nand at the same time do not undervalue a great deed if it is done by a very ordinary person or\na commoner. Let equity, justice and fairplay be your motto.\nWhen you are faced with problems which you cannot solve or with a difficult situation from\nwhich you cannot escape or when uncertain and doubtful circumstances confuse and perplex\nyou, then turn to Allah and the Holy Prophet (s) because Allah has thus ordered those whom\nHe wants to guide. The way to turn to Allah is to act diligently according to the clear and\nexplicit orders given in His Holy Book and to the turn to the Holy Prophet (s) means to follow\nthose of his orders about which there is no doubt and ambiguity and which have been\ngenerally accepted to be correctly recorded.\nSo far as dispensing of justice is concerned, you have to be very careful in selecting officers\nfor the same. You must select people of excellent character and high calibre and with\nmeritorious records. They must possess the following qualifications: Abundance of litigations\nand complexity of cases should not make them lose their temper.\nWhen they realize that they have committed a mistake in judgement they should not insist on\nit by trying to justify it. When truth is made clear to them or when the right path opens up\nbefore them, they should not consider it below their dignity to correct the mistake made or to\nundo the wrong done by them. They should not be corrupt, covetous or greedy. They should\nnot be satisfied with ordinary enquiry or scrutiny of a case, but should scrupulously go\nthrough all the pros and cons, they must examine every aspect of the problem carefully, and\nwhenever and wherever they find doubtful and ambiguous points, they must stop, go through\nfurther details, clear the points, and only then proceed with their decisions. They must attach\nthe greatest importance to reasoning, arguments and proofs. They should not get tired of\nlengthy discussions and arguments. They must exhibit patience and perseverance in scanning\nthe details, in testing the points presented as true, in sifting facts from fiction and when truth\nis revealed to them they must pass their judgements without fear, favour or prejudice.\nThey should not develop vanity and conceit when compliments and praises are showered\nupon them. They should not be mislead by flattery and cajolery. But unfortunately they are\nfew persons having such characteristics. After you have selected such men to act as your\njudges, make it a point to go through some of their judgements and to check their\nproceedings. Pay them handsomely so that their needs are fully satisfied and they are not\nrequired to beg or borrow or resort to corruption. Give them such a prestige and position in\nyour State that none of your courtiers or officers can overlord them or bring harm to them. Let\njudiciary be above every kind of executive pressure or influence, above fear or favour,\nintrigue or corruption. Take every particular care of this aspect because before your\nappointment this State was under the sway of corrupt, time-serving and wealth-grasping\nopportunists who were lewd, greedy and vicious and who wanted nothing out of a State but a\nsinful consent of amassing wealth and pleasures for themselves.\nThen come the officers of your State. You must supervise their work. They must be appointed\nafter a careful scrutiny of their capabilities and characters. These appointments must be made\noriginally on probation without any kind of favouritism being shown or influence being\naccepted otherwise tyranny, corruption and misrule will reign in your State. While selecting\nyour officers take care to select experienced and honourable persons, members of respectable\nfamilies who had served Islam during its early days because these are usually of noble\ncharacter and good repute. They are not greedy and cannot be easily bribed. They mostly have\nbefore them the ultimate result of their thoughts and their deeds. Keep them also well-paid so\nthat they may not be tempted to lower their standard of morality and may not misappropriate\nthe cash of the State which they hold in their trust and if after being paid handsomely they\nprove dishonest, then you will be right to punish them. Therefore keep a careful watch over\ntheir system of work and rule.\nYou may also appoint trustworthy and honest men to keep a watch over the activities of these\nofficers. The knowledge that they are being watched secretly will keep them away from\ndishonesty, misrule, malpractice and tyrannizing the subjects. Protect your government from\ndishonest officers. If you find any of them dishonest and your confidential intelligence service\nsubmits acceptable proofs of his dishonesty, then you must punish him. This may be corporal\npunishment besides dismissal from service and taking back from him all which he has\ndishonestly collected. He must be humiliated and must be made to realize the infamy of his\nwicked deeds. His humiliation and punishment must be given publicly so that it may serve as\na lesson and a deterrent to others.\nSo far as collection of land revenues and taxes are concerned you must always keep in view\nthe welfare of the tax-payers which is of primary importance than the taxes themselves\nbecause these taxes and the tax-payers are the original sources on which the welfare of your\nState and its subjects depend.\nA State really lives upon the revenues collected from the tax-payers. Therefore, more\nimportance should be attached to the fertility of land than to the collection of taxes because\nactual taxable capacity of people rests upon the fertility of the land. The ruler, who does not\npay attention to the prosperity of his subjects and fertility of the land but concentrates only on\ncollection of revenues, lays waste the land and consequently ruins the State and brings\ndestruction to the creatures of Allah. His rule cannot last for long.\nIf the tax-payers complain to you of the heavy incidence to taxation, of any accidental\ncalamity, of the vagaries of the monsoons, of the recession of the means of irrigation, of\nfloods or destruction of their crops on account of excessive rainfall and if their complaints are\ntrue, then reduce their taxes. This reduction should be such that it provides them opportunities\nto improve their conditions and eases them of their troubles.\nDecrease in State-income due to such reasons should not depress you because the best\ninvestment for a ruler is to help his subjects at the time of their difficulties. They are the real\nwealth of a country and any investment on them even in the form of reduction of taxes, will\nbe returned to the State in the shape of the prosperity of its cities and improvement of the\ncountry at large. At the same time you will be in a position to command and secure their love,\nrespect and praises along with the revenues. Will that not be a lasting happiness?\nNot only this, but your benign rule and humane treatment will so affect them that they will\ncome to your help at the time of your difficulties and you will be able to rely on their support.\nYour kindness, your clemency and your justice will be a kind of moral training to them, and\nthe contented, happy and prosperous life, for which they will be grateful to you, will be the\nbest support, strongest protection and the greatest treasury for you.\nLater if such circumstances arrive that you find yourself in need of their support, their help,\ntheir confidence, their wealth and their man-power, then they will have no grudge against you.\nRemember, Maalik! If a country is prosperous and if its people are well-to-do then it will\nhappily and willingly bear any burden.\nThe poverty of the people is the actual cause of the devastation and ruination of a country and\nthe main cause of the poverty of the people is the desire of its ruler and officers to amass\nwealth and possessions whether by fair or foul means. They are afraid of losing their posts or\npositions and sway or rule and want to make the most during the shortest time at their\ndisposal. They never learn any lesson from the history of nations and never pay any attention\nto the commands of Allah.\nYou will also have to be very careful about your secretaries. You should entrust your work\nonly to those who are the best among them.\nSpecially the affairs which are of confidential nature and which deal with secrets, and the\nsecurity of the State should be entrusted only to men of noble character because men who are\nintoxicated with power, position and prestige carry on propaganda and speak against the\ngovernment in public, they openly misbehave with you and consider themselves so important\nas to ignore you or your orders in financial transactions essential to the State, they avoid\nplacing necessary papers before you or attending to important correspondence.\nParticular care should be taken that when the officers make contracts on behalf of the\ngovernment or sign agreements, these contracts and agreements are not defective or harmful\nto the State, if they are negotiating any treaties and alliances they do not overlook or forsake\nthe interests of the State or if they find the State in a weak and embarrassing position on\naccount of unfavourable terms of treaties or due to intrigues, they should be able to find\nsensible ways out of them. See that they know and realize their proper place and rank,\nbecause he who does not realize his place and position will never understand those of others.\nOne more thing about these officers: You must remember not to select them for very\nimportant posts and not to trust them completely simply because you have found them honest,\ndiligent, trustworthy and intelligent and have formed a good opinion about them because\nthere are some people who, when it suits them, pretend honesty, diligence and fidelity and can\nput on the garb of piety and virtue and thus find their ways in the hearts of the rulers, though\nactually they are neither honest nor diligent nor wise nor sagacious. Therefore, you must\nalways look to the record or reputation of the services of such men during previous regimes;\nmore importance should be attached to their good reputation. This kind of selection and\nsupervision will prove that you are faithful to Allah and that you wish your Imam well.\nThus you must appoint one officer as the Head of each important branch of your government.\nHe should have knowledge and wisdom enough to cope successfully with all the intricate\nproblems of his department and should be diligent enough to cope with extensive work.\nRemember well that if there is any defect in your officers and you are tolerating it, then you\nand only you are responsible for all those evils.\nI want to advise you about your businessmen and industrialists. Treat them well, and order\nyour officers to follow the same policy.\nThere may be local businessmen carrying on their trade in certain places or those who send\ntheir merchandise from one place to another. There may even be those who import and export\ngoods. Similarly there may be industrialists and manufacturers as well as industrial labour or\nmen engaged in the handicrafts. They all deserve sympathy, protection and good treatment.\nThey all are the sources of wealth to the country. They provide goods for the consumers.\nMost of these traders carry and convey these goods from across deserts, seas and over open\nlands and mountains, their consignments are brought from distant lands, often from places\nwhich are not easy to approach and where usually people do not care or do not dare to go.\nThese businessmen are usually peace-loving people, not given to mischievous disturbances\nand seditious fomentation. You must look after their interest and protect them whether they\nare trading in your cities or towns or whether they are travelling over the countries carrying\ngoods from place to place.\nOne more thing about these traders and industrialists. While treating them most\nsympathetically you must keep an eye over there activities as well.\nYou know they are usually stingy misers, intensely self-centered and selfish, suffering from\nthe obsession of grasping and accumulating wealth.\nThey often hoard their goods to get more profit out of them by creating scarcity and by\nindulging in black-marketing. Such a condition is extremely injurious to the public on one\nhand and disgraceful to the ruler on the other.\nYou must put a stop to all such practices because the Holy Prophet (s) has explicitly\nprohibited such practices. Remember that trade should go on between the buyers and sellers\naccording to correct measures and weights and on such reasonable terms that neither the\nconsumers nor the suppliers should have to face losses. But even with all the sympathetic\ntreatments accorded to them and with all the facilities provided to them, if the traders and\nindustrialists carry on hoarding and black-marketing, then you must punish them according to\nthe intensity of their crime.\nThen I want to caution you about the poor. Fear Allah about their conditions and you attitude\ntowards them. They have no support, no resources and no opportunities. They are poor, they\nare destitute and many of them are cripples and unfit for work. Some of them come out\nbegging and some (who maintain self-respect) do not beg, but their conditions speak of their\ndistress, poverty, destitution and wants. For the sake of Allah, Maalik, protect them and their\nrights. He has laid the responsibility of this upon your shoulders. You must fix a share for\nthem from Baytul Mal (the Government Treasury). Besides this reservation in cash, you must\nalso reserve a share in kind of crops etc. from government granaries in cities where foodgrains\nare stored as are cultivated on State-owned land because in these storage the share of\nthose living far away from any particular city is equal to the share of those living nearby.\nLet me remind you once again that you are made responsible for guarding the rights of the\npoor people and for looking after their welfare. Take care that the conceit of your position and\nvanity of wealth may not deceive you to lose sight of such a grave and important\nresponsibility. Yours is such an important post that you cannot claim immunity from the\nresponsibility of even minor errors of commission or omission with an excuse that you were\nengrossed in the major problems of the State which you have solved diligently.\nTherefore, be very careful of the welfare of the poor people. Do not be arrogant and vain\nagainst them. Remember that you have to take particular care of those who cannot reach you,\nwhose poverty-stricken and disease-ridden sight may be hateful to you, and whom society\ntreats with disgust, detestation and contempt. You should be a source of comfort, love and\nrespect to them. Appoint a respectable, honest and pious person - a person who fears Allah\nand who can treat them honourably, order him to find out everything about them and to\nsubmit a report to you.\nThen treat these poor people in such a way that on the Day of Judgement you can plead your\ncase successfully before Allah because of all classes of your subjects this class deserves more\nof your attention, sympathy and fair-deal.\nThough everyone of these poor persons deserves your sympathy and you will have to do\njustice to His cause to achieve His favour, yet you should pay more attention to young\norphans and old cripples. They neither have any support nor can they conveniently come out\nbegging. They cannot reach you; therefore, you must reach them.\nRemember that the fulfillment of this obligation and duty is considered as a tiresome burden\nby most of the rulers but to those who desire to achieve His Blessings and to enter into His\nRealm, even this work seems light and congenial. They bear it happily, dutifully and\nsincerely. They find pleasures in it and they believe in the promise made by Allah.\nOut of your hours of work, fix a time for the complainants and for those who want to\napproach you with their grievances. During this time you should do no other work but hear\nthem and pay attention to their complaints and grievances. For this purpose you must arrange\npublic audience for them during this audience, for the sake of Allah, treat them with kindness,\ncourtesy and respect. Do not let your army and police be in the audience hall at such times so\nthat those who have grievances against your regime may speak to you freely, unreservedly\nand without fear.\nAll this is a necessary factor of your rule because I have often heard the Holy Prophet (s)\nsaying, \"That nation or regime, where that rights of the depressed, destitute and suppressed\nare not guarded and where the mighty and powerful persons are not forced to accede these\nrights, cannot achieve salvation\". You must remember that in those audiences the most\ncommon men will gather. therefore, if you find them misbehaving, becoming unmannerly or\nif you feel that their talk is irrelevant, tolerate them; do not be rude and do not insult them, so\nthat Allah may be kind and merciful to you and may reward you for obeying His commands\nexplicitly. Treat them courteously, hear their grievances patiently and if you are forced to\nreject their demands then reject them in such a way that your rejection may please them as\nmuch as your grants.\nThen there are certain duties which only you will have to perform and which none of your\nofficers can carry out. Among them are replies to the letters of your commissioners and\ngovernors and are beyond the jurisdiction or preview of your secretaries. If you find that your\nofficers are not attending as much to the complaints of the public as they should, then you\nshould personally attend to them. You must finish a day's work on that day only because each\nday will bring its own special work for you. Reserve your best time for prayers to Allah,\nthough every work of the State is the work of Allah, especially, if you are sincere and honest,\nand if your subjects are happy with your rule and are safe from your oppression.\nAmong those duties that you are to perform diligently must be your daily prayers. These\nshould be offered sincerely and persistently. You must fix times for this during days and\nnights. You must tax your bodily strength for this duty though it may tire you. Your\nobservance of prayers should be sincere and faultless and should neither be so long as to tire\nout those who follow you in these prayers nor so short as to be faulty and defective because\namongst those who follow you during the prayers, there may be some sick persons, while\nothers may have to attend to some important work. When the Holy Prophet (s) sent me to\nYemen I asked him how to lead the prayers. He advised me, \"Offer prayers like a weak and\nold person and be kind to the faithful\" (so that weak and old persons may follow your prayers\neasily and happily).\nYou must take care not to cut yourself off from the public. Do not place a curtain of false\nprestige between you and those over whom you rule. Such pretensions and show of pomp and\npride are in reality manifestations of inferiority complex and vanity. The result of such an\nattitude is that you remain ignorant of the conditions of your subjects and of the actual cases\nof the events occurring in the State.\nYou will fail to realize comparative importance of events taking place and may attach great\nsignificance to minor events and may slip over important facts, similarly you may attach\nimportance to mediocre or insignificant people and may ignore real men of consequence; and\nwhat is more, you may lose the power of distinction between good and bad and may take one\nfor the other or hopelessly mix up the two. After all a ruler is as much a human being as any\nother man and he may remain ignorant of facts of which his officers want to keep him in the\ndark (and on which the public may throw light). Thus truth may get mixed up with falsehood\nand may not be distinguished because there are no birthmarks on the forehead of truth that it\nmay be easily differentiated from falsehood, one has to search for facts and sift realities from\nfictions, only then can one reach the truth. Think for yourself, there are only two categories of\nrulers and you may belong to one of them.\nYou may either be a pious, sincere and diligent ruler, doing the right thing at the right\nmoment and following the principles of justice and equity and you may be protecting rights of\nothers and doing your best to fulfil your obligations, in that case why hide from the public,\nwhy draw a curtain around yourself! Or you may be a miser refusing to be generous to\nanyone, in that case people will gradually come to know of this trait of your character and\nwill gradually give up asking for favours from you but do not overlook the fact that most of\ntheir demands will have nothing to do with your private purse, they will be about the rights of\npeople, obligations of the State, complaints against the State, oppressions, and solicitations of\njustice, then why try to avoid hearing these requests!\nYou should never overlook the fact that around the rulers there usually are certain privileged\npersons (relatives and friends). They may often try to take advantage of their status and may\nresort to selfishness, intrigues, fraud, corruption and oppression. If you find such people\naround you then do away with them (however closely connected they may be with you),\nimmediately bring an end to the scandal and clear your surroundings of all such moral and\nspiritual filth.\nYou must never give lands in permanent lease with all proprietary and ownership rights to\nyour friends and relatives. You must never allow them to take possession of the source of\nwater-supply or lands which have special utility for the communes. If they get possession of\nsuch holdings they will oppress others to derive undue benefits and thus gather all the fruits\nfor themselves leaving for you a bad reputation in this world and punishment in the next.\nBe fair in dispensing justice. Punish those who deserve punishment even though he may be\nyour near relation or a close friend and even if such an action may give you pangs of sorrow\nand grief. Bear such a sorrow patiently and hope for Divine reward. I assure you this will bear\ngood fruits.\nIf on account of your strict measures people get suspicious of your behaving like a tyrant and\noppressor, then come out openly before them and explain to them the reasons of your actions\nand let them see the facts for themselves and realize the truth. This will give training to your\nmind, will be an act of kindness to the subjects and the confidence thus reposed in them will\nmake them support justice and truth while you will achieve the end you have in view of\nobtaining their support in the cause of truth.\nIf your enemy invites you to a Peace Treaty that will be agreeable to Allah, then never refuse\nto accept such an offer because peace will bring rest and comfort to your armies, will relieve\nyou of anxieties and worries, and will bring prosperity and affluence to your people. But even\nafter such treaties be very careful of the enemies and do not place too much confidence in\ntheir promises because they often resort to Peace Treaty to deceive and delude you and take\nadvantage of your negligence, carelessness and trust. At the same time be very careful, never\nbreak your promise with your enemy, never forsake the protection or support that you have\noffered to him, never go back upon your words, and never violate the terms of the treaty. You\nmust even risk your life to fulfil the promises given and the terms settled because of all the\nobligations laid by Almighty Allah upon man (in respect to other men) there is none so\nimportant as to keep one's promises when made.\nThough people may differ in their religions and ideologies and may have divergent views\nupon various problems of State, yet they all agree that promises when made must be fulfilled.\nEven the heathens take care to keep the promises made among themselves because they have\nseen and realised the evil effects of breaking promises. Therefore, take very particular care of\npromises made, never go back upon the words given, never go into the offensive without\npreviously challenging and giving an ultimatum. Deception and fraud even against your\nenemy is a deception against Allah and none but a wretched sinner would dare do that.\nAllah has given promises and treaties the high rank of being messengers of peace and\nprosperity and through His Kindness and Mercy has made them a common desire (of keeping\npromises) in the minds of all men and a common requirement for all human beings. He has\nmade them such a shelter and asylum that everybody desires to be under their protection.\nTherefore, there should be no mental reservation, no fraud, no deception and no underlying\nmeanings in between the lines when you make a promise or conclude a treaty. Do not use\nsuch words and phrases in your promises and treaties as have possibilities of being translated\nin more than one way or as may have various interpretations and many explanations, let there\nbe no ambiguity in them, and let them be clear, precise and to the point. And when once a\ntreaty has been finally concluded, do not try to take advantage of any ambiguous word or\nphrase in it. If you find yourself in a critical situation on account of the treaty made in the\ncause of Allah, then try to face the situation and bear the consequences bravely and do not try\nto back out of the terms that account, because to face such perplexing situations as may gain\nHis Rewards and Blessings is better than to break your promises on that account and earn that\nabout which you feel nervous and for which you will have to answer Allah and which may\nbring down His Wrath upon you in this world and damnation in the next.\nBeware of the sin of shedding blood without religious justification and sanction because there\nis nothing quicker to bring down the Wrath of Allah, to take away His Blessings, to make you\nmore deserving of His Wrath and to reduce the span of your life than to shed innocent blood.\nOn the Day of Judgement Allah will first attend to sins of bloodshed carried out by man\nagainst man. Therefore, never try to strengthen your power, position and prestige by shedding\ninnocent blood. Such murders instead of making your position strong will not only\nconsiderably weaken it but may also transfer your power totally, taking it away from you and\nentrusting it to somebody else.\nIf you have intentionally murdered a man then no excuse shall be acceptable to Allah or to me\nbecause punishment of such a crime is necessary.\nAnd if you kill a man by mistake without any intention or motive of killing or while\ndelivering legal penalties, your whip, sword or hand unintentionally and inadvertently deals a\nfatal blow because even a forcefully delivered slap or box on the ear may cause death, then do\nnot, on account of your prestige and position, refuse paying the compensation to the heirs.\nBeware and do not develop the trait of self-admiration and self-appreciation. Do not get\nconceited of the good points that you find in your good character or good deeds that you have\ndone. Do not let flattery and cajolery make you vain and egoist. Remember that of all the\ncunning ruses of the devil to undo good deeds of the pious people and to affect their piety,\nflattery and false praises are the ones on which it relies the most.\nDo not boast of the favours and kindnesses that you have done to your subjects and do not try\nto make them realise this, do not think too much of the good that you have done to them, and\ndo not go back upon the promises made, all these three habits are very ugly features of one's\ncharacter. The practice of boasting over the favours done undoes the good done, the habit of\nexaggerating and thinking very highly of our good actions will make us lose the guidance of\nAllah, and the habit of breaking one's promises is disliked both by Allah and by man. The\nMerciful Allah says, \"It is most hateful in the sight of Allah, to say something and not to\npractice it.\""}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_61.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_61.md","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/letters/letter_62","_dir":"letters","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Letter 62","description":"Qur'an, 61:3","body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":".\nDo not be hasty and do not precipitate your decisions and actions, when the time comes for an\naction to be done, or a decision to be taken, then do not be lazy and do not waste time and do\nnot show weakness.

The reason was that we accepted and preached Islam and you remained heathen. The\ncondition now is that we are faithful and staunch followers of Islam and you have revolted\nagainst it. Even your original acceptance was not sincere, it was simple hypocrisy. When you\nsaw that all the big people of Arabia had embraced Islam and had gathered under the banner\nof the Holy Prophet (s) you also walked in (after the Fall of Makkah.)\nIn your letter you have falsely accused me of killing Talha and Zubayr, driving Ummul\nMu'minin Aisha from her home at Madina and choosing Kufa and Basra as my residence.\nEven if all that you say against me is correct you have nothing to do with them, you are not\nharmed by these incidents and I have not to apologize to you for any of them.\nYou have threatened that you are coming out to fight against me with a large horde of\nMuhajirs and Ansar. Do tell me who these Muhajirs are? The door of Hegira (Migration of\nMuslims to save their lives from the hands of unbelievers of Quraysh) was already closed on\nthe day your elder brother, Yazid bin Abi Sufyan was taken prisoner and Makkah was\nsurrendered by your father and the process of migration had ceased as soon as your paganism\nceased.

I may come out\nmyself to meet you which will be a correct gesture on my part because Allah may have\ndestined me to punish you for your inequities. And if you take the initiative to come out to\nfight, then it would mean, as a poet of Bani Asad has said \"They are facing those furious\nsummer winds which shower sand, rubble and gravel-stones\". Remember that I still hold the\nsword which has sent your maternal grandfather, maternal uncle and your brother to the same\nresting-place, the Hell.\nBy Allah, I know you too well to argue with you or to advise you. Apostasy and\navariciousness have taken a firm hold of your mind, your intelligence is of inferior order and\nyou cannot differentiate what in the end is good for you and what is not.\nIt is correct to say about you that you have risen to such dangerous and sinful heights that\nyour fall which is inevitable will lead to an eternal damnation because you are coveting a\nthing which morally does not belong to you and for which you are religiously most unsuitable\nand with which you have neither sincere affection nor any affinity or propensity. It had been\nonce usurped from the right person and you now want to retain it for yourself.\nHow great is the difference between your words and deeds? How much you resemble your\nmaternal and paternal uncles, whose ill-luck persuaded them to deny and repudiate the Holy\nProphet (s) and to fight against him and everyone of whom was at last doomed to die. You\nknow very well that they could not protect themselves or protect the cause they were\nchallenging to men who were energetic and brave and were present in every battlefield to\ndefend the cause of Islam.\nYou have also written so much about the murderers of Caliph Uthman. The correct thing for\nyou to do is to take the oath of allegiance to me as others have done and present the case in\nmy court of justice and then I shall pass my judgement according to the tenets of the Holy\nQur'an.

But this whole world is going to end and every individual\nhas to leave it some day or the other.\nKeeping in mind the Might of Allah, be particularly careful not to swear by Him unless you\nare taking an oath for a true and lawful affair. Always remember death and the life after death\nbut never wish for death. If you want to face death then do it for a great cause.\nTry to avoid all those things which a man may like for himself and may grudge for others.\nAbstain from an action which you will have to do covertly and secretly and which you feel\nashamed to do openly. Refrain from a deed which you will have to accept as evil or bad or for\nwhich you will have to tender an apology or excuse.\nDo not acquire a bad reputation and do not allow your good reputation to be sullied. Do not\nmention hearsay things as authenticated facts, such a practice will be sufficient for you to be\nregarded by others as liar. Do not develop the habit of contradicting and falsifying others on\nevery occasion, it is a disgusting habit.\nHave a control on your temper. If you have power to retaliate, then forgive and forget. When\nin anger, be forbearing, patient and tolerant. When you are in possession of wealth, power and\nauthority, then be forgiving, merciful and compassionate. These traits will help you to gain\nyour salvation.\nBe sincerely thankful for all the Blessings which the Merciful Allah has granted you, pray for\ntheir continuance, do not misuse them and do not waste them and you must show by your\ndeeds the extent of your obligations to Him for His Blessings.\nRemember that among the faithful Muslims the best is he who gives out alms and charities on\nhis on behalf and on behalf of his family and his property. Whatever you spend in this way is\nsomething that you send in advance for your life after death. You will then receive the reward\nof such deeds.

Avoid\nplaces where time is wasted in pastimes and amusements, where there are concentrations of\nignorant people and where you find scarcity of companions or lack of society and\nsurroundings to carry on your religious functions.\nKeep yourself busy with your work and do not frequent abodes meant for vicious pursuits\nbecause they are centres of the activities of Satan and the places which spread vice and\nwickedness.\nAlways look to the conditions of people not so well off as you are because observation of\ntheir lives and positions will make you more content with your lot in life and more thankful to\nAllah for it.\nNever start on a travel on Fridays without attending Friday prayers unless you are going out\nfor Jihad or there is no alternative for you but to set out.\nIn all of your affairs keep the thought of Allah in your mind and act according to His\nCommands and interdictions because obedience to His Orders has priority over every other\nthing. By various means and in various ways persuade yourself towards prayers but do not be\nhard with yourself, be gentle and persuasive. When you are free from other duties and you are\nhaving good health then spend your free hours in prayers. But the question of offering daily\nprayers (five times a day) is a different question.

Whoever persuades people to obey the orders of Allah\nprovides strength to the believers; whoever dissuades them from vices and sins humiliates the\nunbelievers; whoever struggles on all occasions discharges all his obligations and whoever\ndetests the vicious only for the sake of Allah, then Allah will take revenge on his enemies and\nwill be pleased with Him on the Day of Judgment."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There are four causes of infidelity and loss of belief in Allah: hankering after whims, a\npassion to dispute every argument, deviation from truth; and dissension, because whoever\nhankers after whims does not incline towards truth; whoever keeps on disputing every\nargument on account of his ignorance, will always remain blind to truth, whoever deviates\nfrom truth because of ignorance, will always take good for evil and evil for good and he will\nalways remain intoxicated with misguidance.

Therefore, remember carefully what I am telling you. Remember that\nthere are three kinds of people: one kind is of those learned people who are highly versed in\nthe ethics of truth and philosophy of religion, second is the kind of those who are acquiring\nthe above knowledge and the third is that class of people who are uneducated. They follow\nevery pretender and accept every slogan, they have neither acquired any knowledge nor have\nthey secured any support of firm and rational convictions. Remember, Kumayl, knowledge is\nbetter than wealth because it protects you while you have to guard wealth. It decreases if you\nkeep on spending it but the more you make use of knowledge the more it increases. What you\nget through wealth dis- appears as soon as wealth disappears but what you achieve through\nknowledge will remain even after you.\nO Kumayl ! Knowledge is power and it can command obedience. A man of knowledge during\nhis lifetime can make people obey and follow him and he is praised and venerated after his\ndeath. Remember that knowledge is a ruler and wealth is its subject.\nO Kumayl ! Those who amass wealth, though alive, are dead to realities of life, and those\nwho achieve know- ledge, will remain alive through their knowledge and wisdom even after\ntheir death, though their faces may disappear from the community of living beings, yet their\nideas, the knowledge which they had left behind and their memory, will remain in the minds\nof people\".\nKumayl says that after this brief dissertation, Imam Ali pointed towards his chest and said,\n\"Look Kumayl! Here I hold stores and treasures of knowledge. I wish I could find somebody\nto share it with me. Yes, I found a few, but one of them, though quite intelligent, was\nuntrustworthy, he would sell his salvation to get hold of the world and its pleasures, he would\nmake religion a pretence to grasp worldly power and wealth, he would make this Blessing of\nAllah (knowledge) serve him to get supremacy and control over friends of Allah and he\nwould through knowledge exploit and suppress other human beings. The other person was\nsuch that he apparently obeyed truth and knowledge, yet his mind had not achieved the true\nlight of religion, at the slightest ambiguity or doubt he would get suspicious of truth, mistrust\nreligion and would rush towards skepticism. So neither of them was capable of acquiring the\nsuperior knowledge that I can impart. Besides these two I find some other person One of them\nis a slave of self and greedy for inordinate desires, which can easily drag him away from the\npath of religion, the other is an avaricious, grasping and acquisitive miser who will risk his\nlife to grasp and hold wealth, none of these two will be of any use to religion or man, both of\nthem resemble beasts having appetite for food. If sensible trustees of knowledge and wisdom\ntotally disappear from human society then both knowledge and wisdom will suffer severely,\nmay bring harm to humanity and may even die out. But this earth will never be without those\npersons who will prove the universality of truth as disclosed by Allah, they may be wellknown\npersons, openly and fearlessly declaring the things revealed to them or they may,\nunder fear of harm, injury or deaths hide themselves from the public gaze and may carry on\ntheir mission privately so that the reasons proving the reality of truth as preached by religion\nand as demonstrated by His Prophet may not totally disappear. How many are they and where\ncould they be found? I swear by Allah that they are very few in number but their worth and\ntheir ranks before Allah are very high. Through them Allah preserves His Guidance so that\nthey, while departing, may hand over these truths to persons like themselves.
