Barring religious questions in all other matters\nconcerning your welfare, I should take you in my confidence and seek your advice, I should\nguard your interests and rights to the best of my ability, I should see that you are wellprotected\nand well-looked after and I should treat all of you equally without any favouritism.\nIf you receive such favourable treatment from me then it is your duty to thank Allah for His\nKindness. Your obedience to me is that you follow the orders given, be good and bravely face\ndifficulties to attain the right path.\nIf you cannot maintain this standard of fidelity and do not behave yourself then you will lose\nthe straight path of virtue and nobody will be lower in my eyes than you. I shall then punish\nyou severely.\nYou should make your subordinate officers promise to act accordingly and should give them\nthe same facilities and privileges as are given to you so that your affairs also run smoothly."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_57.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_57.md","_extension":"md"}
