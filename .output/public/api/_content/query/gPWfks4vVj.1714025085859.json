Do not feel sorry for those who have left you and have thus refused you their\nhelp and assistance.\nTheir turning of faces away from Allah and His Guidance and of stealthily walking over to\nsin and vice is enough proof of their apostasy and schism and enough reason for you to be\nthankful for good riddance of bad rubbish. These are worldly-minded people.\nThey are drawn towards the vicious world and are running fast after it.\nThey have heard (from the Holy Qur'an, the Holy Prophet (s) and Imam Ali (a)) what equity\nand justice mean, they have seen a just and equitable rule; they have recognized the\nimplications of these principles and they have fully realized how the use of these principles\nwill bring them in level with the commonest and poorest person of the country and how they\nwill be treated like every other human being.\nTherefore, they are rushing towards a society where corruption is at premium, where\nfavouritism holds sway and where justice and equity are abhorred.\nI swear by Allah that these people are not running away from injustice, inequity, oppression\nor tyranny, nor are they attaching themselves to truth, justice, equity and fair-play. I pray to\nAllah to ease the difficulties and remove the obstacles this exodus has created and make our\nwork easy for us."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_80.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_80.md","_extension":"md"}
