The aim in this is not\nto exhibit his correctness of thinking and judgement or deep\nsagacity but to show that there was unity and concord between him\nand the Caliphs so that attention should not be paid to the fact\nthat in some matters they also differed and that mutual clashes had\nalso occurred. History shows that Amir al-mu'minin did have\ndifferences of principles with the Caliphs and did not approve every\nstep of theirs. In the sermon of ash-Shiqshiqiyyah he has expressed\nin loud words his difference of opinion and anger about each regime.\nNevertheless, this difference does not mean that correct guidance\nshould be withheld in collective Islamic problems. Again, Amir\nal-mu'minin's character was so high that no one could imagine that\nhe would ever evade giving counsel which concerned the common weal,\nor would give such counsel which would damage public interests. That\nis why, despite differences of principle, he was consulted. This\nthrows light on the greatness of his character and the correctness\nof his thinking and judgement. Similarly, it is a prominent trait of\nthe Holy Prophet's character that despite rejecting his claim to\nprophethood the unbelievers acknowledged him the best trustee and\ncould never doubt his trustworthiness. Rather, even during clashes\nof mutual opposition they entrusted to him their property without\nfear and never suspected that their property would be\nmisappropriated. Similarly, Amir al-mu'minin was held to occupy so\nhigh a position of trust and confidence that friend and foe both\ntrusted in the correctness of his counsel. So, just as the\nProphet's conduct shows his height of trustworthiness, and just as\nit cannot be inferred from it that there was mutual accord between\nhim and the unbelievers, because trust has its own place while the\nclash of Islam and unbelief has another, in the same way, despite\nhaving differences with the Caliphs, Amir al-mu'minin was regarded\nas the protector of national and community interests and as the\nguardian of Islam's wellbeing and prosperity. Thus when national\ninterests were involved he was consulted and he tendered his\nunbiased advice raising himself above personal ends and keeping in\nview the Prophet's tradition to the effect that \"He who is\nconsulted is a trustee\" never allowed any dishonesty or duplicity\nto interfere. When on the occasion of the battle of Palestine, the\nCaliph `Umar consulted him about his taking part in it himself,\nthen, irrespective of whether or not his opinion would accord with\n`Umar's feelings, he kept in view Islam's prestige and existence\nand counselled him to stay in his place and to send to the\nbattlefront such a man who should be experienced and wellversed in\nthe art of fighting, because the going of an inexperienced man would\nhave damaged the established prestige of Islam and the awe in which\nthe Muslims were held which had existed from the Prophet's days\nwould have vanished. In fact, in the Caliph `Umar's going there\nAmir al-mu'minin saw signs of defeat and vanquishment. He therefore\nfound Islam's interest to lie in detaining him and indicated his\nview in the words that:"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n\"If you have to retreat from the battlefield, it would not be your\npersonal defeat only, but the Muslims would lose heart by it and\nleave the battle-field and disperse here and there, because with the\nofficer in command leaving the field the army too would lose ground.\nFurthermore, with the centre being without the Caliph there would be\nno hope of any further assistance from behind which could sustain\ncourage of the combatants.\""},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThis is that counsel which is put forth as a proof of mutual accord\nalthough this advice was tendered in view of Islam's prestige and\nlife which was dearer to Amir al-mu'minin than any other interest.\nNo particular individual's life was dear to him for which he might\nhave advised against participation in the\nbattle.]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-134","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 134"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2.sermons:134.
