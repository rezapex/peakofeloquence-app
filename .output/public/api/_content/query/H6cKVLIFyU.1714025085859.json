Allah has further ordered you to keep your desires under control, to keep yourself\nunder restraint when extravagant and inordinate yearnings and cravings try to drive you\ntowards vice and wickedness because usually your 'self' tries to incite and drag you towards\ninfamy and damnation unless the Merciful Lord comes to your help.\nLet it be known to you, Maalik, that I am sending you as a governor to a country which has\nseen many regimes before this. Some of them were benign, sympathetic and good, while\nothers were tyrannical, oppressive and cruel. People will judge your regime as critically as\nyou have studied the activities of other regimes and they will criticize you in the same way as\nyou have censured or approved other rulers.\nYou must know that a good and virtuous man is known and recognized by the good that is\nsaid about him and the praise which Allah has destined him to receive from others.\nTherefore, make your mind the source and fountain-head of good thoughts, good intentions\nand good deeds. This can only be attained by keeping a strict control on your desires and\nyearnings, however much they may try to incite and coerce you. Remember that the best way\nto do justice to your inner self and to keep it out of harm is to restrain it from vice and from\nthings which the 'self' inordinately and irrationally desires.\nMaalik! You must create in your mind kindness, compassion and love for your subjects. Do\nnot behave towards them as if you are a voracious and ravenous beast and as if your success\nlies in devouring them.\nRemember, Maalik, that amongst your subjects there are two kinds of people: those who have\nthe same religion as you have; they are brothers to you, and those who have religions other\nthan that of yours, they are human beings like you. Men of either category suffer from the\nsame weaknesses and disabilities that human beings are inclined to, they commit sins, indulge\nin vices either intentionally or foolishly and unintentionally without realizing the enormity of\ntheir deeds. Let your mercy and compassion come to their rescue and help in the same way\nand to the same extent that you expect Allah to show mercy and forgiveness to you.\nMaalik! You must never forget that if you are a ruler over them than the caliph is the ruler\nover you and Allah is the Supreme Lord over the caliph. And the reality is that He has\nappointed you as the governor and tested you through the responsibility of this rulership over\nthem.\nNever think of raising yourself to such a false prestige that you can declare war against Allah\nbecause you cannot ward off His Wrath and you can never be free from the need of His\nMercy and Compassion.\nDo not feel ashamed to forgive and forget. Do not hurry over punishments and do not be\npleased and do not be proud of your power to punish. Do not get angry and lose your temper\nquickly over the mistakes and failures of those over whom you rule.\nOn the contrary, be patient and sympathetic with them. Anger and desire of vengeance are not\ngoing to be of much help to you in your administration.\nNever say to yourself, \"I am their Lord, their ruler and all in all over them and that I must be\nobeyed submissively and humbly\" because such a thought will unbalance your mind, will\nmake you vain and arrogant, will weaken your faith in religion and will make you seek\nsupport of any power other than that of Allah . If you ever feel any pride or vanity on account\nof your sway and rule over your subjects then think of the supreme sway and rule of the Lord\nover the Universe, the extent of His creations, the supremacy of His Might and Glory, His\nPower to do things which you cannot even dream of doing and His control over you which is\nmore dominating than that which you can ever achieve over anything around you. Such\nthoughts will cure your mental weakness, will keep you away from vanity and rebellion\n(against Allah), will reduce your arrogance and haughtiness and will take you back to the\nsanity which you had foolishly deserted.\nTake care never to think of bringing yourself at par with Allah, never to think of matching\nyour power with Him and contesting His Glory and ever to pretend that you possess might\nand power like Him because the Mighty Lord will always humble pitiless tyrants and will\ndegrade all pretenders of His Power and Might.\nSo far as your own affairs or those of your relatives and friends are concerned take care that\nyou do not violate the duties laid down upon you by Allah and do not usurp the rights of\nmankind, be impartial and do justice to them because if you give up equity and justice then\nyou will certainly be a tyrant and an oppressor. And whoever tyrannizes and oppresses the\ncreatures of Allah, will earn enmity of Allah along with the hatred of those whom he has\noppressed; and whoever earns the Wrath of Allah loses all chances of salvation and he has no\nexcuse to offer on the Day of Judgement.\nEvery tyrant and oppressor is an enemy of Allah unless he repents and gives up oppression.\nRemember, Maalik! that there is nothing in this world more effective to turn His Blessings\ninto His Wrath quicker than to insist upon oppression over His creatures because the Merciful\nAllah will always hear the prayers of those who have been oppressed and He will give no\nchance to oppressors.\nYou must always appreciate and adopt a policy which is neither too severe nor too lenient, a\npolicy which is based upon equity will be largely appreciated. Remember that the displeasure\nof common men, the have-nots and the depressed persons more overbalances than the\napproval of important persons, while the displeasure of a few big people will be excused by\nthe Lord if the general public and the masses of your subjects are happy with you.\nRemember, Maalik! that usually these big personages are mentally the scum of the human\nsociety, they are the people who will be the worst drag upon you during your moments of\npeace and happiness, and the least useful to you during your hours of need and adversity, they\nhate justice the most, they will keep on demanding more and more out of the State resources\nand will seldom be satisfied with what they receive and will never be obliged for the favour\nshown to them if their demands are justifiable refused, they will never accept any reasonable\nexcuse or any rational argument and when the time changes, you will never find them\nstaunch, faithful and loyal.\nWhile the common men, the poor and apparently the less important section of your subjects\nare the pillars of Islam, they are the real assemblage of Muslims and the power and defensive\nforce against the enemies of Islam. Keep your mind on their affairs, be more friendly with\nthem and secure their trust and goodwill.\nBut be careful in forming your contacts (whether with the most important persons or the\ncommoners); keep such people away from you and think them to be the enemy of the State\nwho are scandal-mongers and who try to find fault with others and carry on propaganda\nagainst them because everywhere people have weaknesses and failings and it is the duty of\nthe government to overlook (minor) shortcomings. You must not try to go in search of those\nweaknesses which are hidden from you, leave them to Allah, and about those weaknesses\nwhich come to your notice, you must try to teach them how to overcome them. Try not to\nexpose the weaknesses of the people and Allah will conceal your own weaknesses which you\ndo not want anybody to know.\nDo not give cause to the people to envy each other (man against man, tribe against tribe or\none section of the society against the other). Try to alleviate and root out mutual distrust and\nenmity from amongst your subjects.\nBe fair, impartial and just in your dealings with all, individually and collectively and be\ncareful not to make your person, position and favours act as sources of malice. Do not let any\nsuch thing or such person come near to you who does not deserve your nearness and your\nfavour. Never lower your dignity and prestige.\nRemember that backbiters and scandal-mongers belong to a mean and cunning group, though\nthey pretend to be sincere advisers. Do not make haste to believe the news they bring and do\nnot heed to their advice.\nDo not accept the advice of misers, they will try their best to keep you away from acts of\nkindness and from doing good to others. They will make you frightened of poverty.\nSimilarly do not allow cowards to act as your advisers because they will make you timid in\nenforcing your orders, will scare you from handling important affairs boldly and will make\nyour enterprises and invasions timid and timorous attempts. At the same time avoid greedy\nand covetous persons who would aspire to the position of acting as your counsellor because\nhe will teach you how to exploit the community and how to oppress people to get their\nwealth. Remember that miserliness, cowardice and greed appear to be different wicked\nqualities but they all arise from the same evil mentality of having no faith and no trust in\nAllah.\nYour worst ministers will be the men who had been ministers to the despotic rulers before\nyou and who had been a party o atrocities committed by them. Such persons should not be\ntaken into your confidence and should not be trusted because they have aided sinners and\nhave assisted tyrants and cruel rulers.\nIn their stead you can comfortably find persons who are equally wise and learned but who\nhave not developed sinful and criminal mentalities, who have neither helped the tyrants in\ntheir tyrannies nor have they assisted them to carry on their sinful deeds. Such persons will\nprove the least troublesome to you. They will be the most helpful. They will sincerely\nsympathise with you. If you take them in your confidence they will sever their connections\nwith your opponents. Keep such people with you as your companions in your informal\ncompany as well as in official gatherings in audience. From amongst such honest and humane\ncompanions and ministers some would receive your fullest confidence and trust. They are\nthose who can always speak out the bitter truth to you and unreservedly and without fear of\nyour status, can refuse to assist you or associate with you in the deeds which Allah does not\nlike His good creatures to commit.\nSelect honest, truthful and pious people as your companions. Train them not to flatter you and\nnot to seek your favour by false praises because flattery and false praises create vanity and\nconceit and they make a man lose sight of his real self and ignore his duties.\nYou should not treat good and bad people alike because in this way you will be discouraging\ngood persons and at the same time emboldening the wicked to carry on their wickedness.\nEveryone should receive the treatment which his deeds make him deserve.\nTry carefully to realize that a ruler can create goodwill in the minds of his subjects and can\nmake them faithful and sincere to him only when he is kind and considerate to them, when he\nreduces their troubles, when he does not oppress them and when he never asks for things\nwhich are beyond their power.\nThese are the principles which you should keep in mind and act upon. Let your attitude be\nsuch that they do not lose faith in you because a good faith on their part will reduce many\ntroubles of administration and will relieve you of many worries and anxieties. And so far as\nyour confidence and trust is concerned, let it rest with those people whom you have tested in\ndifficulties and whom you have befriended, but you should always mistrust those people\nwhom you have wronged or who have proved themselves undeserving, inefficient or\nunfaithful.\nDo not give up those practices and do not break those rules which good Muslims have\nevolved or introduced before you, which have created unity and amity among the various\nsections of the society and which have benefited the masses.\nDo not break them and do not introduce innovations because if you do away with those good\nrules and traditions, the reward of having introduced them will go to those who evolved them\nand the punishment of having despoiled them will be your lot.\nYou must know, Maalik, that the people over whom you rule are divided into classes and\ngrades and the prosperity and welfare of each class of the society individually and collectively\nare so interdependent upon the well-being of the other classes that the whole set-up represents\na closely woven net and reciprocal aspect. One class cannot exist peacefully, cannot live\nhappily and cannot work without the support and good wishes of the other.\nAmongst them there are the soldiers of the army of Allah who defend His cause, the next\nclass is that of the secretaries of the State to whom duties of writing out and issuing special or\ngeneral orders are assigned, the third group is of the judges and magistrates to administer\njustice, the fourth is of officers who maintain law and order and guard the peace and\nprosperity of the country. Then there are common men, the Muslims who pay the taxes levied\nby the government, and non-Muslims who pay the taxes levied by the government, and non-\nMuslims who pay tribute to the State (in lieu of taxes). Then comes the class of men who\ncarry on various professions and trades and the last but not the least are the poor and the havenots\nwho are considered as the lowest class of the society. The Merciful Allah has fixed rights\nand duties of each one of them. They have been either mentioned in His Book or explained\nthrough the instructions of the Holy Prophet (s). A complete code of them is preserved with\nus.\nAs far as the soldiers are concerned, they are by the commands of Allah a fortress and\nstronghold to guard and defend the subjects and the State. They are the ornaments of the ruler\nand the country. They provide power and protection to the religion. They propagate and\npreserve peace among mankind. In fact, they are the real guardians of peace and through them\ngood internal administration can be maintained. The upkeep and maintenance of an army\ndepends upon the taxes collected by the State out of which Allah has fixed for them a share.\nWith this amount they provide for their requirements, maintain themselves and their arms in\nsound position to defend the religion and the cause of justice.\nThe army and the common men (common citizens who pay taxes or tributes) are two\nimportant classes, but in a Welfare State their well-being cannot be guaranteed without proper\nfunctioning and preservation of the other classes, the judges and magistrates, the secretaries of\nthe State and the officers of various departments who collect various revenues, maintain law\nand order as well as preserve peace and amity among the diverse classes of the society. They\nalso guard the rights and privileges of the citizens and look to the performances of various\nduties by individuals and classes. And the prosperity of this whole set-up depends upon the\ntraders and industrialists. They act as a medium between the consumers and the suppliers.\nThey collect the requirements of the society. They exert to provide goods. They open up\nshops, markets and trading centres. Thus providing the consumers with their necessities, they\nrelieve the citizens of the need of running after their requisites of life.\nThen comes the class of the poor and the disabled persons. It is absolutely necessary that they\nshould be looked after, helped and well-provided for. The Merciful Allah has explained the\nways and means of maintaining and providing for each of these classes. And everyone of this\nclass has the right upon the ruler of the State that at least minimum necessities for its wellbeing\nand contented living are provided.\nRemember, Maalik that Almighty Allah will not absolve any ruler from his obligations unless\nhe sincerely tries his best to discharge his duties, invokes Allah to help him in their\nperformance, remains steadfast and diligent on the path of truth and justice and bears all this\nwhether the performance of these duties is congenial or hateful to him.\nSo far as the army is concerned its chief and commander should be a person who is most\nsincere and faithful to Allah, to the Holy Prophet (s) and to your Imam who is most pious,\nwho is famous for his forbearance, clemency and gentleness, who is neither short-tempered\nnor does he get angry quickly, who sympathetically treats sincere excuses and accepts\napologies, who is kind and compassionate with the weak, but severe against the strong and the\npowerful, who has no vindictiveness which might lead to violence or any inferiority complex\nor weak-mindedness which makes them helpless and dejected. To find and select such\npersons you should have contacts with pious and noble families with high ideals and exalted\ntraditions, families well-known for their bravery and courage and generosity and\nmagnanimity. They are the people who may be considered as sources of magnificence and\nsublimity of character and fountain-heads of piety and good deeds.\nWhen you have found and selected such persons then keep an eye over them and watch them\nas parents watch their children so that you may find out if there appears any change in their\nbehaviour. Treat them kindly and sympathetically. Do not grudge highest considerations to\nthem (if they rightly deserve) and do not refuse small mercies. This kind of treatment will\ncreate reciprocal tendencies in them and they will trust you and will be faithful to you. Under\nthe impression that you have paid enough attention to their major necessities and wants, do\nnot close your eyes to their minor requirements and needs because small favours often bear\nbetter fruits though careful attention to major necessities is very important. Among the\nmilitary officers those should receive your highest respect and consideration who pay most\nattention to the needs of the soldiers under their command who come forward to help the\nsoldiers with their personal means and property so that the soldiers may lead a happy and\ncontented life and may have full confidence of the future of their families and children.\nIf the soldiers are thus satisfied and are free from anxieties and care then they will bravely and\nwholeheartedly face the conflicts. Your constant attention towards the officers and soldiers\nwill make them love you more and more.\nThe thing which should most gladden the heart of a ruler is the fact that his State is being\nruled on the principles of equity and justice and that his subjects love him. And your subjects\nwill only love you when they have no grievance against you. Their sincerity and loyalty will\nbe proved if they gather around you to support your government, when they accept your\nauthority without considering it an unbearable burden on their heads and when they do not\nsecretly wish your rule to come to an end. So let them have as many justifiable hopes in you\nas they can and fulfil as many as you reasonably can. Speak well of those who deserve your\npraise. Appreciate the good deeds done by them and let these good actions be known publicly.\nThe correct and timely publicity of noble actions and golden deeds creates more zeal in the\nminds of the brave and emboldens the cowards and the weaklings. You must know and\nrealize the good deeds done by every single individual so that the credit of noble deeds done\nby one may not be given to another. Do not underestimate and underpay the good work done.\nSimilarly do not overpay a work simply because it has been done by a very important person\nand do not let his position and prestige be the cause of overvaluation of the merit of his work\nand at the same time do not undervalue a great deed if it is done by a very ordinary person or\na commoner. Let equity, justice and fairplay be your motto.\nWhen you are faced with problems which you cannot solve or with a difficult situation from\nwhich you cannot escape or when uncertain and doubtful circumstances confuse and perplex\nyou, then turn to Allah and the Holy Prophet (s) because Allah has thus ordered those whom\nHe wants to guide. The way to turn to Allah is to act diligently according to the clear and\nexplicit orders given in His Holy Book and to the turn to the Holy Prophet (s) means to follow\nthose of his orders about which there is no doubt and ambiguity and which have been\ngenerally accepted to be correctly recorded.\nSo far as dispensing of justice is concerned, you have to be very careful in selecting officers\nfor the same. You must select people of excellent character and high calibre and with\nmeritorious records. They must possess the following qualifications: Abundance of litigations\nand complexity of cases should not make them lose their temper.\nWhen they realize that they have committed a mistake in judgement they should not insist on\nit by trying to justify it. When truth is made clear to them or when the right path opens up\nbefore them, they should not consider it below their dignity to correct the mistake made or to\nundo the wrong done by them. They should not be corrupt, covetous or greedy. They should\nnot be satisfied with ordinary enquiry or scrutiny of a case, but should scrupulously go\nthrough all the pros and cons, they must examine every aspect of the problem carefully, and\nwhenever and wherever they find doubtful and ambiguous points, they must stop, go through\nfurther details, clear the points, and only then proceed with their decisions. They must attach\nthe greatest importance to reasoning, arguments and proofs. They should not get tired of\nlengthy discussions and arguments. They must exhibit patience and perseverance in scanning\nthe details, in testing the points presented as true, in sifting facts from fiction and when truth\nis revealed to them they must pass their judgements without fear, favour or prejudice.\nThey should not develop vanity and conceit when compliments and praises are showered\nupon them. They should not be mislead by flattery and cajolery. But unfortunately they are\nfew persons having such characteristics. After you have selected such men to act as your\njudges, make it a point to go through some of their judgements and to check their\nproceedings. Pay them handsomely so that their needs are fully satisfied and they are not\nrequired to beg or borrow or resort to corruption. Give them such a prestige and position in\nyour State that none of your courtiers or officers can overlord them or bring harm to them. Let\njudiciary be above every kind of executive pressure or influence, above fear or favour,\nintrigue or corruption. Take every particular care of this aspect because before your\nappointment this State was under the sway of corrupt, time-serving and wealth-grasping\nopportunists who were lewd, greedy and vicious and who wanted nothing out of a State but a\nsinful consent of amassing wealth and pleasures for themselves.\nThen come the officers of your State. You must supervise their work. They must be appointed\nafter a careful scrutiny of their capabilities and characters. These appointments must be made\noriginally on probation without any kind of favouritism being shown or influence being\naccepted otherwise tyranny, corruption and misrule will reign in your State. While selecting\nyour officers take care to select experienced and honourable persons, members of respectable\nfamilies who had served Islam during its early days because these are usually of noble\ncharacter and good repute. They are not greedy and cannot be easily bribed. They mostly have\nbefore them the ultimate result of their thoughts and their deeds. Keep them also well-paid so\nthat they may not be tempted to lower their standard of morality and may not misappropriate\nthe cash of the State which they hold in their trust and if after being paid handsomely they\nprove dishonest, then you will be right to punish them. Therefore keep a careful watch over\ntheir system of work and rule.\nYou may also appoint trustworthy and honest men to keep a watch over the activities of these\nofficers. The knowledge that they are being watched secretly will keep them away from\ndishonesty, misrule, malpractice and tyrannizing the subjects. Protect your government from\ndishonest officers. If you find any of them dishonest and your confidential intelligence service\nsubmits acceptable proofs of his dishonesty, then you must punish him. This may be corporal\npunishment besides dismissal from service and taking back from him all which he has\ndishonestly collected. He must be humiliated and must be made to realize the infamy of his\nwicked deeds. His humiliation and punishment must be given publicly so that it may serve as\na lesson and a deterrent to others.\nSo far as collection of land revenues and taxes are concerned you must always keep in view\nthe welfare of the tax-payers which is of primary importance than the taxes themselves\nbecause these taxes and the tax-payers are the original sources on which the welfare of your\nState and its subjects depend.\nA State really lives upon the revenues collected from the tax-payers. Therefore, more\nimportance should be attached to the fertility of land than to the collection of taxes because\nactual taxable capacity of people rests upon the fertility of the land. The ruler, who does not\npay attention to the prosperity of his subjects and fertility of the land but concentrates only on\ncollection of revenues, lays waste the land and consequently ruins the State and brings\ndestruction to the creatures of Allah. His rule cannot last for long.\nIf the tax-payers complain to you of the heavy incidence to taxation, of any accidental\ncalamity, of the vagaries of the monsoons, of the recession of the means of irrigation, of\nfloods or destruction of their crops on account of excessive rainfall and if their complaints are\ntrue, then reduce their taxes. This reduction should be such that it provides them opportunities\nto improve their conditions and eases them of their troubles.\nDecrease in State-income due to such reasons should not depress you because the best\ninvestment for a ruler is to help his subjects at the time of their difficulties. They are the real\nwealth of a country and any investment on them even in the form of reduction of taxes, will\nbe returned to the State in the shape of the prosperity of its cities and improvement of the\ncountry at large. At the same time you will be in a position to command and secure their love,\nrespect and praises along with the revenues. Will that not be a lasting happiness?\nNot only this, but your benign rule and humane treatment will so affect them that they will\ncome to your help at the time of your difficulties and you will be able to rely on their support.\nYour kindness, your clemency and your justice will be a kind of moral training to them, and\nthe contented, happy and prosperous life, for which they will be grateful to you, will be the\nbest support, strongest protection and the greatest treasury for you.\nLater if such circumstances arrive that you find yourself in need of their support, their help,\ntheir confidence, their wealth and their man-power, then they will have no grudge against you.\nRemember, Maalik! If a country is prosperous and if its people are well-to-do then it will\nhappily and willingly bear any burden.\nThe poverty of the people is the actual cause of the devastation and ruination of a country and\nthe main cause of the poverty of the people is the desire of its ruler and officers to amass\nwealth and possessions whether by fair or foul means. They are afraid of losing their posts or\npositions and sway or rule and want to make the most during the shortest time at their\ndisposal. They never learn any lesson from the history of nations and never pay any attention\nto the commands of Allah.\nYou will also have to be very careful about your secretaries. You should entrust your work\nonly to those who are the best among them.\nSpecially the affairs which are of confidential nature and which deal with secrets, and the\nsecurity of the State should be entrusted only to men of noble character because men who are\nintoxicated with power, position and prestige carry on propaganda and speak against the\ngovernment in public, they openly misbehave with you and consider themselves so important\nas to ignore you or your orders in financial transactions essential to the State, they avoid\nplacing necessary papers before you or attending to important correspondence.\nParticular care should be taken that when the officers make contracts on behalf of the\ngovernment or sign agreements, these contracts and agreements are not defective or harmful\nto the State, if they are negotiating any treaties and alliances they do not overlook or forsake\nthe interests of the State or if they find the State in a weak and embarrassing position on\naccount of unfavourable terms of treaties or due to intrigues, they should be able to find\nsensible ways out of them. See that they know and realize their proper place and rank,\nbecause he who does not realize his place and position will never understand those of others.\nOne more thing about these officers: You must remember not to select them for very\nimportant posts and not to trust them completely simply because you have found them honest,\ndiligent, trustworthy and intelligent and have formed a good opinion about them because\nthere are some people who, when it suits them, pretend honesty, diligence and fidelity and can\nput on the garb of piety and virtue and thus find their ways in the hearts of the rulers, though\nactually they are neither honest nor diligent nor wise nor sagacious. Therefore, you must\nalways look to the record or reputation of the services of such men during previous regimes;\nmore importance should be attached to their good reputation. This kind of selection and\nsupervision will prove that you are faithful to Allah and that you wish your Imam well.\nThus you must appoint one officer as the Head of each important branch of your government.\nHe should have knowledge and wisdom enough to cope successfully with all the intricate\nproblems of his department and should be diligent enough to cope with extensive work.\nRemember well that if there is any defect in your officers and you are tolerating it, then you\nand only you are responsible for all those evils.\nI want to advise you about your businessmen and industrialists. Treat them well, and order\nyour officers to follow the same policy.\nThere may be local businessmen carrying on their trade in certain places or those who send\ntheir merchandise from one place to another. There may even be those who import and export\ngoods. Similarly there may be industrialists and manufacturers as well as industrial labour or\nmen engaged in the handicrafts. They all deserve sympathy, protection and good treatment.\nThey all are the sources of wealth to the country. They provide goods for the consumers.\nMost of these traders carry and convey these goods from across deserts, seas and over open\nlands and mountains, their consignments are brought from distant lands, often from places\nwhich are not easy to approach and where usually people do not care or do not dare to go.\nThese businessmen are usually peace-loving people, not given to mischievous disturbances\nand seditious fomentation. You must look after their interest and protect them whether they\nare trading in your cities or towns or whether they are travelling over the countries carrying\ngoods from place to place.\nOne more thing about these traders and industrialists. While treating them most\nsympathetically you must keep an eye over there activities as well.\nYou know they are usually stingy misers, intensely self-centered and selfish, suffering from\nthe obsession of grasping and accumulating wealth.\nThey often hoard their goods to get more profit out of them by creating scarcity and by\nindulging in black-marketing. Such a condition is extremely injurious to the public on one\nhand and disgraceful to the ruler on the other.\nYou must put a stop to all such practices because the Holy Prophet (s) has explicitly\nprohibited such practices. Remember that trade should go on between the buyers and sellers\naccording to correct measures and weights and on such reasonable terms that neither the\nconsumers nor the suppliers should have to face losses. But even with all the sympathetic\ntreatments accorded to them and with all the facilities provided to them, if the traders and\nindustrialists carry on hoarding and black-marketing, then you must punish them according to\nthe intensity of their crime.\nThen I want to caution you about the poor. Fear Allah about their conditions and you attitude\ntowards them. They have no support, no resources and no opportunities. They are poor, they\nare destitute and many of them are cripples and unfit for work. Some of them come out\nbegging and some (who maintain self-respect) do not beg, but their conditions speak of their\ndistress, poverty, destitution and wants. For the sake of Allah, Maalik, protect them and their\nrights. He has laid the responsibility of this upon your shoulders. You must fix a share for\nthem from Baytul Mal (the Government Treasury). Besides this reservation in cash, you must\nalso reserve a share in kind of crops etc. from government granaries in cities where foodgrains\nare stored as are cultivated on State-owned land because in these storage the share of\nthose living far away from any particular city is equal to the share of those living nearby.\nLet me remind you once again that you are made responsible for guarding the rights of the\npoor people and for looking after their welfare. Take care that the conceit of your position and\nvanity of wealth may not deceive you to lose sight of such a grave and important\nresponsibility. Yours is such an important post that you cannot claim immunity from the\nresponsibility of even minor errors of commission or omission with an excuse that you were\nengrossed in the major problems of the State which you have solved diligently.\nTherefore, be very careful of the welfare of the poor people. Do not be arrogant and vain\nagainst them. Remember that you have to take particular care of those who cannot reach you,\nwhose poverty-stricken and disease-ridden sight may be hateful to you, and whom society\ntreats with disgust, detestation and contempt. You should be a source of comfort, love and\nrespect to them. Appoint a respectable, honest and pious person - a person who fears Allah\nand who can treat them honourably, order him to find out everything about them and to\nsubmit a report to you.\nThen treat these poor people in such a way that on the Day of Judgement you can plead your\ncase successfully before Allah because of all classes of your subjects this class deserves more\nof your attention, sympathy and fair-deal.\nThough everyone of these poor persons deserves your sympathy and you will have to do\njustice to His cause to achieve His favour, yet you should pay more attention to young\norphans and old cripples. They neither have any support nor can they conveniently come out\nbegging. They cannot reach you; therefore, you must reach them.\nRemember that the fulfillment of this obligation and duty is considered as a tiresome burden\nby most of the rulers but to those who desire to achieve His Blessings and to enter into His\nRealm, even this work seems light and congenial. They bear it happily, dutifully and\nsincerely. They find pleasures in it and they believe in the promise made by Allah.\nOut of your hours of work, fix a time for the complainants and for those who want to\napproach you with their grievances. During this time you should do no other work but hear\nthem and pay attention to their complaints and grievances. For this purpose you must arrange\npublic audience for them during this audience, for the sake of Allah, treat them with kindness,\ncourtesy and respect. Do not let your army and police be in the audience hall at such times so\nthat those who have grievances against your regime may speak to you freely, unreservedly\nand without fear.\nAll this is a necessary factor of your rule because I have often heard the Holy Prophet (s)\nsaying, \"That nation or regime, where that rights of the depressed, destitute and suppressed\nare not guarded and where the mighty and powerful persons are not forced to accede these\nrights, cannot achieve salvation\". You must remember that in those audiences the most\ncommon men will gather. therefore, if you find them misbehaving, becoming unmannerly or\nif you feel that their talk is irrelevant, tolerate them; do not be rude and do not insult them, so\nthat Allah may be kind and merciful to you and may reward you for obeying His commands\nexplicitly. Treat them courteously, hear their grievances patiently and if you are forced to\nreject their demands then reject them in such a way that your rejection may please them as\nmuch as your grants.\nThen there are certain duties which only you will have to perform and which none of your\nofficers can carry out. Among them are replies to the letters of your commissioners and\ngovernors and are beyond the jurisdiction or preview of your secretaries. If you find that your\nofficers are not attending as much to the complaints of the public as they should, then you\nshould personally attend to them. You must finish a day's work on that day only because each\nday will bring its own special work for you. Reserve your best time for prayers to Allah,\nthough every work of the State is the work of Allah, especially, if you are sincere and honest,\nand if your subjects are happy with your rule and are safe from your oppression.\nAmong those duties that you are to perform diligently must be your daily prayers. These\nshould be offered sincerely and persistently. You must fix times for this during days and\nnights. You must tax your bodily strength for this duty though it may tire you. Your\nobservance of prayers should be sincere and faultless and should neither be so long as to tire\nout those who follow you in these prayers nor so short as to be faulty and defective because\namongst those who follow you during the prayers, there may be some sick persons, while\nothers may have to attend to some important work. When the Holy Prophet (s) sent me to\nYemen I asked him how to lead the prayers. He advised me, \"Offer prayers like a weak and\nold person and be kind to the faithful\" (so that weak and old persons may follow your prayers\neasily and happily).\nYou must take care not to cut yourself off from the public. Do not place a curtain of false\nprestige between you and those over whom you rule. Such pretensions and show of pomp and\npride are in reality manifestations of inferiority complex and vanity. The result of such an\nattitude is that you remain ignorant of the conditions of your subjects and of the actual cases\nof the events occurring in the State.\nYou will fail to realize comparative importance of events taking place and may attach great\nsignificance to minor events and may slip over important facts, similarly you may attach\nimportance to mediocre or insignificant people and may ignore real men of consequence; and\nwhat is more, you may lose the power of distinction between good and bad and may take one\nfor the other or hopelessly mix up the two. After all a ruler is as much a human being as any\nother man and he may remain ignorant of facts of which his officers want to keep him in the\ndark (and on which the public may throw light). Thus truth may get mixed up with falsehood\nand may not be distinguished because there are no birthmarks on the forehead of truth that it\nmay be easily differentiated from falsehood, one has to search for facts and sift realities from\nfictions, only then can one reach the truth. Think for yourself, there are only two categories of\nrulers and you may belong to one of them.\nYou may either be a pious, sincere and diligent ruler, doing the right thing at the right\nmoment and following the principles of justice and equity and you may be protecting rights of\nothers and doing your best to fulfil your obligations, in that case why hide from the public,\nwhy draw a curtain around yourself! Or you may be a miser refusing to be generous to\nanyone, in that case people will gradually come to know of this trait of your character and\nwill gradually give up asking for favours from you but do not overlook the fact that most of\ntheir demands will have nothing to do with your private purse, they will be about the rights of\npeople, obligations of the State, complaints against the State, oppressions, and solicitations of\njustice, then why try to avoid hearing these requests!\nYou should never overlook the fact that around the rulers there usually are certain privileged\npersons (relatives and friends). They may often try to take advantage of their status and may\nresort to selfishness, intrigues, fraud, corruption and oppression. If you find such people\naround you then do away with them (however closely connected they may be with you),\nimmediately bring an end to the scandal and clear your surroundings of all such moral and\nspiritual filth.\nYou must never give lands in permanent lease with all proprietary and ownership rights to\nyour friends and relatives. You must never allow them to take possession of the source of\nwater-supply or lands which have special utility for the communes. If they get possession of\nsuch holdings they will oppress others to derive undue benefits and thus gather all the fruits\nfor themselves leaving for you a bad reputation in this world and punishment in the next.\nBe fair in dispensing justice. Punish those who deserve punishment even though he may be\nyour near relation or a close friend and even if such an action may give you pangs of sorrow\nand grief. Bear such a sorrow patiently and hope for Divine reward. I assure you this will bear\ngood fruits.\nIf on account of your strict measures people get suspicious of your behaving like a tyrant and\noppressor, then come out openly before them and explain to them the reasons of your actions\nand let them see the facts for themselves and realize the truth. This will give training to your\nmind, will be an act of kindness to the subjects and the confidence thus reposed in them will\nmake them support justice and truth while you will achieve the end you have in view of\nobtaining their support in the cause of truth.\nIf your enemy invites you to a Peace Treaty that will be agreeable to Allah, then never refuse\nto accept such an offer because peace will bring rest and comfort to your armies, will relieve\nyou of anxieties and worries, and will bring prosperity and affluence to your people. But even\nafter such treaties be very careful of the enemies and do not place too much confidence in\ntheir promises because they often resort to Peace Treaty to deceive and delude you and take\nadvantage of your negligence, carelessness and trust. At the same time be very careful, never\nbreak your promise with your enemy, never forsake the protection or support that you have\noffered to him, never go back upon your words, and never violate the terms of the treaty. You\nmust even risk your life to fulfil the promises given and the terms settled because of all the\nobligations laid by Almighty Allah upon man (in respect to other men) there is none so\nimportant as to keep one's promises when made.\nThough people may differ in their religions and ideologies and may have divergent views\nupon various problems of State, yet they all agree that promises when made must be fulfilled.\nEven the heathens take care to keep the promises made among themselves because they have\nseen and realised the evil effects of breaking promises. Therefore, take very particular care of\npromises made, never go back upon the words given, never go into the offensive without\npreviously challenging and giving an ultimatum. Deception and fraud even against your\nenemy is a deception against Allah and none but a wretched sinner would dare do that.\nAllah has given promises and treaties the high rank of being messengers of peace and\nprosperity and through His Kindness and Mercy has made them a common desire (of keeping\npromises) in the minds of all men and a common requirement for all human beings. He has\nmade them such a shelter and asylum that everybody desires to be under their protection.\nTherefore, there should be no mental reservation, no fraud, no deception and no underlying\nmeanings in between the lines when you make a promise or conclude a treaty. Do not use\nsuch words and phrases in your promises and treaties as have possibilities of being translated\nin more than one way or as may have various interpretations and many explanations, let there\nbe no ambiguity in them, and let them be clear, precise and to the point. And when once a\ntreaty has been finally concluded, do not try to take advantage of any ambiguous word or\nphrase in it. If you find yourself in a critical situation on account of the treaty made in the\ncause of Allah, then try to face the situation and bear the consequences bravely and do not try\nto back out of the terms that account, because to face such perplexing situations as may gain\nHis Rewards and Blessings is better than to break your promises on that account and earn that\nabout which you feel nervous and for which you will have to answer Allah and which may\nbring down His Wrath upon you in this world and damnation in the next.\nBeware of the sin of shedding blood without religious justification and sanction because there\nis nothing quicker to bring down the Wrath of Allah, to take away His Blessings, to make you\nmore deserving of His Wrath and to reduce the span of your life than to shed innocent blood.\nOn the Day of Judgement Allah will first attend to sins of bloodshed carried out by man\nagainst man. Therefore, never try to strengthen your power, position and prestige by shedding\ninnocent blood. Such murders instead of making your position strong will not only\nconsiderably weaken it but may also transfer your power totally, taking it away from you and\nentrusting it to somebody else.\nIf you have intentionally murdered a man then no excuse shall be acceptable to Allah or to me\nbecause punishment of such a crime is necessary.\nAnd if you kill a man by mistake without any intention or motive of killing or while\ndelivering legal penalties, your whip, sword or hand unintentionally and inadvertently deals a\nfatal blow because even a forcefully delivered slap or box on the ear may cause death, then do\nnot, on account of your prestige and position, refuse paying the compensation to the heirs.\nBeware and do not develop the trait of self-admiration and self-appreciation. Do not get\nconceited of the good points that you find in your good character or good deeds that you have\ndone. Do not let flattery and cajolery make you vain and egoist. Remember that of all the\ncunning ruses of the devil to undo good deeds of the pious people and to affect their piety,\nflattery and false praises are the ones on which it relies the most.\nDo not boast of the favours and kindnesses that you have done to your subjects and do not try\nto make them realise this, do not think too much of the good that you have done to them, and\ndo not go back upon the promises made, all these three habits are very ugly features of one's\ncharacter. The practice of boasting over the favours done undoes the good done, the habit of\nexaggerating and thinking very highly of our good actions will make us lose the guidance of\nAllah, and the habit of breaking one's promises is disliked both by Allah and by man. The\nMerciful Allah says, \"It is most hateful in the sight of Allah, to say something and not to\npractice it.\""}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_61.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_61.md","_extension":"md"}
