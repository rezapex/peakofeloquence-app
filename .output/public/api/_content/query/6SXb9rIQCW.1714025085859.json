Seek the help of Allah in your difficulties and enterprises. In your\nbehaviour with your subjects remember that you should use leniency and tolerance alongside\nseverity. Be kind, tolerant and lenient as far as and as long as possible but when you feel that\nyour purpose cannot be achieved without severity only then can you adopt such an attitude.\nBut remember always to treat them sympathetically, kindly, courteously and to treat them\ncheerfully. While meeting them, talking to them and wishing everyone of them, whether rich\nor poor, big or small you should behave as if they are your equals so that important persons of\nyour State may not presume to derive undue advantage out of your uncalled for servile\nbehaviour and poor people may not lose hope in your justice and sympathy."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_53.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_53.md","_extension":"md"}
