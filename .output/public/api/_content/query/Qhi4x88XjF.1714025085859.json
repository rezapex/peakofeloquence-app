The possessions, the riches and the luxuries that you have surrounded\nyourself with, belong to this world, a world which has profusely decorated itself and which is\nbent upon alluring you with its enjoyments. It has enticed you away and you have fallen an\neasy prey to its allurements. It has dragged you and you have followed it like a tame animal\non the other end of the rope. It has ordered you and you have obeyed its orders submissively.\nYou have forgotten that shortly you will be called to bear the consequences of such a life;\nconsequences from which no one can shield, liberate or absolve you.\nAbstain from such a life, keep yourself ready for the Day of Judgement; be ready for death\nwhich is inevitable, bound to come and sure to end every life, rich or poor. Do not listen to\nthe exciting whispers of those who want to tempt you and do not make them believe that they\nand their heinous whisperings have any importance in your mind.\nIf you do not faithfully and sincerely follow the dictates of religion and do not act as I have\nadvised you, then I want to warn you of something that you have entirely forgotten. It is that\nyou are unthankful to Allah for all which He has granted to you and you are ungrateful to\nHim for the Favours bestowed upon you. Satan has taken possession of your soul. Its desire to\nsecure you as his obedient slave, is fully fulfilled. It has a firm hold on your mind.\nO Mu'awiya! Were you ever entrusted with the noble status of dispensing peace and justice to\nmankind? Have you the necessary knowledge for the work? Do you really know the canons of\nequity and justice as laid down by Islam? You and your ways of government! May Allah\nprotect me from and may withhold me from behaving towards mankind the way you have\nbehaved and from tyranny, exploitations and murders that you commit. Take care! You are\nbeing madly driven by the lust of wealth, power and vicious indulgence, you are behaving\nhypocritically against man and Allah. You shall be damned forever.\nYou have challenged me to a battle. I accept your challenge. But I have a proposal to make.\nWhy have a war involving murder and bloodshed of thousands of ignorant people? Why be a\nscourge to mankind? Let us have mercy on them, whether they are sincere and Allah-fearing\nMuslims, or ignorant, unenlightened and greedy mercenaries misguided and fooled by you.\nLet there be peace and tranquillity for all the creatures of Allah.\nLet us, you and I, have a single combat. Let it be a combat unto death. Let the soldiers of both\narmies stand aside and let two of us alone combat with each other. Let the world see and\nrealize who is the sinner and who has forgotten Allah and the Day of Judgement. Will you\naccept this invitation of mine? Have you the courage for it? Are you a man to face death\nboldly and bravely or are you merely a vampire sucking the blood of others surreptitiously?\nRemember Mu'awiya! Though now old I am still Abu al-Hasan, the man who killed your\nmaternal grandfather, your uncle and your brother in single combats in the Battle of Badr. The\nsame sword is still in my hand, the same blood is still flowing in my veins, the same heart is\nstill throbbing in my chest and with the same courage I still face my enemy. Will you come\nand face me alone?\nRemember that I have not introduced any innovation in religion, nor have I insinuated schism.\nVerily, I sincerely believe in the religion which you pretended to embrace hypocritically with\nmental reservations and pretensions, a religion which you in your heart of hearts actually\nhated and which you gave up quickly and cheerfully.\nYou pretend that you want to avenge the murder of Caliph Uthman. Do you know who\nactually killed him and who caused his murder? If really you do so, then seek vengeance on\nthem.\nI see before me the day when you will be tired of this war, when you will face defeat, when\nyou will find death or disgrace facing you, when I shall scatter your armies, killing your\nfamous but misguided marshals, when I shall thin your ranks and files; then in despondency\nand despair you will turn towards the Book of Allah, though you will have no faith in it and\nno belief in the truth preached by it because you and your followers being hypocrites have no\nfaith in Allah, in the Holy Prophet (s) and the Day of Judgement and who have gone back on\ntheir promises."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_10.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_10.md","_extension":"md"}
