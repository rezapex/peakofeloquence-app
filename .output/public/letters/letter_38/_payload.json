(What a prophecy!)\nLet it be known to you that decay of health, passing away of time and nearness of death, have\nmade me realize that I should give more thought to my future (next world) and to my people;\nadvise them more and spend more time in equipping them mentally to face this world.\nI felt that my own sons and my near ones have as much right to utilize my experiences and\nknowledge, all the ups and downs of life, all the realities and all the truths about life in this\nworld and in the Hereafter, which are as much known to me as others.\nI decided, therefore, to spend more time over you and to prepare you more for your. This was\nneither selfishness nor self-esteem nor any mental luxury of giving away pieces of advice, but\nit was the sincere desire of making you see the world as I found it, look at the realities of lives\nas I looked at them, and do the right thing at the right time and right place as it should be done\nwhich made me write down these exhortations to you.\nYou will not find in them anything but truth and realities.\nMy dear son! You are part of my body and soul and whenever I look at you I feel as if I am\nlooking at myself. If any calamities befalls you, I feel as if it has befallen me. Your death will\nmake me feel as if it was my own death. Your affairs are to me like my own affairs.\nTherefore, I committed these pieces of advice to paper. I want you to take care of them, to pay\nattention to them and to guard them well. I may remain longer in your life or I may not, but I\nwant these pieces of advice to remain with you always.\nMy first and foremost advice to you, my son, is to fear Allah. Be His obedient servant. Keep\nHis thought always fresh in your mind. Be attached to and carefully guard the principles\n(Islam) which connect you with Him. Can any other connection be stronger, more durable and\nmore lasting than this to command greater respect and consideration or to replace it?\nAccept good exhortations and refresh your mind with them. Adopt piety and kill your\ninordinate desires with its help. Build your character with the help of true faith in religion and\nAllah. Subjugate your nature with the vision of death, make it see the mortality of life and of\nall that it holds dear, force it to realize the actuality of misfortunes and adversities, the\nchanges of circumstances and times and compel it to study the lives of past people.\nPersuade it to see the ruined cities, the dilapidated palaces, decaying signs and relics of fallen\nempires of past nations. Then meditate over the activities of those people, what they have all\ndone when they were alive and were in power, what they achieved, from where they started\ntheir careers; where, when and how they were brought to an end, where they are now; what\nhave they actually gained out of life and what was their contributions to the human welfare.\nIf you carefully ponder over these problems, you will find that each one of those people has\nparted company with the others and with all that he cherished and loved and he is now in a\nsolitary abode, alone and unattended; and you also will be like him.\nTake care to provide well for your future abode. Do not barter away eternal blessing for\npleasures of this mortal and fleeting world.\nDo not talk about things which you do not know. Do not speculate about and pass verdicts on\nsubjects about which you are not in a position to form an opinion and are not called upon to\ndo so.\nGive up the way where there is a possibility of your going astray. When there is danger on\nyour wandering in the wilderness of ignorance, possibility of losing the sight of the goal\nwhich you want to attain and of reaching the end aimed at, then it is better to give up the quest\nthan to advance facing uncertain dangers and unforeseen risks.\nAdvise people to do good and to live virtuously because you are fit to give such advice. Let\nyour words and deeds teach the world lessons of how to abstain from wickedness and vicious\ndeeds. Try your best to keep away from those who indulge in vices and sins.\nFight, whenever required, to defend the cause of Allah. When you think of defending the\ncause of Allah do not be afraid that people will laugh at you, censure your action or slander\nyou. Fearlessly and boldly help truth and justice. Bear patiently the sufferings and face\nbravely the obstacles which come in your way when you follow truth and when you try to\nuphold it. Adhere to the cause of truth and justice wherever you find it. Try to be well versed\nwith Islamic Jurisprudence and theology and acquire a thorough knowledge of the canons of\nthis religion.\nDevelop the habit of patience against sufferings, calamities and adversities. This virtue of\npatience is one of the highest values of morality and nobility of character and it is the best\nhabit which one can develop. Trust in Allah and let your mind seek His protection in every\ncalamity and suffering because you will thus entrust yourself and your affairs to the Best\nTrustee and to the Mightiest Guardian. Do not seek help or protection from anybody but\nAllah.\nReserve your prayers, your requests, your solicitations, your supplications, and your entreaties\nto Him and Him alone because to grant, to give, to confer and to bestow, as well as to\nwithhold, to deprive, to refuse, and to debar, lies only in His Power. Ask as much of His\nBlessings and seek as much of His Guidance as you can.\nTry to understand my exhortation, ponder over them deeply; do not take them lightly and do\nnot turn away from them because the best knowledge is that which benefits the listener. The\nknowledge which does not benefit anybody is useless, not valuable and not worth learning\nand remembering.\nMy dear son! When I realized that I was getting old and when I felt that weakness and\nfeebleness are gradually creeping into me then I hastened to advise you as to the best ways of\nleading a noble, virtuous and useful life. I hated the idea that death should overtake me before\nI tell you all that I wanted to tell or before my mental capacities like my bodily strength are\nweakened. I convey all this to you lest inordinate desires, temptations and inducement should\nstart influencing you, or adverse changes of times and circumstances should drag your name\nin the mire or I should leave you like an untrained colt because a young and fresh mind is like\na virgin soil which allows things sown in it to grow verdantly and to bear luxuriantly.\nThen, I have made use of early opportunities to educate you and train you before your mind\nloses its freshness, before it gets hardened or warped, before you start facing life unprepared\nfor the encounter, and before you are forced to use your decisions and discretions without\ngaining advantages of cumulated traditions, collected knowledge and experiences of others.\nThese words of advice and counsels that I give you, will save you from the worry of acquiring\nknowledge, gathering experiences and soliciting advice from others. Now you can easily\nmake use of all the knowledge which men have to acquire with great care, trouble and\npatience. Things which were hidden from them and which only experiments, experiences and\nsufferings could bring to light are now made easily available to you through these\nexhortations.\nMy dear son! Though the span of my life is not as that of some other people who have passed\naway before me yet I took great care to study their lives, assiduously I went through their\nactivities, I contemplated over their deliberations and deeds, I studied their remains, relics and\nruins, I pondered over their lives so deeply that I felt as if I have lived and worked with them\nfrom early ages of history down to our times and I know what did them good and what\nbrought harm to them.\nSifting the good from bad I am concentrating within these pages, and for your good, the\nknowledge that I so gathered.\nThrough these pieces of advice I have tried to bring home to you the value of honest-living\nand high-thinking and the dangers of a vicious and sinful life, I have taken care to cover and\nguard every aspect of your life as it is the duty of a kind, considerate and loving father.\nFrom the very beginning, I took care to help you to develop a noble character and to fit you\nfor the life which you will have to lead, to let you grow up to be a young man with a noble\ncharacter, an open and honest mind and clear and precise knowledge of things around you.\nOriginally my desire was only to teach you the Holy Book thoroughly, to make you\nunderstand its intricacies, to impart to you the complete knowledge of His commandments\nand interdictions and not to leave you at the mercy of the knowledge of other people.\nBut after having succeeded in this task I felt nervous that I may leave you untrained and\nuneducated in the subjects which themselves are subject to so much confusion and so many\ncontradictions. These are the subjects whose confusions have been made worse confounded\nby selfish desires, warped minds, wicked ways of life and sinful modes of thinking.\nTherefore, I have noted down, in these lines, the basic principles of nobility, piety, truth and\njustice.\nYou may feel them to be over-bearing and harsh but my desire is to equip you with this\nknowledge instead of leaving you unarmed to face the world where there is every danger of\nloss and damnation.\nAs you are a noble, virtuous and pious young man, I am sure you will receive Divine\nGuidance and Succour. I am sure He will help you to achieve your aim in life. I want you to\npromise to yourself to follow my advice carefully.\nRemember my son! The best out of these pieces of advice of mine are the those which tell\nyou to fear Allah, to concentrate and to confine yourself to the performance of those duties\nwhich have been made incumbent upon you by Him and to follow in the footsteps of your\nancestors (The Holy Prophet (s) & Imam Ali (a)) and your pious and virtuous relationship.\nVerily, they always carefully measured their thoughts and deeds, as you must also try to do\nand they carefully thought over the subject before saying anything about it or before doing a\ndeed. You should also follow the same.\nThis kind of deliberation made them take from life what was really the best and forsake that\nwhich was not made incumbent upon them or which was not the best.\nIf your mind refuses to accept my advice and you persist to try your own experiments like\nthem then you are at liberty to arrive at your conclusions but only after thoroughly studying\nthe subject and after acquiring the knowledge necessary for such decisions.\nYou must not allow uncertainties and doubt poison your mind, scepticism or irrational likes\nand dislikes should not affect your views. But remember that before you start thinking and\ndeliberating over a problem seek guidance of the Lord and beseech Him to give you a lead in\nthe right direction.\nAvoid confusion in your ideas, and do not let disbelief take hold of your mind because the\nfirst will lead you to agnosticism and the others towards errors and sins. When you are thus\nprepared to solve any problem and you are sure that you possess a clear mind, a sincere and\nfirm desire to reach the truth, to say the correct thing and to do the correct deed, then carefully\ngo through the advice that I am leaving for you.\nIf your mind is not clear and it is not as free from doubts as you wish it to be, then you will be\nwandering in the wilderness of uncertainties and errors like a camel suffering from nightblindness.\nUnder these circumstances it is best for you to give up the quest because with such\nlimitations none can ever reach the truth.\nMy dear son! carefully and very carefully remember these sayings of mine. The Lord who is\nthe Master of death is also the Master of life. The Creator is the Annihilator. And the One\nwho annihilates has the power to bring everything back again to existence. The One who\nsends calamities has also the power to protect you from them.\nRemember that this world is working under the laws ordained by Him, and it consists of\nassemblage and aggregation of actions and reactions, causes and effects, calamities and\nreverses, pains and pleasures and rewards and punishments, but this is not all which the\npicture depicts, there are things in it which are beyond our ken, things which we do not and\ncannot know and things which cannot be foreseen and foretold, for example the rewards and\npunishments on the Day of Judgement. Under these circumstances, if you do not understand a\nthing, do not reject it. Remember that your lack of understanding is due to insufficiency of\nyour knowledge. Remember that when you came into this world your first appearance was\nthat of an ignorant, uneducated and unlearned being.\nThen you gradually acquired knowledge, but there were several things which were beyond\nyour knowledge, which perplexed and surprised you, and about which you did not\nunderstand. Gradually you acquired knowledge about some of those subjects and in future\nyour knowledge and vision may further expand.\nTherefore, the best thing for you to do is to seek guidance of One who has created you, Who\nmaintains and nourishes you, Who has given you a balanced mind and a normally working\nbody.\nYour invocations should be reserved for Him only, your requests and solicitations should be\nalone to Him and you should only be afraid of Him.\nBe it known to you, my son, that nobody has given mankind such detailed information about\nAllah as our Holy Prophet (s). I advise you to have faith in his teachings, to make him your\nleader and to accept his guidance for your salvation. Thus advising you I have done the best\nthat I can do as a sincere and loving adviser and I assure you that however you may try to find\na better way for your good, you will not find any superior to the one advised by me.\nRemember, my son, had there been any other god, besides the One, he would have also sent\nhis messengers and prophets and they would have pointed out to mankind the domain and\nglory of this second god, and you would have also seen them. But no such incident ever took\nplace. He is One Allah whom we should all recognize and worship. He has explained Himself.\nNobody is a partner to Him in His Domain, Might and Glory. He is Eternal, has always been\nand shall always be. He existed even before the Universe came into being but there is no\nbeginning to His Existence. He shall remain when every other thing shall vanish, and there\nshall be no end to His Existence. His Glory and His Existence is so supreme, pre-eminent,\ntranscendent, incomparable and excellent that it is beyond the grasp of intellects.\nNo one can understand or visualize Him.\nWhen you have accepted these facts then your behaviour, so far as His commands are\nconcerned, should be that of a person who realizes that his status, power and position is\nnothing when compared to that of His Lord; who wants to gain His Blessings through prayers\nand obedience, who fears His Wrath as well as His Punishments and who absolutely in need\nof His Help and Protection. Remember, my son, Allah has not ordered you to do anything but\nthat which is good and which propagates goodness and He has not prohibited you from\nanything but that which is bad and will bring about bad effects.\nMy dear son, through this message of mine, I have explained everything about this world,\nhow fickle and fleeting is its attitude, how short-lived and evanescent is everything that it\nholds or offers about and how fast it changes its moods and favours. I have also explained\nabout the life to come, the pleasures and blessings provided there, and the everlasting peace,\ncomfort and happiness arranged for in Paradise.\nI have given enough examples of both aspects of life, before and after death so that you may\nknow the reality and lead your life on the basis of that knowledge.\nAs a matter of fact those people who have carefully studied the condition of life and the\nworld, pass their days as if they know that they are travellers, who have to leave a place\nwhich is famine-stricken, unhealthy and uncongenial, and they have to proceed towards lands\nwhich are fertile, congenial, and where there is abundant provision of all comforts and\npleasures. They have eagerly taken up the journey, happy in the hope of future blessings and\npeace.\nThey have willingly accepted the sufferings, troubles and hazards of the way, parting of\nfriends, scarcity of food and comfort during the pilgrimage so that they may reach the\njourney's end - a happy place. They do not refuse to bear any discomfort and do not grudge\nany expenditure by way of giving out alms and charities, and helping the poor and the needy.\nEvery step which they put forward towards their goal, however tiring and exhausting it may\nbe, is a happy event of their lives. On the contrary the condition of those people who are\nsolely engrossed in this world and are sadly engulfed in its short-lived, quickly fading and\nvicious pleasures, is like that of travellers who are staying in fertile and happy regions and\nwho have to undertake a journey, knowing fully well that the journey is going to end in a\nrough, arid and infertile land.\nCan anything be more loathsome and abhorring to them than this journey? How they would\nhate to leave the place where they are and to arrive at a place which they so much hate and\nwhich is so dismaying, dreadful and horrifying!\nMy dear son, so far as your behaviour with other human beings is concerned, let your 'self' act\nas scales to judge its goodness or wickedness. Do unto others as you wish others to do unto\nyou.\nWhatever you like for yourself, like for others, and whatever you dislike to happen to you,\nspare others from such happenings. Do not oppress and tyrannize anybody because you surely\ndo not like to be oppressed and tyrannized. Be kind and sympathetic to others as you certainly\ndesire others to treat you kindly and sympathetically. If you find objectionable and loathsome\nhabits in others, abstain from developing those traits of character in yourself.\nIf you are satisfied or feel happy in receiving a certain kind of behaviour from others, you\nmay behave with others in exactly the same way.\nDo not speak about them in the same way that you do not like others to speak about you. Do\nnot speak on a subject about which you know little or nothing, and if you at all want to speak\non anything or about anyone of whom you are fully aware, then avoid scandal, libel and\naspersion as you do not like yourself to be scandalized and scorned in the same manner.\nRemember, son, that vanity and conceit are forms of folly. These traits will bring to you\nserious harm and will be a constant source of danger to you. Therefore, lead a well-balanced\nlife (neither be conceited nor suffer from inferiority complex) and exert yourself to earn an\nhonest living. But do not act like a treasure for somebody (do not be miserly so that you leave\nwhat you hoard for others). And whenever you receive guidance of the Lord to achieve a\nthing you desire, then do not get proud of your achievement but be humble and submissive to\nHim and realize that your success was due to His Mercy.\nRemember my son, that before you is a long and arduous journey (life). The journey is not\nonly very long, exhausting and onerous but the route is mostly through dismal, dreary and\ndeserted regions where you will be sadly in need of refreshing, renovating and enlivening aids\nand helps and you cannot dispense with such provisions as to keep you going and to maintain\nyou till the end of the journey - the Day of Judgement.\nBut remember not to overload yourself (do not entrust yourself with so many obligations and\nduties that you cannot honourably fulfil them or with such luxurious life as to be wicked and\nvicious).\nBecause if this load is more than what you can conveniently bear then your journey will be\nvery painful and tiresome to you. If you find around you such poor, needy and destitute\npeople who are willing to carry your load for you as far as the Day of Judgement then\nconsider this to be a boon, engage them and pass your burden on to them.\n(Distribute your wealth amongst the poor, destitute and the needy, help others to the best of\nyour ability and be kind and sympathetic to human beings). Thus relieve yourself from the\nheavy responsibility and liability of submitting an account on the Day of Judgement of how\nyou have made use of His Bounties (of health, wealth, power and position) and thus you may\narrive at the end of the journey, light and fresh, have enough provision for you there (reward\nof having done your duty to man and Allah in this world).\nHave as many weight-carriers as you can (help as many as you can) so that you may not miss\nthem when you very badly need them (when your sins of commission and omission will be\nbalanced against your good deeds you must have enough good deeds to turn the scale in your\nfavour). Remember that all you give out in charities and good deeds are like loans which will\nbe paid back to you.\nTherefore, when you are wealthy and powerful, make use of your wealth and power in such a\nway that you get all that back on the Day of Judgement, when you will be poor and helpless.\nBe it known to you, my son, that your passage lies through an appallingly dreadful valley\n(death or grave) and extremely trying and arduous journey.\nHere a man with light weight is far better than an over-burdened person and one who can\ntravel fast will pass through it quickly than the one whose encumbering forces go slowly. You\nshall have to pass through this valley.\nThe only way out of it is either in Paradise or in Hell. Therefore, it is wise to send your things\nthere beforehand so that they (good deeds) reach there before you, prearrange for the place of\nyour stay before you reach there because after death there is no repentance and no possibility\nof coming back to this world to undo the wrong done by you.\nRealize this truth, my son, that the Lord who owns and holds the treasures of Paradise and the\nearth has given you permission to ask and beg for them and He has promised to grant your\nprayers. He has told you to pray for His Favours that they may be granted to you and to ask\nfor His Blessings that they may be bestowed upon you. He has not appointed guards to\nprevent your prayers reaching Him. Nor is there any need for anybody to intercede before\nHim on your behalf.\nIf you go back upon your promises, if your break your vows, or start doing things that you\nhave repented of, He will not immediately punish you nor does He refuse His Blessings in\nhaste and if you repent once again He neither taunts you nor betrays you though you may\nfully deserve both, but He accepts your penitence and pardons you.\nHe never grudges His Forgiveness nor refuses His Mercy, on the contrary He has decreed\nrepentance as a virtue and pious deed. The Merciful Lord has ordered that every evil deed of\nyours will be counted as one and a good deed and pious action will be rewarded tenfold. He\nhas left the door of repentance open. He hears you whenever you call Him.\nHe accepts your prayer whenever you pray to Him. Invoke Him to grant you your heart's\ndesire, lay before Him the secrets of your heart, tell Him about all the calamities that have\nbefallen you and misfortunes which face you, and beseech His help to overcome them. You\nmay invoke His Help and Support in difficulties and distresses.\nYou may implore Him to grant you long life and sound health, you may pray to Him for\nprosperity and you may request Him for such favours and grants that none but He can bestow\nand award.\nThink over it that by simply granting you the privilege of praying for His Favours and\nMercies, He has handed over the keys of His treasures to you. Whenever you are in need you\nshould pray and He will confer His Bounties and Blessings. But sometimes you will find that\nyour requests are not immediately granted, then you need not be disappointed because the\ngrant of prayers often rests with the true purpose and intention of the implorer.\nSometimes the prayers are delayed because the Merciful Lord wants you to receive further\nrewards for patiently bearing calamities and sufferings and still believing sincerely in His\nHelp. Thus you may be awarded better favours than you requested for.\nSometimes your prayers are turned down, and this is also in your interest; because you often,\nunknowingly, ask for things that are really harmful to you. If your requests are granted they\nwill do you more harm than good and many of your requests may be such that if they are\ngranted they will result in your eternal damnation. Thus the refusal to accede to your\nsolicitations is a blessing in disguise to you. But very often your requests, if they are not\nreally harmful to you in this life or in the Hereafter, may be delayed but they are granted in\nquantities much more than you had asked for, bringing in more blessings in their wake than\nyou could ever imagine. So you should be very careful in asking Allah for His Favour.\nOnly pray for such things as are really beneficial to you, and are lasting and in the long run do\nnot end in harm. Remember, my dear son, that wealth and power (if you pray for them) are\nsuch things that they will not always be with you and may bring harm to you in the life in the\nHereafter.\nBe it known to you, my son, that you are created for the next world and not for this.\nYou are born to die and not to live forever. Your stay in this world is transient. You live in a\nplace which is subject to decay and destruction. It is a place where you will have to be busy\ngetting ready for the next world. It is a road (to the next world) on which you are standing.\nDeath is following you. You cannot run away from it. However hard you may try to avoid it,\nit is going to catch you sooner or later. Therefore take care that it may not catch you unawares\nor when you are not prepared for it, and no chance is left to you to repent the vices and sins\ncommitted and to undo the harm done by you.\nIf death catches you unawares, then you are eternally damned. Therefore, my dear son,\nalways keep three things in mind: death, your deeds and the life in the Hereafter. In this way\nyou will always be ready to face death and it will not catch you unawares.\nMy dear son, do not be carried away and be allured by the infatuations of the worldly people\nin the vicious life and its pleasures, and do not be impressed by the sight of their acute\nstruggle to possess and own this world. Allah has very mercifully explained to you everything\nabout this world. Not only the Merciful Lord but also the world has also told you everything;\nit has disclosed to you that it is mortal; it has openly declared its weakness, its shortcomings\nand its vices.\nRemember that these worldly-minded people are like barking dogs and hungry and ferocious\nbeasts. Some of them are constantly barking at others. The mighty lords kill and massacre the\npoor and the weak.\nTheir powerful persons exploit and tyrannize the powerless.\nTheir inordinate desires and their greed has such a complete hold over them that you will find\nsome of them like animals tamed and tied with a rope round their feet and necks. (They have\nlost the freedom of thought and cannot come out of the enslavement of their desires and\nhabits).\nWhile they are others whom wealth and power have turned mad. They behave like unruly\nbeasts, trampling, crushing and killing their fellow beings, and destroying things around them.\nThe history of this world is merely a reward of such incidents, some big and some small, the\ndifference is of might but the intensity is the same. These people have lost the balance of their\nminds.\nThey do not know what they are doing and where they are going, scan their activities and\nstudy their ways of thinking and you will find them confused and irrational, they appear like\ncattle wandering in a dreary desert where there is no water to drink and no fodder to eat, no\nshepherd to cater for them and no guardian to look after them. What has actually happened to\nthem is that the vicious world has taken possession of them, it is dragging them wherever it\nlikes, and is treating them as if they are blind because it has in reality blind-folded them\nagainst Divine light of true religion.\nThey are wandering without reasonable aims and sober purposes in the bewitching show that\nthe world has staged for them, they are fully intoxicated with the pleasures amassed around\nthem. They take this world to be their god and nourisher. The world is amusing them and they\nare amused with it and have forgotten and forsaken everything else.\nBut the nights of enjoyments and pleasures will not last long for anybody, the dawn of\nrealities will break sooner or later. The caravan of life will surely reach its destination one\nday. One who has nights and days acting as piebald horses for him, carrying him onward and\nonward towards his journey's end must remember that though he may feel as if he is stopping\nat one place yet actually he is moving on, he is proceeding to his destination. Everyday is\ncarrying him a step further in his journey towards death.\nBe it known to you, my son, that you cannot have every wish of yours granted, you cannot\nexpect to escape death, and you are passing through your days of life as others before you\nhave passed. Therefore, control your expectations, desires and cravings. Be moderate in your\ndemands. Earn your livelihood through scrupulously honest means.\nBe contented with what you get honestly and honourably. Have patience and do not let your\ndesires drive you madly because there are many desires which will lead you towards\ndisappointments and loss. Remember that every beggar or everyone who prays for a thing will\nnot always get what he begs or prays for and everyone who controls his desire, has selfrespect\nand does not beg or pray for things, will not always remain unlucky or disappointed.\nSo, do not bring down your self-respect, do not be mean and submissive and do not subjugate\nyourself through these vile and base traits though they may appear to make it possible for you\nto secure your hearts desires because nothing in this world can compensate for the loss of selfrespect,\nnobility and honour.\nTake care, my son! Be warned that you do not make yourself a slave of anybody. Allah has\ncreated you a freeman. Do not sell away your freedom in return of anything.\nThere is no actual gain and real value in benefits that you derive by selling your honour and\nself-respect or by subjugating yourself to disgrace and insults as there is no real good in\nwealth and power that you acquire by foul means.\nBeware, my son, that avarice and greed may not drive you towards destruction and\ndamnation. If you can succeed in having nobody as your benefactor but Allah, then try your\nbest to achieve this nobility because He will grant you your share whether you try to taunt\nyour donors, patrons and benefactors or not.\nRemember that the little which is given to you by Allah is going to be more useful and\nserviceable to you and is more honourable and respectable than what is granted by man in\nabundance. And what can a man give you but part of that which Allah has granted him?\nThe losses that you suffer on account of your silence can be easily compensated but the losses\nwhich arise out of excessive and loose talk are difficult to requite. Do you not see that the best\nway of guarding water in a water-bay is to close its mouth.\nTo guard what you already possess is better than to beg from others.\nThe bitterness of disappointment and poverty is in reality sweeter than the disgrace of\nbegging.\nReturns of hard but respectable labour of a craft or profession, though small in quantity, are\nbetter than the wealth which you amass through sin and wickedness.\nNobody can guard your secrets better than you.\nOften a man tries his best to acquire a thing which is most harmful to him.\nOne who talks too much makes most mistakes.\nOne who often reflects, develops his foresight.\nBy keeping company with good people, you will develop your character and by avoiding the\nsociety of wicked persons, you will abstain from wickedness.\nLivelihood acquired by foul means is the worst form of livelihood.\nTo oppress a weak and helpless person is the worst form of ferocity.\nIf your kindness or indulgence is going to bring forth cruel results, then severity of strictness\nis the real kindness.\nOften medicating results in disease; sometimes diseases prove to be health preservers.\nOften you obtain warnings and advice from people who are not fit to warn and advise you and\noften you come across advisers who are not sincere.\nDo not rely on vain hopes because vain hopes are assets of fools and idiots.\nWisdom is the name of the trait of remembering experiences and making use of them. The\nbest experience is the one which gives the best warning and advice.\nTake advantage of opportunities before they turn their backs on you.\nEveryone who tries cannot succeed.\nEveryone who departs this life will not return.\nThe worst form of follies is to waste opportunities of this life as well as to lose salvation.\nFor every action there is a reaction.\nShortly you will get what has been destined for you.\nThere is an element of risk and speculation in every trade as well as danger of loss.\nOften small returns prove as beneficial as big profits.\nAn accessory of an accomplice who insults you and a friend who has not formed a good\nopinion of you will not be of any help or use to you.\nTreat those with consideration and kindness over whom you have power and authority.\nDo not run the risk of endangering yourself through irrational, unreasonable and extravagant\nhopes.\nTake care so as not to be fooled by flattery.\nDo good to your brother when he is bent upon doing harm to you. When he ignores or\ndeclines to recognize the kinship, befriend him, go to his help and try to maintain relations. If\nhe is miserly with you and refuses to help you, be generous with him and support him\nfinancially. If he is cruel with you, be kind and considerate with him.\nIf he harms you accept his excuses. Behave with him as if he is a master and you are a slave,\nand he is a benefactor and you are a beneficiary. But be careful that you do not thus behave\nwith undeserving and mean persons.\nDo not develop friendship with the enemy of your friend otherwise your friend will turn into\nan enemy.\nAdvise your friend sincerely and to the best of your ability even though he may not like it.\nKeep a complete control over your temper and anger because I never found anything more\nbeneficial at the end and producing more good results than such a control.\nBe mild, pleasant and lenient with him who is harsh, gross, and strict with you; gradually he\nwill turn to your behaviour.\nGrant favour and be considerate to your enemy because you will thus gain either one of the\ntwo kinds of victories: (one rising above your enemy, the other of reducing the intensity of his\nhostility).\nIf you want to cease relations with your friend, then do not break off totally, let your heart\nretain some consideration for him so that you will still have some regard for him if he comes\nback to you.\nDo not disappoint a person who holds a good opinion of you and do not make him change his\nopinion.\nUnder the impression that you, as a friend, can behave as you like, do not violate the rights of\nyour friend because, when he is deprived of his rights and privileges, he will no more remain\nyour friend.\nDo not ill-treat members of your family and do not behave with them as if you are the most\ncruel man alive.\nDo not run after him who tries to avoid you.\nThe greatest achievement of your character is that the hostility of your brother against you\ndoes not overcome the consideration and friendship you feel towards him, and his illtreatment\nof you does not overbalance your kind treatment to him.\nDo not get worried and depressed over the oppressions because whoever oppresses you is in\nreality doing himself harm and is trying to find ways for your good.\nNever ill-treat a person who has done good to you.\nKnow it well, son, that there are two kinds of livelihood: one which you are searching for and\nthe other which follows you (which has been destined for you).\nIt will reach you even if you do not try to obtain it.\nTo be submissive, humble, crawling and begging when one is needy, powerless and poor and\nto be arrogant, oppressing and cruel when in power and opulence are two very ugly traits of\nthe human character.\nNothing in this world is really useful to you unless it has some utility and value for you for\nthe next world. If you at all want to lament over things which you have lost in this world then\nworry about the loss of things which had immortal values for you.\nThe past and almost all that was in your possession during the past is not with you know. You\nmay thus rationally come to the conclusion that the present and all that is in your possession\nnow will also leave you.\nDo not be like persons on whom advice has no effect; they require punishment to improve\nthem. A sensible man acquires education and culture through advice, while brutes and beasts\nalways improve through punishment.\nOvercome your sorrows, your worries and your misfortunes with patience and faith in the\nMerciful Lord and your hard work; one who gives up a straight path, honest and rational ways\nof thinking and working, will harm himself.\nA friend is like a relation and a true friend is one who speaks well of you even behind your\nback.\nInordinate desires are related with misfortunes.\nOften close relations behave more distantly than strangers and often strangers help you more\nthan your nearest relatives.\nPoor is he who has no friends.\nWhoever forsakes truth finds that his path of life has become narrow and troublesome.\nContentment and honesty are the lasting assets to retain ones prestige and position.\nThe strongest relation is the one which is between man and Allah.\nOne who does not care for you is your enemy.\nIf there is a danger of death or destruction in securing an object then safety lies in avoiding it.\nWeaknesses and shortcomings are not the things to talk about.\nOpportunities do not repeat themselves.\nSometimes very wise and learned persons fail to achieve the object they were aiming at and\nfoolish and uneducated people attain their purposes.\nPostpone evil deeds as long as possible because you can commit them whenever you so desire\n(then why hurry in committing them).\nTo cut connections with ignorant people is itself like forming connections with wise persons.\nWhoever trusts this world is betrayed by it and whoever gives it importance is disgraced by it.\nEvery arrow of yours will not hit the bull's eye.\nWhen status changes your conditions also change.\nBefore ascertaining the conditions of a route, find out what kinds of persons will accompany\nyou on the journey.\nInstead of enquiring about the condition of the home in which you are going to stay, first of\nall try to find out what kind of people your neighbours are.\nDo not introduce ridiculous topics in your talk even if you have to repeat sayings of others.\nDo not seek the advice of women, their verdicts are often immature and incorrect and their\ndeterminations are not firm. You must guard and defend them and act as a shelter to protect\nthem from impious and injurious surroundings and infamous sights, this kind of shelter will\nkeep them well-protected from every harm. Their contact with a vicious and sinful\natmosphere (even with all the shelter that you can provide) is going to prove more harmful\nthan being left with protection. Do not let them interfere with affairs where you cannot\npersonally guide or protect them. Do not let them aspire for things which are beyond their\ncapacities. They are more like decoration to humanity and are not made to rule and govern\nhumanity. Exhibit reasonable interest in things which they desire and give importance to\nthem, but do not let them influence your opinions and do not let them impel you to go against\nyour sane views.\nDo not force them into marriages which they abhor or which they consider below their dignity\nbecause there is danger of thus converting honourable and virtuous women into shameless\nand dishonourable beings.\nDivide and distribute work among your servants so that you can hold each one responsible for\nthe work entrusted to them. This is a better and smoother way of carrying on a work than each\none of them throwing the responsibility of every bit of work on somebody else.\nTreat the members of your family with love and respect because they act as wings with which\nyou fly and as hands which support you and fight for you. They are people towards whom\nyou turn when you are in trouble and in need.\nMy dear son! After having given these pieces of advice to you I entrust you to the Lord. He\nwill help, guide and protect you in this world and the Hereafter. I beseech Him to take you\nunder His protection in both the worlds.",{"title":1053,"searchDepth":1067,"depth":1067,"links":1068},2,[],"markdown","content:3.letters:letter_38.md","content","3.letters/letter_38.md","md",[1075,1075],null,1714025120944]
