Whoever persuades people to obey the orders of Allah\nprovides strength to the believers; whoever dissuades them from vices and sins humiliates the\nunbelievers; whoever struggles on all occasions discharges all his obligations and whoever\ndetests the vicious only for the sake of Allah, then Allah will take revenge on his enemies and\nwill be pleased with Him on the Day of Judgment.",{"type":1059,"tag":1064,"props":1216,"children":1217},{},[1218],{"type":1068,"value":1219},"There are four causes of infidelity and loss of belief in Allah: hankering after whims, a\npassion to dispute every argument, deviation from truth; and dissension, because whoever\nhankers after whims does not incline towards truth; whoever keeps on disputing every\nargument on account of his ignorance, will always remain blind to truth, whoever deviates\nfrom truth because of ignorance, will always take good for evil and evil for good and he will\nalways remain intoxicated with misguidance.

Therefore, remember carefully what I am telling you. Remember that\nthere are three kinds of people: one kind is of those learned people who are highly versed in\nthe ethics of truth and philosophy of religion, second is the kind of those who are acquiring\nthe above knowledge and the third is that class of people who are uneducated. They follow\nevery pretender and accept every slogan, they have neither acquired any knowledge nor have\nthey secured any support of firm and rational convictions. Remember, Kumayl, knowledge is\nbetter than wealth because it protects you while you have to guard wealth. It decreases if you\nkeep on spending it but the more you make use of knowledge the more it increases. What you\nget through wealth dis- appears as soon as wealth disappears but what you achieve through\nknowledge will remain even after you.\nO Kumayl ! Knowledge is power and it can command obedience. A man of knowledge during\nhis lifetime can make people obey and follow him and he is praised and venerated after his\ndeath. Remember that knowledge is a ruler and wealth is its subject.\nO Kumayl ! Those who amass wealth, though alive, are dead to realities of life, and those\nwho achieve know- ledge, will remain alive through their knowledge and wisdom even after\ntheir death, though their faces may disappear from the community of living beings, yet their\nideas, the knowledge which they had left behind and their memory, will remain in the minds\nof people\".\nKumayl says that after this brief dissertation, Imam Ali pointed towards his chest and said,\n\"Look Kumayl! Here I hold stores and treasures of knowledge. I wish I could find somebody\nto share it with me. Yes, I found a few, but one of them, though quite intelligent, was\nuntrustworthy, he would sell his salvation to get hold of the world and its pleasures, he would\nmake religion a pretence to grasp worldly power and wealth, he would make this Blessing of\nAllah (knowledge) serve him to get supremacy and control over friends of Allah and he\nwould through knowledge exploit and suppress other human beings. The other person was\nsuch that he apparently obeyed truth and knowledge, yet his mind had not achieved the true\nlight of religion, at the slightest ambiguity or doubt he would get suspicious of truth, mistrust\nreligion and would rush towards skepticism. So neither of them was capable of acquiring the\nsuperior knowledge that I can impart. Besides these two I find some other person One of them\nis a slave of self and greedy for inordinate desires, which can easily drag him away from the\npath of religion, the other is an avaricious, grasping and acquisitive miser who will risk his\nlife to grasp and hold wealth, none of these two will be of any use to religion or man, both of\nthem resemble beasts having appetite for food. If sensible trustees of knowledge and wisdom\ntotally disappear from human society then both knowledge and wisdom will suffer severely,\nmay bring harm to humanity and may even die out. But this earth will never be without those\npersons who will prove the universality of truth as disclosed by Allah, they may be wellknown\npersons, openly and fearlessly declaring the things revealed to them or they may,\nunder fear of harm, injury or deaths hide themselves from the public gaze and may carry on\ntheir mission privately so that the reasons proving the reality of truth as preached by religion\nand as demonstrated by His Prophet may not totally disappear. How many are they and where\ncould they be found? I swear by Allah that they are very few in number but their worth and\ntheir ranks before Allah are very high. Through them Allah preserves His Guidance so that\nthey, while departing, may hand over these truths to persons like themselves. The knowledge\nwhich they have acquired has made them see the realities and visualize the truth and has\ninstilled into them the spirit of faith and trust. The duties which were decreed as hard and\nunbearable by them. They feel happy in the company and association of things which frighten\nthe ignorant and uneducated. They live in this world like everybody else but their souls soar\nto the heights of Divine Eminence. They are media of Allah on this earth and they invite\npeople towards Him. How I love to meet them O Kumayl ! I have told you all that I have to\nsay, you can go back to your place whenever you like\".",{"type":1059,"tag":1064,"props":1781,"children":1782},{},[1783],{"type":1068,"value":1784},"A man can be valued through his sayings.",{"type":1059,"tag":1064,"props":1786,"children":1787},{},[1788],{"type":1068,"value":1789},"One who does not realize his own value is condemned to utter failure.

Imam\nAli thereupon advised him thus: \"Do not be among those people who want to gain good\nreturns without working hard for them, who have long hopes and keep on postponing\nrepentance and penance, who talk like pious persons but run after vicious pleasures. Do not be\namong those who are not satisfied if they get more in life and are not content if their lot in\nlife's pleasures is less (they are never satisfied), who never thank Allah for what they get and\nkeep on constantly demanding increase in what is left with them; who advise others to such\ngood deeds that they themselves refrain from; who appreciate good people but do not follow\ntheir ways of life; who hate bad and vicious people but follow their ways of life; who, on\naccount of their excessive sins hate death but do not give up the sinful ways of life; who, if\nfallen ill, repent their ways of life and on regaining their health fearlessly readopt the same\nfrivolous ways; who get despondent and lose all hopes, but on gaining health, become\narrogant and careless; who, if faced with misfor- tunes, dangers or afflictions, turn to Allah\nand keep on beseeching Him for relief and when relieved or favoured with comfort and ease\nthey are deceived by the comfortable conditions they found themselves in and forget Allah\nand forsake prayers; whose minds are allured by day dreams and forlorn hopes and who abhor\nto face realities of life; who fear for others the enormous repercussions of vices and sins but\nfor their own deeds expect very high rewards or very light disciplinary actions. Riches make\nsuch people arrogant, rebellious and wicked, and poverty makes them despondent and\nlethargic. If they have to work, they work lazily and if they put up a demand they do it\nstubbornly.\nUnder the influence of inordinate cravings, they commit sins in quick succession and keep on\npostponing repentance. Calamities and adversities make them give up the distinguished\ncharacteristics of Muslims (patience, hope in future and work for improvement of\ncircumstances). They advise people with narration's of events and facts but do not take any\nlesson from them. They are good at preachings but bad at practice, therefore they always talk\nof lofty deeds but their actions belie their words. They are keen to acquire temporal pleasures\nbut are careless and slow to achieve permanent (Divine) benefits. They think good for\nthemselves the things which are actually injurious to them and regard harmful the things\nwhich really benefit them. They are afraid of death but waste their time and do not resort to\ngood deeds before death overtakes them. The vices which they regard as enormous sins for\nothers, they consider as minor shortcomings for themselves. Similarly, they attach great\nimportance to their obedience to the orders of Allah and belittle similar actions in others.\nTherefore, they often criticize others and speak very highly of their own deeds. They are\nhappy to spend their time in society of rich persons, wasting it in luxuries and vices but are\naverse to employing for useful purposes in company of the poor and pious people: They are\nquick and free to pass verdicts against others but they never pass a verdict against their own\nvicious deeds. They force others to obey them but they never obey Allah. They collect their\ndues carefully but never pay the dues they owe. They are not afraid of Allah but fear powerful\nmen\".",{"type":1059,"tag":1064,"props":1796,"children":1797},{},[1798],{"type":1068,"value":1799},"Everyone has an end, it may be pleasant or sorrowful.",{"type":1059,"tag":1064,"props":1801,"children":1802},{},[1803],{"type":1068,"value":1804},"Everyone, who is born, has to die and once dead he is as good as having not come into\nexistence.",{"type":1059,"tag":1064,"props":1806,"children":1807},{},[1808],{"type":1068,"value":1809},"One, who adopts patience, will never be deprived of success though it may take a long\ntime to reach him.",{"type":1059,"tag":1064,"props":1811,"children":1812},{},[1813],{"type":1068,"value":1814},"One who assents or subsribes to the actions of a group or a party is as good as having\ncommitted the deed himself.
