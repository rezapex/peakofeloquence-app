He rose with his sword in hand, and the Tartar warriors leapt\ntowards Bukhara on their speedy stallions. `Alau'd-Din came out\nwith four hundred thousand combatants to face him but could not\nresist the incessant assaults of the Tartars, and having been\nvanquished only after a few attacks ran away to Nishabur across the\nriver Jaxartes (Sihun). The Tartars smashed Bukhara and razed it to\nthe ground. They pulled down schools and mosques, burning to ashes\nthe houses and killing men and women without distinction.

No city escaped their\nruining and no populace could avoid their trampling. Wherever they\nwent they upset the kingdom, overthrew governments, and in a short\ntime established their authority over the northern portion of Asia.\nWhen Chingiz Khan died in 622 A.H. his own son Ogedei Khan succeeded\nhim.

Rivers of blood flowed in\nthe streets and all the alleys were filled with dead bodies.
