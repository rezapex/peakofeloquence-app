Muslims would have certainly given\nconsideration to his age, seniority, prestige and distinction of\ncompanionship of the Prophet but his ways and deeds had so marred\nthe atmosphere that no one seemed prepared to sympathise and side\nwith him. The oppression and excesses perpetrated on high ranking\ncompanions of the Prophet had roused a wave of grief and anger among\nthe Arab tribes. Everyone was infuriated and looked at his\nhaughtiness and wrong doings with disdainful eyes. Thus, due to Abu\nDharr's disgrace, dishonour and exile Banu Ghifar and their\nassociate tribes, due to `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud's merciless beating\nBanu Hudhayl and their associates, due to breaking of the ribs of\n`Ammar ibn Yasir, Banu Makhzum and their associates Banu Zuhrah,\nand due to the plot for the killing of Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, Banu\nTaym all had a storm of rage in their hearts. The Muslims of other\ncities were also brimful of complaints at the hands of his officers\nwho under intoxication of wealth and the effects of luxury did\nwhatever they wished and crushed whomever they wanted. They had\nneither fear of punishment from the centre nor apprehension of any\nenquiry. People were fluttering to get out of their talons of\noppression but no one was ready to listen to their cries of pain and\nrestlessness; feelings of hatred were rising but no care was taken\nto put them down. The companions of the Prophet were also sick of\nhim as they saw that peace was destroyed, administration was\ntopsy-turvy and Islam's features were being metamorphosed. The poor\nand the starving were craving for dried crusts while Banu Umayyah\nwere rolling in wealth. The Caliphate had become a handle for\nbelly-filling and a means of amassing wealth. Consequently, they too\ndid not lag behind in preparing the ground for killing him. Rather,\nit was at their letters and messages that people from Kufah, Basrah\nand Egypt had collected in Medina. Observing this behaviour of the\npeople of Medina, `Uthman wrote to Mu`awiyah: 'So now, certainly\nthe people of Medina have turned heretics, have turned faith against\nobedience and broken the (oath of) allegiance.

But instead of\ngiving a reply `Uthman got this man turned out of the house and did\nnot regard their demands worth attention. On this these people\nentered the city to raise their voice against this pride and\nhaughtiness, and complained to the people of this behaviour besides\nother excesses. On the other side many people from Kufah and Basrah\nhad also arrived with their complaints and they, after joining these\nones, proceeded forward with the backing of the people of Medina and\nconfined `Uthman within his house, although there was no\nrestriction on his going and coming to the mosque. But in his sermon\non the very first Friday he severely rebuked these people and even\nheld them accursed, whereupon people got infuriated and threw\npebbles at him as a result of which he lost control and fell from\nthe pulpit.

Amir\nal-mu'minin said, \"On what terms can I ask them to leave when\ntheir demands are justified?\" `Uthman said, \"I authorise you in\nthis matter. Whatever terms you would settle with them I would be\nbound by them.\" So Amir al-mu'minin went and met the Egyptians and\ntalked to them. They consented to get back on the condition that all\nthe tyrannies should be wiped off and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr be made\ngovernor by removing Ibn Abi Sarh. Amir al-mu'minin came back and\nput their demand before `Uthman who accepted it without any\nhesitation and said that to get over these excesses time was\nrequired. Amir al-mu'minin pointed out that for matters concerning\nMedina delay had no sense. However, for other places so much time\ncould be allowed that the Caliph's message could reach them.\n`Uthman insisted that for Medina also three days were needed. After\ndiscussion with the Egyptians Amir al-mu'minin agreed to it also\nand took all the responsibility thereof upon himself. Then they\ndispersed at his suggestion. Some of them went to Egypt with\nMuhammad ibn Abi Bakr while some went to the valley of Dhakhushub\nand stayed there and this whole matter ended. On the second day of\nthis event Marwan ibn al-Hakam said to `Uthman, \"It is good, these\npeople have gone, but to stop people coming from other cities you\nshould issue a statement so that they should not come this way and\nsit quiet at their places and that statement should be that some\npeople collected in Medina on hearing some irresponsible talk but\nwhen they came to know that whatever they heard was wrong they were\nsatisfied and have gone back.\" `Uthman did not want to speak such\na clear lie but Marwan convinced him and he agreed, and speaking in\nthe Holy Prophet's mosque, he said:",{"type":1059,"tag":1143,"props":1169,"children":1170},{},[],{"type":1068,"value":1172},"\nThese Egyptians had received some news about their Caliph and when\nsatisfied that they were all baseless and wrong they went back to\ntheir cities.",{"type":1059,"tag":1143,"props":1174,"children":1175},{},[],{"type":1068,"value":1177},"\nNo sooner he said this than there was great hue and cry in the\nmosque, and people began to shout to `Uthman, \"Offer repentance,\nfear Allah; what is this lie you are uttering?\" `Uthman was\nconfused in this commotion and had to offer repentance.\nConsequently, he turned to the Ka`bah, moaned in the audience of\nAllah and returned to his house.",{"type":1059,"tag":1143,"props":1179,"children":1180},{},[],{"type":1068,"value":1182},"\nProbably after this very event Amir al-mu'minin advised `Uthman\nthat, \"You should openly offer repentance about your past misdeeds\nso that these uprisings should subside for good otherwise if\ntomorrow people of some other place come you will again cling to my\nneck to rid you of them.\" Consequently, he delivered a speech in\nthe Prophet's mosque wherein admitting his mistakes he offered\nrepentance and swore to remain careful in future.

You\nwould say only such a thing as would bring but death to him.\"\nMarwan took it ill and retorted, \"You have no right to interfere in\nthese matters. You are the daughter of that very person who did not\nknow till his death how to perform ablution.\" Na'ilah replied with\nfury, \"You are wrong, and are laying a false blame. Before uttering\nanything about my father you should have cast a glance on the\nfeatures of your father. But for the consideration of that old man I\nwould have spoken things at which people would have shuddered but\nwould have confirmed every such word.\" When `Uthman saw the\nconversation getting prolonged he stopped them and asked Marwan to\ntell him what he wished.",{"type":1059,"tag":1143,"props":1184,"children":1185},{},[],{"type":1068,"value":1187},"\nMarwan said, \"What is it you have said in the mosque, and what\nrepentance you have offered? In my view sticking to the sin was a\nthousand times better than this repentance because however much the\nsins may multiply there is always scope for repentance, but\nrepentance by force is no repentance. You have said what you have\nbut now see the consequences of this open announcement, that crowds\nof people are at your door. Now go forward and fulfil their\ndemands.\" `Uthman then said, \"Well, I have said what I have said,\nnow you deal with these people. It is not in my power to deal with\nthem.\" Consequently, finding out his implied consent Marwan came\nout and addressing the people spoke out, \"Why have you assembled\nhere? Do you intend to attack or to ransack? Remember, you cannot\neasily snatch away power from our hands, take out the idea from your\nhearts that you would subdue us.

You have forsaken faith for the sake of a faithless and\ncharacterless man and have lost all wit. At least you should have\nregard and consideration for your own promise. What is this that at\nMarwan's betokening you have set off with folded eyes. Remember he\nwill throw you in such a dark well that you will never be able to\ncome out of it. You have become the carrier animal of Marwan so that\nhe can ride on you howsoever he desires and put you on whatever\nwrong way he wishes.

Well, what is the good in following\nthe words of one who is without any respect among the people and low\nbefore their eyes. Make `Ali agree otherwise remember that\nrestoring the disturbed state of affairs is neither within your\npower nor in that of Marwan.\" `Uthman was impressed by this and\nsent a man after Amir al-mu'minin but he refused to meet him. There\nwas no siege around `Uthman but shame deterred him. With what face\ncould he come out of the house? But there was no way without coming\nout. Consequently, he came out quietly in the gloom of night and\nreaching Amir al-mu'minin's place, he moaned his helplessness and\nloneliness, offered excuses, and also assured him of keeping\npromises but Amir al-mu'minin said, \"You make a promise in the\nProphet's mosque standing before all the people but it is fulfilled\nin this way that when people go to you they are rebuked and even\nabuses are hurled at them.

I am not prepared to accept any responsibility on your\nbehalf. The tracks are open before you. Adopt whichever way you like\nand tread whatever track you choose.\" After this talk `Uthman came\nback and began blaming Amir al-mu'minin in retort to the effect\nthat all the disturbances were rising at his instance and that he\nwas not doing anything despite being able to do everything.",{"type":1059,"tag":1143,"props":1199,"children":1200},{},[],{"type":1068,"value":1202},"\nOn this side the result of repentance was as it was. Now let us see\nthe other side. When after crossing the border of Hijaz, Muhammad\nibn Abi Bakr reached the place Aylah on the coast of the Red Sea\npeople caught sight of a camel rider who was making his camel run so\nfast as though the enemy was chasing him. These people had some\nmisgivings about him and therefore called him and enquired who he\nwas. He said he was the slave of `Uthman. They enquired wherefore\nhe was bound. He said Egypt. They enquired to whom he was going. He\nreplied to the Governor of Egypt. People said that the Governor of\nEgypt was with them. To whom was he going then? He said he was to go\nto Ibn Abi Sarh. People asked him if any letter was with him. He\ndenied. They asked for what purpose he was going. He said he did not\nknow that. One of these people thought that his clothes should be\nsearched. So the search was made, but nothing was found on him.\nKinanah ibn Bishr at-Tujibi said, \"See his water-skin.\" People\nsaid, \"Leave him, how can there be a letter in water! Kinanah said,\n\"You do not know what cunning these people play. \" Consequently,\nthe water-skin was opened and seen. There was a lead pipe in it\nwherein was a letter. When it was opened and read, the Caliph's\norder in it was that \"When Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr and his party\nreaches you then from among them kill so and so, arrest so and so,\nand put so and so in jail, but you remain on your post.\" On reading\nthis all were stunned and thus began to look at one another in\nastonishment.",{"type":1059,"tag":1143,"props":1204,"children":1205},{},[],{"type":1068,"value":1207},"\nA Persian hemistich says: Mind was just burst in astonishment as to\nwhat wonder it was!",{"type":1059,"tag":1143,"props":1209,"children":1210},{},[],{"type":1068,"value":1212},"\nNow proceeding forward was riding into the mouth of death,\nconsequently they returned to Medina taking the slave with them.\nReaching there they placed that letter before all the companions of\nthe Prophet.

He replied\nthat it was his own. They enquired whose writing it was. He said it\nwas his secretary's. They enquired whose slave was that man. He\nreplied that it was his. They enquired whose riding beast it was. He\nreplied that it was that of the Government. They enquired who had\nsent it. He said he had no knowledge of it. People then said, \"Good\nHeavens.
