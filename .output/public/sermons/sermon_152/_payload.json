When we cast a glance at creation, we see that for\nevery movement there is a mover, from which every man of ordinary\nwisdom is compelled to conclude that no effect can appear without a\ncause, so much so, that even an infant a few days old, when his body\nis touched, feels in the depth of his consciousness that someone has\ntouched him. He indicates it by opening his eyes or turning and\nlooking. How then can the creation of the world and the system of\nall creation be arranged without a Creator or Organiser?",{"type":1059,"tag":1216,"props":1217,"children":1218},"br",{},[],{"type":1068,"value":1220},"\nOnce it is necessary to believe in a Creator, then He should exist\nby Himself, because everything which has a beginning must have a\ncentre of existence from which it should terminate. If that too\nneeded a creator, there would be the question of whether this\ncreator is also the creation of some other creator or exists by\nitself. Thus unless a Self-created Creator is believed in, who\nshould be the cause of all causes, the mind will remain groping in\nthe unending labyrinth of cause and effect, and never attain the\nidea of the last extremity of the series of creation. It would fall\ninto the fallacy of circular arguing and would not reach any end.",{"type":1059,"tag":1216,"props":1222,"children":1223},{},[],{"type":1068,"value":1225},"\nIf the creator were taken to have created himself, then there would\nbe (one of the two positions, namely) either he should be\nnon-existent or existent. If he were not existent, then it would not\nbe possible for something non-existent to create any existent being.\nIf he were existent before creating himself, there would be no sense\nin coming into being again. Therefore it is necessary to believe\nthat the Creator should be a Being not dependent on any other\ncreator for His own existence, and everything else should be\ndependent on Him. This dependence of the entire creation is a proof\nthat the existence of the Source of all creation is from ever and\neternal. And since all beings other than He are subject to change,\nare dependent on position and place and are similar to one another\nin qualities and properties, and since similarity leads to plurality\nwhereas unity has no like save itself, therefore nothing can be like\nHim.",{"type":1059,"tag":1216,"props":1227,"children":1228},{},[],{"type":1068,"value":1230},"\nEven things called one cannot be reckoned after His Unity because He\nis One and Singular in every respect. He is free and pure from all\nthose attributes which are found in body or matter because He is\nneither body, nor colour, nor shape, nor does He lie in any\ndirection, nor is He bounded within some place or locality.\nTherefore, man cannot see or understand Him through his senses or\nfeelings, because senses can know only those things which accord\nwith the limitations of time, place and matter. To believe that He\ncan be seen is to believe that He has body, but since He is not a\nbody, and He does not exist through a body, and He does not lie in\nany direction or place, there is no question of His being seen. But\nHis being unseen is not like that of subtle material bodies, due to\nwhose delicacy the eye pierces through them and eyes remain unable\nto see them; as for example the wind in the vast firmament. But He\nis unseen by His very existence. Nevertheless, nothing is unseen for\nHim. He sees as well as hears, but is not dependent on instruments\nof seeing or hearing, because if He were in need of organs of the\nbody for hearing and seeing He would be in need of external things\nfor His perfection and would not be a perfect Being, whereas He\nshould be perfect in all respects and no attribute of perfection\nshould be apart from His Self.",{"type":1059,"tag":1216,"props":1232,"children":1233},{},[],{"type":1068,"value":1235},"\nTo believe in attributes separately from His Self would mean that\nthere would be a self and a few attributes and the compound of the\nself and the attributes would be Allah. But a thing which is\ncompounded is dependent on its parts and these parts must exist\nbefore their composition into the whole. When the parts exist from\nbefore, how can the whole be from ever and eternal because its\nexistence is later than that of its parts. But Allah had the\nattributes of knowledge, power and sustaining even when nothing was\nexistent, because none of His attributes were created in Him from\noutside, but His attributes are His Self and His Self is His\nattributes. Consequently, His knowledge does not depend on the\nobject of knowledge existing first and then His knowledge, because\nHis Self is prior to things coming into existence. Nor is it\nnecessary for His power that there should first exist the object to\nbe over-powered and then alone He would be called Powerful, because\nPowerful is that who has power equally for doing or abandoning and\nas such the existence of the object to be over-powered is not\nnecessary.",{"type":1059,"tag":1216,"props":1237,"children":1238},{},[],{"type":1068,"value":1240},"\nSimilarly Sustainer means master.
