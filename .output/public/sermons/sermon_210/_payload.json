But when this selection is\nstudied some traditions which come across can, in no circumstances,\nbe attributed to the Prophet. The result is that a group of\nconsiderable number has cropped up among Muslims who, in view of\nthese (so-called) authoritative collections and true traditions,\ncompletely reject the evidentiary value of the traditions, (For\nfurther reference see al-Ghadir, vol.5, pp.\n208-378).]",{"type":1059,"tag":1400,"props":1471,"children":1472},{},[],{"type":1064,"value":1474},"The second category of relaters of traditions are those who, without\nappreciating the occasion or context, related whatever they could\nrecollect, right or wrong.
