2. Enhance Language Clarity:
    - Use simple language where possible.
    - Keep sentences concise and to the point.
    - Clearly mark transitions between topics or sections.

3. Add Semantic and Visual Enhancements:
    - Use italics or bold for emphasis, but sparingly.
    - Include links to references or further readings where applicable.
    - Add visual elements like icons or small graphics related to the key themes (e.g., a small icon of a book or a mosque next to headings about Islamic teachings).

4. Improve Accessibility:
    - Include summaries or abstracts at the beginning of each section.
    - Make sure the color contrast is high for better readability.
