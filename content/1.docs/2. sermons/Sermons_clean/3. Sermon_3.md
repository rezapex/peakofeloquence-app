*Known as the Sermon of ash-Shiqshiqiyah*

> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام) المعروفة بالشِّقْشِقِيَّة

> وتشتمل على الشكوى من أمر الخلافة ثم ترجيح صبره عنها ثم مبايعة الناس له

Beware! By Allah, the son of Abu Quhafah (Abu
Bakr){#epub.html_fref_039a2925_2
.see-footnote} dressed himself with it (the caliphate) and he certainly
knew that my position in relation to it was the same as the position of
the axis in relation to the hand-mill. The flood water flows down from
me and the bird cannot fly upto me. I put a curtain against the
caliphate and kept myself detached from it.

Then I began to think whether I should assault or endure calmly the
blinding darkness of tribulations wherein the grown up are made feeble
and the young grow old and the true believer acts under strain till he
meets Allah (on his death).

> أَمَا وَالله لَقَدْ تَقَمَّصَها ابْنُ اَبى قُحافَةَ ، وَإِنَّهُ لَيَعْلَمُ أَنَّ مَحَلِّيَ مِنهَا مَحَلُّ القُطْبِ
> مِنَ الرَّحَا، يَنْحَدِرُ عَنِّي السَّيْلُ، وَلا يَرْقَى إِلَيَّ الطَّيْرُ، فَسَدَلْتُ دُونَهَا ثَوْباً، وَطَوَيْتُ
> عَنْهَا كَشْحاً، وَطَفِقْتُ أَرْتَئِي بَيْنَ أَنْ أَصُولَ بِيَد جَذَّاءَ، أَوْ أَصْبِرَ عَلَى طَخْيَة عَمْيَاءَ،
> يَهْرَمُ فيهَا الكَبيرُ، وَيَشِيبُ فِيهَا الصَّغِيرُ، وَيَكْدَحُ فِيهَا مُؤْمِنٌ حَتَّى يَلْقَى رَبَّهُ.

## Proposes Patience in Absence of Supporters

> ترجيح الصبرعلى فقد الاعوان

I found that endurance thereon was wiser. So I adopted patience although
there was pricking in the eye and suffocation (of mortification) in the
throat. I watched the plundering of my inheritance till the first one
went his way but handed over the Caliphate to Ibn al-Khattab after
himself.

(Then he quoted al-A'sha's verse):

*My days are now passed on the camel's back (in difficulty) while there
were days (of ease) when I enjoyed the company of Jabir's brother
Hayyan.* {#epub.html_fref_6d03b44c_3
.see-footnote}

> فَرَأَيْتُ أَنَّ الصَّبْرَ عَلَى هَاتَا أَحْجَى، فَصَبَرتُ وَفي الْعَيْنِ قَذىً، وَفي الحَلْقِ شَجاً، أرى
> تُرَاثي نَهْباً، حَتَّى مَضَى الاْوَّلُ لِسَبِيلِهِ، فَأَدْلَى بِهَا إِلَى ابْنِ الْخَطّابِ بَعْدَهُ. ( ثم
> تمثل بقول الاعشى):

> شَتّانَ ما يَومي عَاى كُوْرِها \* و يَوْمُ حَيَّانَ أخي جابِرِ

It is strange that during his lifetime he wished to be released from the
caliphate but he confirmed it for the other one after his death. No
doubt these two shared its udders strictly among themselves. This one
put the Caliphate in a tough enclosure where the utterance was haughty
and the touch was rough. Mistakes were in plenty and so also the excuses
therefore. One in contact with it was like the rider of an unruly camel.
If he pulled up its rein the very nostril would be slit, but if he let
it loose he would be thrown. Consequently, by Allah people got involved
in recklessness, wickedness, unsteadiness and deviation.

> فَيَا عَجَباً!! بَيْنَا هُوَ يَسْتَقِيلُها في حَيَاتِهِ إِذْ عَقَدَهَا لاخَرَ بَعْدَ وَفَاتِهِ ـ لَشَدَّ مَا
> تَشَطَّرَا ضَرْعَيْهَا ! ـ فَصَيَّرَهَا في حَوْزَة خَشْنَاءَ، يَغْلُظُ كَلْمُهَا، وَيَخْشُنُ مَسُّهَا، وَيَكْثُرُ
> العِثَارُ فِيهَا وَالاْعْتَذَارُ مِنْهَا، فَصَاحِبُهَا كَرَاكِبِ الصَّعْبَةِ، إِنْ أَشْنَقَ لَهَا خَرَمَ، وَإِنْ
> أَسْلَسَ لَهَا تَقَحَّمَ، فَمُنِيَ النَّاسُ ـ لَعَمْرُ اللهِ ـ بِخَبْط وَشِمَاس، وَتَلَوُّن وَاعْتِرَاض.

Nevertheless, I remained patient despite length of period and stiffness
of trial, till when he went his way (of death) he put the matter (of
Caliphate) in a
group{#epub.html_fref_c1390a08_4
.see-footnote} and regarded me to be one of them. But good Heavens! What
had I to do with this "consultation"? Where was any doubt about me with
regard to the first of them that I was now considered akin to these
ones? But I remained low when they were low and flew high when they flew
high.

One of them turned against me because of his hatred and the other got
inclined the other way due to his in-law relationship and this thing and
that thing, till the third man of these people stood up with heaving
breasts between his dung and fodder. With him his children of his
grand-father, (Umayyah) also stood up swallowing up Allah's
wealth{#epub.html_fref_6cc56c09_5
.see-footnote} like a camel devouring the foliage of spring, till his
rope broke down, his actions finished him and his gluttony brought him
down prostrate.

> فَصَبَرْتُ عَلَى طُولِ الْمُدَّةِ، وَشِدَّةِ الْمحْنَةِ، حَتَّى إِذا مَضَى لِسَبِيلِهِ جَعَلَهَا في جَمَاعَة
> زَعَمَ أَنَّي أَحَدُهُمْ. فَيَاللهِ وَلِلشُّورَى! مَتَى اعْتَرَضَ الرَّيْبُ فِيَّ مَعَ الاْوَّلِ مِنْهُمْ، حَتَّى
> صِرْتُ أُقْرَنُ إِلَى هذِهِ النَّظَائِرِ! لكِنِّي أَسفَفْتُ إِذْ أَسَفُّوا، وَطِرْتُ إِذْ طَارُوا، فَصَغَا رَجُلُ
> مِنْهُمْ لِضِغْنِه، وَمَالَ الاْخَرُ لِصِهْرهِ، مَعَ هَن وَهَن. إِلَى أَنْ قَامَ ثَالِثُ القَوْمِ، نَافِجَاً
> حِضْنَيْهِ بَيْنَ نَثِيلهِ وَمُعْتَلَفِهِ، وَقَامَ مَعَهُ بَنُو أَبِيهِ يَخْضَمُونَ مَالَ اللهِ خَضْمَ الاْبِل
> نِبْتَةَ الرَّبِيعِ، إِلَى أَنِ انْتَكَثَ عَلَيْهِ فَتْلُهُ، وَأَجْهَزَ عَلَيْهِ عَمَلُهُ، وَكَبَتْ بِهِ بِطْنَتُهُ.

## Allegiance paid to 'Ali

> مبايعة علي (عليه السلام(

At that moment, nothing took me by surprise, but the crowd of people
rushing to me. It advanced towards me from every side like the mane of
the hyena so much so that Hasan and Husayn were getting crushed and both
the ends of my shoulder garment were torn. They collected around me like
a herd of sheep and goats. When I took up the reins of government one
party broke away and another turned disobedient while the rest began
acting wrongfully as if they had not heard the word of Allah saying:

***That abode in the hereafter, We assign it for those who intend not to
exult themselves in the earth, nor (to make) mischief (therein); and the
end is (best) for the pious ones. (Qur'an, 28:83)***

> فَمَا رَاعَنِي إلاَّ وَالنَّاسُ إليَّ كَعُرْفِ الضَّبُعِ، يَنْثَالُونَ عَلَيَّ مِنْ كُلِّ جَانِب، حَتَّى لَقَدْ
> وُطِىءَ الحَسَنَانِ، وَشُقَّ عِطْفَايَ، مُجْتَمِعِينَ حَوْلي كَرَبِيضَةِ الغَنَمِ. فَلَمَّا نَهَضْتُ بِالاْمرِ
> نَكَثَتْ طَائِفَةٌ، وَمَرَقَتْ أُخْرَى، وَفَسَقَ \[وقسط\] آخَرُونَ كَأَنَّهُمْ لَمْ يَسْمَعُوا اللهَ
> سُبْحَانَهُ يَقُولُ: (تِلْكَ الدَّارُ الاخِرَةُ نَجْعَلُهَا للَّذِينَ لاَ يُريدُونَ عُلُوّاً في الاَرْضِ
> وَلاَ فَسَاداً وَالعَاقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ(،

Yes, by Allah, they had heard it and understood it but the world
appeared glittering in their eyes and its embellishments seduced them.
Behold, by Him who split the grain (to grow) and created living beings,
if people had not come to me and supporters had not exhausted the
argument and if there had been no pledge of Allah with the learned to
the effect that they should not acquiesce in the gluttony of the
oppressor and the hunger of the oppressed I would have cast the rope of
Caliphate on its own shoulders, and would have given the last one the
same treatment as to the first one. Then you would have seen that in my
view this world of yours is no better than the sneezing of a goat.

> بَلَى! وَاللهِ لَقَدْ سَمِعُوهَا وَوَعَوْهَا، وَلكِنَّهُمْ حَلِيَتَ الدُّنْيَا في أَعْيُنِهمْ، وَرَاقَهُمْ
> زِبْرِجُهَا! أَمَا وَالَّذِي فَلَقَ الْحَبَّةَ، وَبَرَأَ النَّسَمَةَ، لَوْلاَ حُضُورُ الْحَاضِرِ، وَقِيَامُ
> الْحُجَّةِ بِوُجُودِ النَّاصِرِ، وَمَا أَخَذَ اللهُ عَلَى العُلَمَاءِ أَلاَّ يُقَارُّوا عَلَى كِظَّةِ ظَالِم،
> وَلا سَغَبِ مَظْلُوم، لاَلقَيْتُ حَبْلَهَا عَلَى غَارِبِهَا، وَلَسَقَيْتُ آخِرَهَا بِكَأْسِ أَوَّلِها،
> وَلاَلفَيْتُمْ دُنْيَاكُمْ هذِهِ أَزْهَدَ عِنْدِي مِنْ عَفْطَةِ عَنْز!

(It is said that when Amir al-mu'minin reached here in his sermon a man
of Iraq stood up and handed him over a writing. Amir al-mu'minin began
looking at it, when Ibn 'Abbas said, "O' Amir al-mu'minin, I wish you
resumed your Sermon from where you broke it." Thereupon he replied, "O'
Ibn 'Abbas it was like the foam of a Camel which gushed out but
subsided." Ibn 'Abbas says that he never grieved over any utterance as
he did over this one because Amir al-mu'minin could not finish it as he
wished to.)

> قالوا: وقام إِليه رجل من أهل السوادعند بلوغه إلى هذا الموضع من خطبته،
> فناوله كتاباً، فأقبل ينظر فيه، فلمّا فرغ من قراءته قال له ابن عباس: يا
> أميرالمؤمنين، لو اطَّرَدت مَقالتكَ من حيث أَفضيتَ! فَقَالَ(عليه السلام): هَيْهَاتَ
> يَابْنَ عَبَّاس! تِلْكَ شِقْشِقَةٌ هَدَرَتْ ثُمَّ قَرَّتْ! قال ابن عباس: فوالله ما أَسفت على
> كلام قطّ كأَسفي على ذلك الكلام أَلاَّ يكون أميرالمؤمنين (عليه السلام) بلغ
> منه حيث أراد.

**Al-Sharif al-Radi says:** The words in this sermon "like the rider of
a camel" mean to convey that when a camel rider is stiff in drawing up
the rein then in this scuffle the nostril gets bruised, but if he lets
it loose in spite of the camel's unruliness, it would throw him
somewhere and would get out of control. *"ashnaq an-naqah"* is used when
the rider holds up the rein and raises the camel's head upwards. In the
same sense the word *"shanaqa an-naqah"* is used. Ibn as-Sikkit has
mentioned this in *Islah al-Mantiq*.

Amir al-mu'minin has said *"ashnaqa laha"* instead of *"ashnaqaha"*,
this is because he has used this word in harmony with *"aslasa laha"*
and harmony could be retained only by using both in the same form. Thus,
Amir al-mu'minin has used *"ashnaqa laha"* as though in place of *"in
rafa'a laha ra'saha"*, that is, "if he stops it by holding up the
reins."

> قال الشريف الرضي: قوله (عليه السلام) في هذه الخطبة: «كراكب الصعبة إن
> أشنق لها خرم، وإن أسلس لها تقحم» يريد: أنه إذا شدد عليها في جذب الزمام
> وهي تنازعه رأسها خرم أنفها، وإن أرخى لها شيئاً مع صعوبتها تقحمت به فلم
> يملكها، يقال: أشنق الناقة، إذا جذب رأسها بالزمام فرفعه، وشنقها أيضاً:
> ذكر ذلك ابن السكيت في «إصلاح المنطق». وإنما قال (عليه السلام): «أشنق
> لها» ولم يقل: «أشنقها»، لانه جعله في مقابلة قوله: «أسلس لها»، فكأنه
> (عليه السلام) قال: إن رفع لها رأسها يعني أمسكه عليها بالزمام .

-  This sermon is
    known as the sermon of ash-Shiqshiqiyyah, and is counted among the
    most famous sermons of Amir al-mu\'minin. It was delivered at
    ar-Rahbah. Although some people have denied it to be Amir
    al-mu\'minin\'s utterance and by attributing it to as-Sayyid ar-Radi
    (or ash-Sharif ar-Radi) have laid blame on his acknowledged
    integrity, yet truth-loving scholars have denied its veracity. Nor
    can there be any ground for this denial because \`Ali\'s (p.b.u.h.)
    difference of view in the matter of Caliphate is not a secret
    matter, so that such hints should be regarded as something alien.
    And the events which have been alluded to in this sermon are
    preserved in the annals of history which testifies them word by word
    and sentence by sentence.]

    If the same events which are related by history are recounted by
    Amir al-mu\'minin then what is the ground for denying them? If the
    memory of discouraging circumstances faced by him soon after the
    death of the Prophet appeared unpalatable to him it should not be
    surprising. No doubt this sermon hits at the prestige of certain
    personalities and gives a set back to the faith and belief in them
    but this cannot be sustained by denying the sermon to be Amir
    al-mu\'minin\'s utterance, unless the true events are analysed and
    truth unveiled; otherwise just denying it to be Amir al-mu\'minin\'s
    utterance because it contains disparagement of certain individuals
    carries no weight, when similar criticism has been related by other
    historians as well. Thus (Abu \`Uthman) \`Amr ibn Bahr al-Jahiz has
    recorded the following words of a sermon of Amir al-mu\'minin and
    they are not less weighty than the criticism in the \"Sermon of
    ash-Shiqshiqiyyah.\"

    Those two passed away and the third one rose like the crow whose
    courage is confined to the belly. It would have been better if both
    his wings had been cut and his head severed.

    Consequently, the idea that it is the production of as-Sayyid
    ar-Radi is far from truth and a result of partisanship and
    partiality. Or else if it is the result of some research it should
    be brought out. Otherwise, remaining in such wishful illusion does
    not alter the truth, nor can the force of decisive arguments be
    curbed down by mere disagreement and displeasure.

    Now we set forth the evidence of those scholars and traditionists
    who have clearly held it to be Amir al-mu\'minin\'s production, so
    that its historical importance should become known. Among these
    scholars some are those before as-Sayyid ar-Radi\'s period, some are
    his contemporaries and some are those who came after him but they
    all related it through their own chain of authority.

    1\) Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid al-Mu\`tazili writes that his master
    Abu\'l-Khayr Musaddiq ibn Shabib al-Wasiti (d. 605 A.H.) stated that
    he heard this sermon from ash-Shaykh Abu Muhammad \`Abdullah ibn
    Ahmad al-Baghdadi (d. 567 A.H.) known as Ibn al-Khashshab and when
    he reached where Ibn \`Abbas expressed sorrow for this sermon having
    remained incomplete Ibn al-Khashshab said to him that if he had
    heard the expression of sorrow from Ibn \`Abbas he would have
    certainly asked him if there had remained with his cousin any
    further unsatisfied desire because excepting the Prophet he had
    already spared neither the predecessors nor followers and had
    uttered all that he wished to utter. Why should therefore be any
    sorrow that he could not say what he wished?

    Musaddiq says that Ibn al-Khashshab was a man of jolly heart and
    decent taste. I inquired from him whether he also regarded the
    sermon to be a fabrication when he replied \"By Allah, I believe it
    to be Amir al-mu\'minin\'s word as I believe you to be Musaddiq ibn
    Shabib.\" I said that some people regard it to be as-Sayyid
    ar-Radi\'s production when he replied: \"How can ar-Radi have such
    guts or such style of writing. I have seen as-Sayyid ar-Radi\'s
    writings and know his style of composition. Nowhere does his writing
    match with this one and I have already seen it in books written two
    hundred years before the birth of as-Sayyid ar-Radi, and I have seen
    it in familiar writings about which I know by which scholars or men
    of letters they were compiled. At that time not only ar-Radi but
    even his father Abu Ahmad an-Naqib has not been born.\"

    2\) Thereafter Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid writes that he saw this sermon in
    the compilations of his master Abu\'l-Qasim (\`Abdullah ibn Ahmad)
    al-Balkhi (d. 317 A.H.). He was the Imam of the Mu\'tazilites in the
    reign of al-Muqtadir Billah while al-Muqtadir\'s period was far
    earlier than the birth of as-Sayyid ar-Radi.

    3\) He further writes that he saw this sermon in Abu Ja\`far
    (Muhammad ibn \`Abd ar-Rahman), Ibn Qibah\'s book al-Insaf. He was
    the pupil of Abu\'l-Qasim al-Balkhi and a theologian of Imamiyyah
    (Shi\`ite) sect. (Sharh of Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid, vol.1, pp.205-206)

    4\) Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani (d. 679 A.H.) writes in his commentary
    that he had seen one such copy of this sermon which bore writing of
    al-Muqtadir Billah\'s minister Abu\'l-Hasan \`Ali ibn Muhammad ibn
    al-Furat (d. 312 A.H.). (Sharh al-balaghah, vol.1., pp.252-253)

    5\) al-\`Allamah Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi has related the following
    chain of authority about this Sermon from ash-Shaykh Qutbu\'d-Din
    ar-Rawandi\'s compilation Minhaj al-bara\`ah fi Sharh Nahjul
    Balaghah: Ash-Shaykh Abu Nasr al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim
    informed me from al-Hajib Abu\'l-Wafa\' Muhammad ibn Badi\`,
    al-Husayn ibn Ahmad ibn Badi\` and al-Husayn ibn Ahmad ibn \`Abd
    ar-Rahman and they from al-Hafiz Abu Bakr (Ahmad ibn Musa) ibn
    Marduwayh al-Isbahani (d. 416 A.H.) and he from al-Hafiz
    Abu\'l-Qasim Sulayman ibn Ahmad at-Tabarani (d. 360 A.H.) and he
    from Ahmad ibn \`Ali al-Abbar and he from Is\'haq ibn Sa\`id Abu
    Salamah ad-Dimashqi and he from Khulayd ibn Da\`laj and he from
    \`Ata\' ibn Abi Rabah and he from Ibn \`Abbas. (Bihar al-anwar, 1st
    ed. vol.8, pp.160-161)

    6\) In the context al-\`Allamah al-Majlisi has written that this
    sermon is also contained in the compilations of Abu \`Ali (Muhammad
    ibn \`Abd al-Wahhab) al-Jubba \'i (d. 303 A.H.) .

    7\) In connection with this very authenticity al-\`Allamah
    al-Majlisi writes: Al-Qadi \`Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad al-Asad\'abadi
    (d. 415A.H.) who was a strict Mu\`tazilite explains some expressions
    of this sermon in his book al-Mughni and tries to prove that it does
    not strike against any preceding caliph but does not deny it to be
    Amir al-mu\'minin\'s composition. (ibid., p.161)

    8\) Abu Ja\`far Muhammad ibn \`Ali, Ibn Babawayh (d. 381 A.H.)
    writes: Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Is\'haq at-Talaqani told us that
    \`Abd al-\`Aziz ibn Yahya al-Jaludi (d. 332 A.H.) told him that Abu
    \`Abdillah Ahmad ibn \`Ammar ibn Khalid told him that Yahya ibn
    \`Abd al-Hamid al- Himmani (d. 228 A.H.) told him that \`Isa ibn
    Rashid related this sermon from \`Ali ibn Hudhayfah and he from
    \`Ikrimah and he from Ibn \`Abbas. (\`Ilal ash-shara\'i\`,vol.1,
    chap. 122, p.144; Ma\`ani al-akhbar, chap.22, pp.360-361)\
    9) Then Ibn Babawayh records the following chain of authorities :-
    Muhammad ibn \`Ali Majilawayh related this sermon to us and he took
    it from his uncle Muhammad ibn Abi\'l-Qasim and he from Ahmad ibn
    Abi \`Abdillah (Muhammad ibn Khalid) al-Barqi and he from his father
    and he from (Muhammad) Ibn Abi \`Umayr and he from Aban ibn \`Uthman
    and he from Aban ibn Taghlib and he from \`Ikrimah and he from Ibn
    \`Abbas. (\`Ilal ash-shara\'i\`, vol.1, chap.122, p.l46; Ma\`ani
    al-akhbar, chap.22, p.361)\
    10) Abu Ahmad al-Hasan ibn \`Abdillah ibn Sa\`id al-\`Askari (d.382
    A.H.) who counts among great scholars of the Sunnis has written
    commentary and explanation of this sermon that has been recorded by
    Ibn Babawayh in \`Ilal ash-shara\'i\` and Ma\`ani al-akhbar.\
    11) as-Sayyid Ni\`matullah al-Jaza\'iri writes: The author of Kitab
    al-gharat Abu Is\'haq, Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ath-Thaqafi al-Kufi (d.
    283 A.H.) has related this sermon through his own chain of
    authorities. The date of completion of writing this book is Tuesday
    the 13th Shawwal 255 A.H. and in the same year, Murtada al-Musawi
    was born. He was older in age than his brother as-Sayyid ar-Radi.
    (Anwar an-Nu\`maniyyah, p.37)\
    12) as-Sayyid Radi ad-Din Abu\'l-Qasim \`Ali ibn Musa, Ibn Tawus
    al-Husayni al-Hulli (d. 664 A.H.) has related this sermon from Kitab
    al-gharat with the following chain of authorities:- This sermon was
    related to us by Muhammad ibn Yusuf who related it from al-Hasan ibn
    \`Ali ibn \`Abd al-Karim az-Za\`farani and he from Muhammad ibn
    Zakariyyah al-Ghallabi and he from Ya\`qub ibn Ja\`far ibn Sulayman
    and he from his father and he from his grand-father and he from Ibn
    \`Abbas. (Translation of at-Tara\'if, p.202)\
    13) Shaykh at-Ta\'ifah, Muhammad ibn al- Hasan at-Tusi (d. 460 A.H.)
    writes: (Abu\'l-Fath Hilal ibn Muhammad ibn Ja\`far) al-Haffar
    related this sermon to us. He related it from Abu\'l-Qasim (Isma\`il
    ibn \`Ali ibn \`Ali) ad-Di\`bili and he from his father and he from
    his brother Di\`bil (ibn \`Ali al-Kuza\`i) and he from Muhammad ibn
    Salamah ash-Shami and he from Zurarah ibn A\`yan and he from Abu
    Ja\`far Muhammad ibn \`Ali and he from Ibn \`Abbas. (al-Amali,
    p.237)\
    14) ash-Shaykh al-Mufid (Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn an-Nu\`man, d.
    413 A.H.) who was the teacher of as-Sayyid ar-Radi writes about the

    account of this sermon from Ibn \`Abbas through various chains. Ibn
    \`Abbas said that he was in the audience of Amir al-mu\'minin at
    ar-Rahbah (a place in Kufah) when conversation turned to Caliphate
    and those who had preceded him as Caliphs, when Amir al-mu\'minin
    breathed a sigh and delivered this sermon. (al-Ihtijaj, p. 101)\

    al-Hanafi (d. 654 A.H.) writes: Our ash-Shaykh Abu\'l-Qasim an-Nafis
    al-Anbari related this sermon to us through his chain of authorities
    that ends with Ibn \`Abbas, who said that after allegiance had been
    paid to Amir al-mu\'minin as Caliph he was sitting on the pulpit
    when a man from the audience enquired why he had remained quiet till
    then whereupon Amir al-mu\'minin delivered this sermon extempore.

    18) al-Qadi Ahmad ibn Muhammad, ash-Shihab al-Khafaji (d. 1069 A.H.)
    writes with regard to its authenticity: It is stated in the
    utterances of Amir al-mu\'minin \`Ali (Allah may be pleased with
    him) that \"It is strange during life time he (Abu Bakr) wanted to
    give up the Caliphate but he strengthened its foundation for the
    other one after his death.\" (Sharh durrat al-ghawwas, p.17)\
    19) ash-Shaykh \`Ala ad-Dawlah as-Simnani writes: Amir al-mu\'minin
    Sayyid al-\`Arifin \`Ali (p.b.u.h.) has stated in one of his
    brilliant Sermons \"this is the Shiqshiqah that burst forth.\"
    (al-\`Urwah li ahl al-khalwah wa\'l-jalwah, p3, manuscript in
    Nasiriah Library, Lucknow, India)\
    20) Abu\'l-Fadl Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Maydani (d. 518 A.H.) has
    written in connection with the word Shiqshiqah: One sermon of Amir
    al-mu\'minin \`Ali is known as Khutbah ash-Shiqshiqiyyah (the sermon
    of the Camel\'s Foam). (Majma\` al-amthal, vol.1, p.369)\
    21) In fifteen places in an-Nihayah while explaining the words of
    this sermon Abu\'s-Sa\`adat Mubarak ibn Muhammad, Ibn al-Athir
    al-Jazari (d. 606 A.H.) has acknowledged it to be Amir
    al-mu\'minin\'s utterance.\
    22) Shaykh Muhammad Tahir Patni while explaining the same words in
    Majma\` bihar al-anwar testifies this sermon to be Amir
    al-mu\'minin\'s by saying, \"\`Ali says so.\"\
    23) Abu\'l-Fadl ibn Manzur (d. 711 A.H.) has acknowledged it as Amir
    al-mu\'minin\'s utterance in Lisan al-\`Arab, vol.12, p.54 by
    saying, \"In the sayings of \`Ali in his sermon \'It is the camel\'s
    foam that burst forth then subsided.\'\"\
    24) Majdu\'d-Din al-Firuz\'abadi (d. 816/817 A.H.) has recorded
    under the word \"Shiqshiqah\" in his lexicon (al-Qamus, vol.3,
    p.251): Khutbah ash-Shiqshiqiyyah is by \`Ali so named because when
    Ibn \`Abbas asked him to resume it where he had left it, he said
    \"O\' Ibn \`Abbas! it was the foam of a camel that burst forth then
    subsided.\"\
    25) The compiler of Muntaha al-adab writes: Khutbah
    ash-Shiqshiqiyyah of \`Ali is attributed to \`Ali (Allah may honour
    his face).\
    26) ash-Shaykh Muhammad \`Abduh, Mufti of Egypt, recognising it as
    Amir al-mu\'minin\'s utterance, has written its explanations.\
    27) Muhammad Muhyi\'d-Din \`Abd al-Hamid, Professor in the Faculty
    of Arabic Language, al-Azhar University has written annotations on
    Nahjul Balaghah adding a foreword in the beginning wherein he
    recognises all such sermons which contain disparaging remarks to be
    the utterances of Amir al-mu\'minin.\
    In the face of these evidences and undeniable proofs is there any
    scope to hold that it is not Amir al-mu\'minin\'s production and
    that as-Sayyid ar-Radi prepared it himself?

-  Amir al-mu\'minin
    has referred to Abu Bakr\'s accession to the Caliphate
    metaphorically as having dressed himself with it. This was a common
    metaphor. Thus, when \`Uthman was called to give up the Caliphate he
    replied, \"I shall not put off this shirt which Allah has put on
    me.\" No doubt Amir al-mu\'minin has not attributed this dressing of
    Caliphate to Allah but to Abu Bakr himself because according to
    unanimous opinion his Caliphate was not from Allah but his own
    affair. That is why Amir al-mu\'minin said that Abu Bakr dressed
    himself with the Caliphate.]

    He knew that this dress had been stitched for his own body and his
    position with relation to the Caliphate was that of the axis in the
    hand-mill which cannot retain its central position without it nor be
    of any use. Similarly, he held \"I was the central pivot of the
    Caliphate, were I not there, its entire system would have gone
    astray from the pivot. It was I who acted as a guard for its
    organisation and order and guided it through all difficulties.
    Currents of learning flowed from my bosom and watered it on all
    sides. My position was high beyond imagination but lust of world
    seekers for government became a tumbling stone for me and I had to
    confine myself to seclusion. Blinding darkness prevailed all round
    and there was intense gloom everywhere. The young grew old and the
    old departed for the graves but this patience-breaking period would
    not end. I kept watching with my eyes the plundering of my own
    inheritance and saw the passing of Caliphate from one hand to the
    other but remained patient as I could not stop their high-handedness
    for lack of means.\"

    Need For The Prophet\'s Caliph And The Mode Of His Appointment

    After the Prophet of Islam the presence of such a personality was
    inevitable who could stop the community from disintegration and
    guard the religious law against change, alteration and interference
    by those who wanted to twist it to suit their own desires. If this
    very need is denied then there is no sense in attaching so much
    importance to the succession of the Prophet that the assemblage in
    Saqifah of Banu Sa\`idah should have been considered more important
    than the burial of the Prophet.

    If the need is recognised, the question is whether or not the
    Prophet too realised it. If it is held he could not attend to it and
    appreciate its need or absence of need it would be the biggest proof
    for regarding the Prophet\'s mind to be blank for thinking of means
    to stop the evils of innovations and apostasy in spite of having
    given warnings about them. If it is said that he did realise it but
    had to live it unresolved on account of some advantage then instead
    of keeping it hidden the advantage should be clearly indicated
    otherwise silence without purpose would constitute delinquency in
    the discharge of the obligations of Prophethood. If there was some
    impediment, it should be disclosed otherwise we should agree that
    just as the Prophet did not leave any item of religion incomplete he
    did not leave this matter either and did propose such a course of
    action for it, that if it was acted upon religion would have
    remained safe against the interference of others.

    The question now is what was that course of action. If it is taken
    to be the consensus of opinion of the community then it cannot truly
    take place as in such consensus acquiescence of every individual is
    necessary; but taking into account the difference in human
    temperaments it seems impossible that they would agree on any single
    point. Nor is there any example where on such matters there has been
    no single voice of dissent. How then can such a fundamental need be
    made dependent on the occurrence of such an impossible event - need
    on which converges the future of Islam and the good of the Muslims.
    Therefore, the mind is not prepared to accept this criterion. Nor is
    tradition in harmony with it, as al-Qadi \`Adud ad-Din al-\'Iji has
    written in Sharh al-mawaqif: 'You should know that Caliphate cannot
    depend upon unanimity of election because no logical or traditional
    argument can be advanced for it'.

    In fact when the advocates of unanimous election found that
    unanimity of all votes is difficult they adopted the agreement of
    the majority as a substitute for unanimity, ignoring the difference
    of the minority. In such a case also it often happens that the force
    of fair and foul or correct and incorrect ways turns the flow of the
    majority opinion in the direction where there is neither individual
    distinction nor personal merit as a result of which competent
    persons remain hidden while incompetent individuals stand forward.

    When capabilities remain so curbed and personal ends stand in the
    way as hurdles, how can there be expectation for the election of
    correct person. Even if it is assumed that all voters have an
    independent unbiased view, that none of them has his own objective
    and that none has any other consideration, it is not necessary that
    every verdict of the majority should be correct, and that it cannot
    go astray. Experience shows that after experiment the majority has
    held its own verdict to be wrong.

    If every verdict of the majority is correct then its first verdict
    should be wrong because the verdict which holds it wrong is also
    that of the majority. In this circumstances if the election of the
    Caliph goes wrong who would be responsible for the mistake, and who
    should face the blame for the ruination of the Islamic polity.
    Similarly on whom would be the liability for the bloodshed and
    slaughter following the turmoil and activity of the elections. When
    it has been seen that even those who sat in the audience of the Holy
    Prophet could not be free of mutual quarrel and strife how can
    others avoid it.

    If with a view to avoid mischief it is left to the people of
    authority to choose anyone they like then here too the same friction
    and conflict would prevail because here again convergence of human
    temperaments on one point is not necessary nor can they be assumed
    to rise above personal ends. In fact here the chances of conflict
    and collision would be stronger because if not all at least most of
    them would themselves be candidates for that position and would not
    spare any effort to defeat their opponent, creating impediments in
    his way as best as possible. Its inevitable consequence would be
    mutual struggle and mischief-mongering.

    Thus, it would not be possible to ward off the mischief for which
    this device was adopted, and instead of finding a proper individual
    the community would just become an instrument for the achievement of
    personal benefits of the others. Again, what would be the criterion
    for these people in authority? The same as has usually been, namely
    whoever collects a few supporters and is able to create commotion in
    any meeting by use of forceful words would count among the people of
    authority. Or would capabilities also be judged? If the mode of
    judging the capabilities is again this very common vote then the
    same complications and conflicts would arise here too, to avoid
    which this way was adopted.

    If there is some other standard, then instead of judging the
    capabilities of the voters by it why not judge the person who is
    considered suitable for the position in view. Further, how many
    persons in authority would be enough to give a verdict? Apparently a
    verdict once accepted would be precedent for good and the number
    that would give this verdict would become the criterion for future.
    al-Qadi \`Adud ad-Din al-\'Iji writes: 'Rather the nomination of one
    or two individuals by the people in authority is enough because we
    know that the companions who were strict in religion deemed it
    enough as the nomination of Abu Bakr by \`Umar and of \`Uthman by
    \`Abd ar-Rahman'. (Sharh al-mawaqif, p.351 )

    This is the account of the \"unanimous election\" in the Hall of
    Bani Sa\`idah and the activity of the consultative assembly: that
    is, one man\'s action has been given the name of unanimous election
    and one individual\'s deed given the name of consultative assembly.
    Abu Bakr had well understood this reality that election means the
    vote of a person or two only which is to be attributed to common
    simple people.

    That is why he ignored the requirements of unanimous election,
    majority vote or method of choosing through electoral assembly and
    appointed \`Umar by nomination. \`A\'ishah also considered that
    leaving the question of caliphate to the vote of a few particular
    individuals meant inviting mischief and trouble. She sent a word to
    \`Umar on his death saying: Do not leave the Islamic community
    without a chief. Nominate a Caliph for it and leave it not without
    an authority as otherwise I apprehend mischief and trouble.

    When the election by those in authority proved futile it was given
    up and only \"might is right\" became the criteria-namely whoever
    subdues others and binds them under his sway and control is accepted
    as the Caliph of the Prophet and his true successor. These are those
    self-adopted principles in the face of which all the Prophet\'s
    sayings uttered in the \"Feast of the Relatives,\" on the night of
    hijrah, at the battle of Tabuk, on the occasion of conveying the
    Qur\'anic chapter \"al-Bara\'ah\" (at-Tawbah, chap.9) and at Ghadir
    (the spring of) Khumm.

    The strange thing is that when each of the first three caliphates is
    based on one individual\'s choice how can this very right to choose
    be denied to the Prophet himself, particularly when this was the
    only way to end all the dissension, namely that the Prophet should
    have himself settled it and saved the community from future
    disturbances and spared it from leaving this decision in the hands
    of people who were themselves involved in personal aims and objects.
    This is the correct procedure which stands to reason and which has
    also the support of the Prophet\'s definite sayings.

-  Hayyan ibn
    as-Samin al-Hanafi of Yamamah was the chief of the tribe Banu
    Hanifah and the master of fort and army. Jabir is the name of his
    younger brother while al-A\`sha whose real name was Maymun ibn Qays
    ibn Jandal enjoyed the position of being his bosom friend and led a
    decent happy life through his bounty. In this verse he has compared
    his current life with the previous one that is the days when he
    roamed about in search of livelihood and those when he led a happy
    life in Hayyan\'s company.]

    Generally Amir al-mu\'minin\'s quoting of this verse has been taken
    to compare this troubled period with the peaceful days passed under
    the care and protection of the Prophet when he was free from all
    sorts of troubles and enjoyed mental peace. But taking into account
    the occasion for making this comparison and the subject matter of
    the verse it would not be far fetched if it is taken to indicate the
    difference between the unimportant position of those in power during
    the Prophet\'s life time and the authority and power enjoyed by them
    after him, that is, at one time in the days of the Prophet no heed
    was paid to them because of \`Ali\'s personality but now the time
    had so changed that the same people were masters of the affairs of
    the Muslim world.

-  When \`Umar was
    wounded by Abu Lu\'lu\'ah and he saw that it was difficult for him
    to survive because of the deep wound, he formed a consultative
    committee and nominated for it \`Ali ibn Abi Talib, \`Uthman ibn
    \`Affan, \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn \`Awf, az-Zubayr ibn al-\`Awwam, Sa\`d
    ibn Abi Waqqas, and Talhah ibn \`Ubaydillah and bound them that
    after three days of his death they should select one of themselves
    as the Caliph while for those three days Suhayb should act as
    Caliph. On receipt of these instructions some members of the
    committee requested him to indicate what ideas he had about each of
    them to enable them to proceed further in their light. \`Umar
    therefore disclosed his own view about each
    individual.]

    He said that Sa\`d was harsh-tempered and hot headed; \`Abd
    ar-Rahman was the Pharaoh of the community; az-Zubayr was, if
    pleased, a true believer but if displeased an unbeliever; Talhah was
    the embodiment of pride and haughtiness, if he was made caliph he
    would put the ring of the caliphate on his wife\'s finger while
    \`Uthman did not see beyond his kinsmen. As regards \`Ali he is
    enamoured of the Caliphate although I know that he alone can run it
    on right lines. Nevertheless, despite this admission, he thought it
    necessary to constitute the consultative Committee and in selecting
    its members and laying down the working procedure he made sure that
    the Caliphate would take the direction in which he wished to turn
    it.

    Thus, a man of ordinary prudence can draw the conclusion that all
    the factors for \`Uthman\'s success were present therein. If we look
    at its members we see that one of them namely \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn
    \`Awf is the husband of \`Uthman\'s sister, next Sa\`d ibn Abi
    Waqqas besides bearing malice towards \`Ali is a relation and
    kinsman of \`Abd ar-Rahman. Neither of them can be taken to go
    against \`Uthman. The third Talhah ibn \`Ubaydillah about whom Prof.
    Muhammad \`Abduh writes in his annotation on Nahjul Balaghah:

    Talhah was inclined towards \`Uthman and the reason for it was no
    less than that he was against \`Ali, because he himself was at
    at-Taymi and Abu Bakr\'s accession to the Caliphate had created bad
    blood between Bani Taym and Banu Hashim.

    As regards az-Zubayr, even if he had voted for \`Ali, what could his
    single vote achieve. According to at-Tabari\'s statement Talhah was
    not present in Medina at that time but his absence did not stand in
    the way of \`Uthman\'s success. Rather even if he were present, as
    he did actually reach at the meeting (of the Committee), and he is
    taken to be \`Ali\'s supporter, still there could be no doubt in
    \`Uthman\'s success because \`Umar\'s sagacious mind had set the
    working procedure that:

    If two agree about one and the other two about another then
    \`Abdullah ibn \`Umar should act as the arbitrator. The group whom
    he orders should choose the Caliph from among themselves. If they do
    not accept \`Abdullah ibn \`Umar\'s verdict, support should be given
    to the group which includes \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn \`Awf, but if the
    others do not agree they should be beheaded for opposing this
    verdict. (at-Tabari, vol.1, pp.2779-2780; Ibn al-Athir, vol.3,
    p.67).

    Here disagreement with the verdict of \`Abdullah ibn \`Umar has no
    meaning since he was directed to support the group which included
    \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn \`Awf. He had ordered his son \`Abdullah and
    Suhayb that: 'If the people differ, you should side with the
    majority, but if three of them are on one side and the other three
    on the other, you should side with the group including \`Abd
    ar-Rahman ibn \`Awf'. (at-Tabari, vol.1, pp.2725,2780; Ibn al-Athir,
    vol.3, pp.51,67).

    In this instruction the agreement with the majority also means
    support of \`Abd ar-Rahman because the majority could not be on any
    other side since fifty blood-thirsty swords had been put on the
    heads of the opposition group with orders to fall on their heads on
    \`Abd ar-Rahman\'s behest. Amir al-mu\'minin\'s eye had fore-read it
    at that very moment that the Caliphate was going to \`Uthman as
    appears from his following words which he spoke to al-\`Abbas ibn
    \`Abd al-Muttalib:

    \"The Caliphate has been turned away from us.\" al-\`Abbas asked how
    could he know it. Then he replied, \"\`Uthman has also been coupled
    with me and it has been laid down that the majority should be
    supported; but if two agree on one and two on the other, then
    support should be given to the group which includes \`Abd ar-Rahman
    ibn \`Awf. Now Sa\`d will support his cousin \`Abd ar-Rahman who is
    of course the husband of \`Uthman\'s sister.\" (ibid )

    However, after \`Umar\'s death this meeting took place in the room
    of \`A\'ishah and on its door stood Abu Talhah al-Ansari with fifty
    men having drawn swords in their hands. Talhah started the
    proceedings and inviting all others to be witness said that he gave
    his right of vote to \`Uthman. This touched az-Zubayr\'s sense of
    honour as his mother Safiyyah daughter of \`Abd al-Muttalib was the
    sister of Prophet\'s father. So he gave his right of vote to \`Ali.

    Thereafter Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas made his right of vote to \`Abd
    ar-Rahman. This left three members of the consultative committee out
    of whom \`Abd ar-Rahman said that he was willing to give up his own
    right of vote if \`Ali (p.b.u.h.) and \`Uthman gave him the right to
    choose one of them or one of these two should acquire this right by
    withdrawing. This was a trap in which \`Ali had been entangled from
    all sides namely that either he should abandon his own right or else
    allow \`Abd ar-Rahman to do as he wished. The first case was not
    possible for him; that is, to give up his own right and elect
    \`Uthman or \`Abd ar-Rahman.

    So, he clung to his right, while \`Abd ar-Rahman separating himself
    from it assumed this power and said to Amir al-mu\'minin, \"I pay
    you allegiance on your following the Book of Allah, the sunnah of
    the Prophet and the conduct of the two Shaykhs, (Abu Bakr and
    \`Umar). \`Ali replied, \"Rather on following the Book of Allah, the
    sunnah of the Prophet and my own findings.\" When he got the same
    reply even after repeating the question thrice he turned to \`Uthman
    saying, \"Do you accept these conditions.\" He had no reason to
    refuse and so he agreed to the conditions and allegiance was paid to
    him. When Amir al mu\'minin saw his rights being thus trampled he
    said: \"This is not the first day when you behaved against us. I
    have only to keep good patience. Allah is the Helper against
    whatever you say. By Allah, you have not made \`Uthman Caliph but in
    the hope that he would give back the Caliphate to you.\"

    After recording the events of ash-Shura (consultative committee),
    Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid has written that when allegiance had been paid to
    \`Uthman, \`Ali addressed \`Uthman and \`Abd ar-Rahman saying, \"May
    Allah sow the seed of dissension among you,\" and so it happened
    that each turned a bitter enemy of the other and \`Abd ar-Rahman did
    not ever after speak to \`Uthman till death. Even on death bed he
    turned his face on seeing him.

    On seeing these events the question arises whether ash-Shura
    (consultative committee) means confining the matter to six persons,
    thereafter to three and finally to one only. Also whether the
    condition of following the conduct of the two Shaykhs for Caliphate
    was put by \`Umar or it was just a hurdle put by \`Abd ar-Rahman
    between \`Ali (p.b.u.h.) and the Caliphate, although the first
    Caliph did not put forth this condition at the time of nominating
    the second Caliph, namely that he should follow the former\'s
    footsteps. What then was the occasion for this condition here?

    However, Amir al-mu\'minin had agreed to participate in it in order
    to avoid mischief and to put an end to arguing so that others should
    be silenced and should not be able to claim that they would have
    voted in his favour and that he himself evaded the consultative
    committee and did not give them an opportunity of selecting him.

-  About the reign
    of the third Caliph, Amir al-mu\'minin says that soon on \`Uthman\'s
    coming to power Banu Umayyah got ground and began plundering the
    Bayt al-mal (public fund), and just as cattle on seeing green grass
    after drought trample it away, they recklessly fell upon Allah\'s
    money and devoured it. At last this self-indulgence and nepotism
    brought him to the stage when people besieged his house, put him to
    sword and made him vomit all that he had
    swallowed.]

    The maladministration that took place in this period was such that
    no Muslim can remain unmoved to see that Companions of high position
    were lying uncared for, they were stricken with poverty and
    surrounded by pennilessness while control over Bayt al-mal (public
    fund) was that of Banu Umayyah, government positions were occupied
    by their young and inexperienced persons, special Muslim properties
    were owned by them, meadows provided grazing but to their cattle,
    houses were built but by them, and orchards were but for them. If
    any compassionate person spoke about these excesses his ribs were
    broken, and if someone agitated this capitalism he was externed from
    the city. The uses to which zakat and charities which were meant for
    the poor and the wretched and the public fund which was the common
    property of the Muslims were put may be observed from the following
    few illustrations;

    1\) al-Hakam ibn Abi\'l-\`As who had been exiled from Medina by the
    Prophet was allowed back in the city not only against the Prophet\'s
    sunnah but also against the conduct of the first two Caliphs and he
    was paid three hundred thousand Dirhams from the public fund. (Ansab
    al-ashraf, vol.5, pp.27, 28, 125)

    2\) al-Walid ibn \`Uqbah who has been named hypocrite in the Qur\'an
    was paid one hundred thousand Dirhams from the Muslim\'s public
    fund. (al-\`Iqd al-farid, vol.3, p.94)

    3\) The Caliph married his own daughter Umm Aban to Marwan ibn
    al-Hakam and paid him one hundred thousand Dirhams from the public
    fund. (Sharh of Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid, vol.1, pp.198-199).\
    4) He married his daughter \`A\'ishah to Harith ibn al-Hakam and
    granted him one hundred thousand Dirhams from the public fund.
    (ibid.)

    5\) \`Abdullah ibn Khalid was paid four hundred thousand Dirhams.
    (al-Ma\`arif of Ibn Qutaybah, p.84)

    6\) Allowed the khums (one fifth religious duty) from Africa
    (amounting to five hundred thousand Dinars) to Marwan ibn al-Hakam.
    (ibid)

    7\) Fadak which was withheld from the angelic daughter of the
    Prophet on the ground of being general charity was given as a royal
    favour to Marwan ibn al-Hakam. (ibid.)

    8\) Mahzur a place in the commercial area of Medina which had been
    declared a public trust by the Prophet was gifted to Harith ibn
    al-Hakam. (ibid.)

    10\) After his death (\`Uthman\'s) one hundred and fifty thousand
    Dinars (gold coins) and one million Dirhams (silver coins) were
    found in his house. There was no limit to tax free lands; and the
    total value of the landed estate he owned in Wadi al-Qura and Hunayn
    was one hundred thousand Dinars. There were countless camels and
    horses. (Muruj adh-dhahab, vol.l, p.435)

    11\) The Caliph\'s relations ruled all the principal cities. Thus,
    at Kufah, al-Walid ibn \`Uqbah was the governor but when in the
    state of intoxication of wine he led the morning prayer in four
    instead of two rak\`ah and people agitated he was removed, but the
    Caliph put in his place a hypocrite like Sa\`id ibn al-\`As. In
    Egypt \`Abdullah ibn Sa\`d ibn Abi Sarh, in Syria Muawiyah ibn Abi
    Sufyan, and in Basrah, \`Abdullah ibn \`Amir were the governors
    appointed by him (ibid.)
