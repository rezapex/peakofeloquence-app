About Allah's greatness and lowliness of this world
Praise is due to Allah from Whose mercy no one loses hope, from Whose bounty no one is
deprived, from Whose forgiveness no one is disappointed and for Whose worship no one is
too high. His mercy never ceases and His bounty is never missed.
This world is a place for which destruction is ordained and for its inhabitants departure from
here is destined. It is sweet and green. It hastens towards its seeker and attaches to the heart of
the viewer. So depart from here with the best of provision available with you and do not ask
herein more than what is enough and do not demand from it more than subsistence.
