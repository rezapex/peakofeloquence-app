After swearing of allegiance to Amir al-mu'minin, some people from among the
companions of the Prophet said to him, "You should punish the people who assaulted
`Uthman," whereupon he said:
O' my brothers! I am not ignorant of what you know, but how do I have the power for it while
those who assaulted him are in the height of their power. They have superiority over us, not
we over them. They are now in the position that even your slaves have risen with them and
Bedouin Arabs too have joined them. They are now among you and are harming you as they
like. Do you see any way to be able to do what you aim at?
This demand is certainly that of the pre-Islamic (al-jahiliyyah) period and these people have
support behind them. When the matter is taken up, people will have different views about it.
One group will think as you do, but another will not think as you think, and there will be still
another group who will be neither this way nor that way. Be patient till people quieten down
and hearts settle in their places so that rights can be achieved for people easily.
Rest assured from me, and see what is given to you by me. Do not do anything which shatters
your power, weakens your strength and engenders feebleness and disgrace. I shall control this
affair as far as possible, but if I find it necessary the last treatment will, of course, be branding
with a hot iron (through fighting).
