Against misplaced generosity
He who shows generosity to those who have no claim to it or who are not fit for it would not
earn anything except the praise of the ignoble and appreciation of bad persons, although as
long s he continues giving, the ignorant will say how generous his hand is, even though in the
affairs of Allah he is a miser.
Therefore, to whosoever Allah gives wealth he should use it in extending good behaviour to
his kinsmen, in entertaining, in releasing prisoners and the afflicted; in giving to the poor and
to debtors, and he should endure (the troubles arising out of) the fulfilment of rights (of
others) and hardships in expectation of reward.
Certainly, the achievement of these qualities is the height of greatness in this world and
achievement of the distinctions of the next world; if Allah so wills.
