When the Kharijites persisted in their rejecting the Arbitration, Amir al-mu'minin went
to their camp and addressed them thus:
Were all of you (1) with us in Siffin? They replied that some of them were but some of them
were not. Amir al-mu'minin said:
Then you divide yourselves into two groups. One of those who were in Siffin and other of
those who were not present there, so that I may address each as I see suitable. Then he
shouted to the people:
Stop talking and keep quiet to listen to what I say. Turn your hearts to me. Whomever we ask
for evidence, he should give it according to his knowledge about it.
Then he had a long conversation with them during which he said:
When they had raised the Qur'an by way of deceit, craft, artifice and cheat, did you not say
"They are our brothers and our comrades in accepting Islam.
They want us to cease fighting, and ask for protection through the Book of Allah, the
Glorified. Our opinion is to agree with them and to end their troubles." Then I said to you, "In
this affair the outer side is Faith but the inner side is enmity.
Its beginning is pity and the end is repentance. Consequently you should stick to your
position, and remain steadfast on your path. You should press your teeth (to put all your
might) in jihad and should not pay heed to the shouts of the shouter (2). If he is answered he
would mislead, but if he is left (unanswered) he would be disgraced."
But when this thing (Arbitration) was done I found that you agreed to it. By Allah, if I had
refused it, it would not have been obligatory on me. Nor would Allah have laid its sin on me.
And by Allah, not that I have accepted it, I alone am the rightful person who should be
followed, for certainly the Qur'an is with me. I never forsake it since I adopted its company.
We have been with the Prophet in battles wherein those killed were fathers, sons, brothers and
relations of one another. Nevertheless, every trouble and hardship just increased us in our
belief, in our treading on the right path, in submission to (divine) command and in endurance
of the pain of wounds.
We now had to fight our brethren in Islam because of entry into Islam of misguidance,
crookedness, doubts and (wrong) interpretation. However, if we find any way by which Allah
may collect us together in our disorder and by which we may come near each other in
whatever common remains between us we would accept it and would give up everything else.
(1). Ibn Abi'l-Hadid writes that this sermon comprises three parts which do not fit together,
because as-Sayyid ar-Radi selected some parts of Amir al-mu'minin's sermons and did not
record other parts as a result of which the continuity of utterance was not maintained.
Thus, one part ends at "if he is left unanswered he would be disgraced", the other at "and
endurance at the pain of wound" and the third runs till the end of the sermon. (2). This
reference is to Mu`awiyah or `Amr ibn al-`As.
