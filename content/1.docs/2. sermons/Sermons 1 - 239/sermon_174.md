On eligibility for the Caliphate
The Prophet is the trustee of Allah's revelation, the Last of His Prophets. the giver of tidings
of His mercy and the warner for His chastisement.
O' people. the most rightful of all persons for this matter (namely the caliphate) is he who is
most competent among them to maintain it, and he who knows best Allah's commands about
it. If any mischief is created by a mischief-monger, he will be called upon to repent. If he
refuses. he will be fought. By my life, (1) if the question of Imamah was not to be decided
unless all the people were present, then there would be no such case.
But those who agreed about it imposed the decision on those who were absent, so much so
that he who was present could not dissent and the one who was absent could not choose (any
one else). Know that I shall fight two persons - one who claims what is not his and the other
who ignores what is obligatory upon him.
The need for sagacity in fighting against Muslims
O' creatures of Allah! I advise you to have fear of Allah because it is the best advice to be
mutually given by persons, and the best of all things before Allah.
The door of war has been opened between you and the other Muslims. And this banner will
be borne only by him who is a man of sight, of endurance and of knowledge of the position of
rightfulness.
Therefore, you should go ahead with what you are ordered and desist from what you are
refrained. Do not make haste in any matter till you have clarified it. For in the case of every
matter which you dislike we have a right to change it.
The behaviour of this world with its adherents
Know that this world which you have started to covet and in which you are interested, and
which sometimes enrages you and sometimes pleases you is not your (permanent) abode, nor
the place of your stay for which you might have been created, nor one to which you have been
invited. Know that it will not last for you nor will you live along with it.
If anything out of this world deceives you (into attraction), its evils warn you too. You should
give up (the objects of) its deceits in favour of (the objects of) its warning and (the objects of)
its attractions in favour of (the objects of) its terrors.
And while here in it, advance towards that house to which you have been called, and turn
away your hearts from the world. None of you should cry like a maid slave over anything
which she has been deprived of.
Seek the perfection of Allah's bounty over you by endurance in obedience to Allah and in
guarding what He has asked you to guard, namely His Book.
Know that the loss of anything of this world will not harm you, if you have guarded the
principles of your religion. Know also that after the loss of your religion nothing of this world
for which you have cared will benefit you. May Allah carry our hearts and your hearts
towards the right and may He grant us and you endurance.
(1). When the people collected in the Saqifah of Banu Sa`idah in connection with the election,
even those who were not present there were made to follow the decision taken there, and the
principle was adopted that those present at the election had no right to reconsider the matter
or to break the allegiance and those not present could do nothing but acquiesce in the agreed
decision.
But when the people of Medina swore allegiance at the hands of Amir al-mu'minin, the
Governor of Syria (Mu`awiyah) refused to follow suit on the ground that since he was not
present on the occasion he was not bound to abide by it, whereupon Amir al-mu'minin gave a
reply in this sermon on the basis of these accepted and agreed principles and conditions which
had been established among these people and had become incontrovertible namely that:
"When the people of Medina and the ansar and the muhajirun have sworn allegiance on my
hand, Mu`awiyah had no right to keep aloof from it on the ground that he was not present on
the occasions nor were Talhah and az-Zubayr entitled to break the pledge after swearing
allegiance."
On this occasion, Amir al-mu'minin did not argue on the strength of any saying of the Prophet
which would serve as his final say about the caliphate, because the grounds for refusal in his
case was in respect of the modus operandi of the principle of election. Therefore, in keeping
with the requirements of the situation a reply based on the agreed principles of the adversary
could alone quieten him. Even if he had argued on the strength of the Prophet's command it
would have been subjected to various interpretations and the matter would have been
prolonged instead of being settled.
Again Amir al-mu'minin had seen that soon after the death of the Prophet all his sayings and
commands had been set aside. Therefore, how after the lapse of a long time, could one be
expected to accept it when habit had been established to follow one's free will against the
Prophet's sayings.
