Delivered at the battle of Siffin
Mutual rights of the ruler and the ruled
So now, Allah, the Glorified, has, by placing me over your affairs,created my right over you,
and you too have a right over me like mineover you. A right is very vast in description but
very narrow in equitability of action. It does not accrue to any person unless it accrues against
him also, and right does not accrue against a person unless it also accrues in his favour.
If there is any right which is only in favour of a person with no (corresponding) right accruing
against him it is solely for Allah, the Glorified, and not for His creatures by virtue of His
might over His creatures and by virtue of the justice permeating all His decrees.
Of course, He the Glorified, has created His right over creatures that they should worship
Him, and has laid upon Himself (the obligation of) their reward equal to several times the
recompense as a mark of His bounty and the generosity that He is capable of.
Then, from His rights, He, the Glorified, created certain rights for certain people against
others. He made them so as to equate with one another. Some of these rights produce other
rights. Some rights are such that they do not accrue except with others. The greatest of these
rights that Allah, the Glorified, has made obligatory is the right of the ruler over the ruled and
the right of the ruled over the ruler.
This is an obligation which Allah, the Glorified, has placed on each other. He has made it the
basis of their (mutual) affection, and an honour for their religion. Consequently, the ruled
cannot prosper unless the rulers are sound, while the rulers cannot be sound unless the ruled
are steadfast.
If the ruled fulfil the rights of the ruler and the ruler fulfils their rights, then right attains the
position of honour among them, the ways of religion become established, signs of justice
become fixed and the sunnah gains currency.
In this way time will improve, the continuance of government will be expected, and the aims
of the enemies will be frustrated. But if the ruled gain sway over the ruler, or the ruler
oppresses the ruled, then difference crops up in every word, signs of oppression appear,
mischief enters religion and the ways of the sunnah are forsaken.
Then desires are acted upon, the commands (of religion) are discarded, diseases of the spirit
become numerous and there is no hesitation in disregarding even great rights, nor in
committing big wrongs. In such circumstances, the virtuous are humiliated while the vicious
are honoured, and there are serious chastisements from Allah, the Glorified, onto the people.
You should therefore counsel each other (for the fulfilment of your obligations) and cooperate
with each other. However extremely eager a person may be to secure the pleasure of
Allah, and however fully he strives for it, he cannot discharge (his obligation for) obedience
to Allah, the Glorified, as is really due to Him, and it is an obligatory right of Allah over the
people that they should advise each other to the best of their ability and co-operate with each
other for the establishment of truth among them.
No person, however great his position in the matter of truth, and however advanced his
distinction in religion may be, is above co-operation in connection with the obligations placed
on him by Allah. Again, no man, however small he may be regarded by others, and however
humble he may appear before eyes, is too low to co-operate or to be afforded co-operation in
this matter.
One of Amir al-mu'minin's companions replied to him by a long speech wherein he praised
him much and mentioned his own listening to him and obeying him, whereupon Amir almu'minin
said:
If a man in his mind regards Allah's glory as being high and believes in his heart that Allah's
position is sublime, then it is his right that on account of the greatness of these things he
should regard all other things small. Among such persons he on whom Allah's bounty is great
and Allah's favours are kind has a greater obligation, because Allah's bounty over any person
does not increase without an increase in Allah's right over him.
In the view of virtuous people, the worst position of rulers is that it may be thought about
them that they love glory, and their affairs may be taken to be based on pride. I would really
hate that it may occur to your mind that I love high praises or to hear eulogies. By the grace of
Allah I am not like this. Even If I had loved to be mentioned like this, I would have given it
up in submissiveness before Allah, the Glorified, rather than accept greatness and sublimity to
which He is more entitled.
Generally, people feel pleased at praise after good performances; but do not mention for me
handsome praise for the obligations I have discharged towards Allah and towards you,
because of (my) fear about those obligations which I have not discharged and for issuing
injunctions which could not be avoided, and do not address me in the manner despots are
addressed.
Do not evade me as the people of passion are (to be) evaded, do not meet me with flattery and
do not think that I shall take it ill if a true thing is said to me, because the person who feels
disgusted when truth is said to him or a just matter is placed before him would find it more
difficult to act upon them.
Therefore, do not abstain from saying a truth or pointing out a matter of justice because I do
not regard myself above erring (1). I do not escape erring in my actions but that Allah helps
me (in avoiding errors) in matters in which He is more powerful than I.
Certainly, I and you are slaves owned by Allah, other than Whom there is no Lord except
Him. He owns our selves which we do not own. He took us from where we were towards
what means prosperity to us. He altered our straying into guidance and gave us intelligence
after blindness.
(1). That the innocence of angels is different from the innocence of manneeds no detailed
discussion. The innocence of angels means that they do not possess the impulse to sin, but the
innocence of man means that, although he has human frailties and passions, yet he possesses
a peculiar power to resist them and he is not over-powered by them so as to commit sins.
This very ability is called innocence and it prevents the rising up of personal passions and
impulses. Amir al-mu'minin's saying that "I do not regard myself above erring" refers to those
human dictates and passions, and his saying that "Allah helps me in avoiding 'errors'" refers to
innocence.
The same tone is found in the Qur'an in the words of Prophet Yusuf that:
I exculpate not myself, verily (one's) self is wont to bid (him to) evil, except such
as my Lord hath had mercy on; verily my Lord is Oft- forgiving, All-merciful.
(12:53)
Just as in this verse, because of the existence of exception, its firstpart cannot be used to
argue against his innocence, similarly, due to the existence of the exception "but that Allah
helps me in avoiding errors" in Amir al-mu'minin's saying, its first part cannot be used to argue
against his innocence, otherwise the Prophet's innocence too will have to be rejected.
In the same way, the last sentence of this sermon should not be taken to mean that before the
proclamation of prophethood he had been under the influence of pre-Islamic beliefs, and that
just as others had been unbelievers he too might have been in darkness and misguidance,
because from his very birth Amir al-mu'minin was brought-up by the Prophet and the effect of
his training and up-bringing permeated him.
It cannot therefore be imagined that he who had from infancy trod in the foot-prints of the
Prophet would deviate from guidance even for a moment. Thus, al-Mas`udi has written:
Amir al-mu'minin never believed in any other god than Allah so that there could
be the question of his accepting Islam. He rather followed the Prophet in all his
actions and (virtually) initiated him, and in this very state he attained majority.
(Muruj adh-dhahab, vol. 2, p. 3).
Here, by those whom Allah led from darkness into guidance, the reference is to the persons
whom Amir al-muíminin was addressing. Ibn Abiíl-Hadid writes in this connection:
The reference here is not to his own self because he had never been an
unbeliever so as to have accepted Islam after that, but in these words he is
referring to those group of people whom he was addressing. (Sharh Nahj albalaghah,
vol. 11, p. 108)
