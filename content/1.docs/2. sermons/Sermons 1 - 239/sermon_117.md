description: This is sermon 117

About troubles which would arise and the Day of Judgement
Allah deputised him (the Prophet) as a caller towards Truth and a witness over the creatures.
The Prophet conveyed the messages of Allah without being lazy and without any shortcoming,
and he fought His enemies in the cause of Allah without being languid and without
pleading excuses.
He is the foremost of all who practise piety and the power of perception of all those who
achieve guidance.
A part of the same sermon, complaining about his men
If you know what I know of the unknown that is kept wrapped up from you certainly you
would have gone out into the open weeping over your deeds and beating yourselves in grief
and you would have abandoned your properties without any guard for it or any substitute over
it. Everyone would then have cared for his own self without paying attention to anyone else.
But you have forgotten what was recalled to you and felt safe from what you had been
warned. Consequently, your ideas went astray and your affairs were dispersed.
I do long that Allah may cause separation between me and you and give me those who have a
better right to be with me than you. By Allah, they are people of blissful ideas, enduring
wisdom and true speech.
They keep aloof from revolt. They trod forward on the path (of Allah) and ran on the high
road. Consequently, they achieved the everlasting next life and easeful honours.
Beware! by Allah, a tall lad of swinging gait from Banu Thaqif would be placed over you. He
would eat away your vegetation and melt your fat. So, O' Aba Wadhahah, is that all?
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: "al-Wadhahah" means "al-khunfusa' (dung-beetle)." In this sentence
Amir al-mu'minin has referred to al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath-Thaqafi and he had an incident with
"al-Khunfusa '", which need not be related here.(1)
(1). The detail of this incident is that one day al-Hajjaj stood up for saying prayers when alkhunfusa'
advanced towards him. al-Hajjaj held out his hand to stop him but he bit him
whereby his hand got swollen and eventually he died of it. Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written that "al-
Wadhahah" means the dung that remains sticking to the tail of an animal, and this surname is
intended to disgrace him.
