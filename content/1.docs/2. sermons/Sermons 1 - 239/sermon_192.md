Praise of Allah
Praise be to Allah Whose praise is wide-spread, Whose army is over-powering and Whose
dignity is grand. I praise Him for His successive favours and His great gifts. His forbearance
is high so that He forgives and is just in whatever He decides.
He knows what is going on and what has already passed. He crafted all creation by His
knowledge and produced it by His intelligence without limitation, without learning, without
following the example of any intelligent producer, without committing any mistake and
without the availability of any group (for help); I stand witness that Muhammad - the peace
and blessing of Allah be upon him and his descendants - is His slave and His messenger
whom He deputed (at a time) when people were collecting in the abyss and moving in
bewilderment.
The reins of destruction were dragging them, and the locks of malice lay fixed on their hearts.
Advice about fear of Allah and an account of this world and its people
I advise you, O' creature of Allah, that you should have fear of Allah because it is a right of
Allah over you and it creates your right over Allah, and that you should seek Allah's help in it,
and its help in (meeting) Allah. Certainly, for today fear of Allah is a protection and a shield,
and for tomorrow (the Day of Judgement) it is the road to Paradise. Its way is clear and he
who treads it is the gainer. Whoever holds it, guards it.
It has presented itself to the people who have already passed and to those coming from
behind, because they will need it tomorrow (on the Day of Judgement) when Allah will revive
His creation again, take back what He has given and take account of what He has bestowed.
How few will be those who accept it and practise it as it ought to be practised. They will be
very few in number, and they are the people who correspond to the description given by
Allah, the Glorified, when He says:
... And very few of My creatures are grateful! (Qur'an. 34:13)
Therefore, hasten with your ears towards it and intensify your efforts for it. Make it a
substitute for all your past (short-comings) to take their place as a successor, and make it your
supporter against every opponent. Turn your sleep into wakefulness by its help, and pass your
days with it. Make it the equipment of your hearts, wash your sins with it, treat your ailments
with it and hasten towards your death with it.
Take a lesson from him who neglects it, so that others who follow it should not take a lesson
from you (i.e., from your neglecting it). Beware, therefore; you should take care of it and
should take care of yourselves through it.
Keep away from this world and proceed towards the next world infatuatedly. Do not regard
humble he whom fear Allah has given a high position, and do not accord a high position to
him whom this world has given a high position.
Do not keep your eyes on the shining clouds of the world, do not listen to him who speaks of
it, do not respond to him who calls towards it, do not seek light from its glare, and do not die
in its precious things, because its brightness is deceitful, its words are false, its wealth is liable
to be looted, and its precious thing are to be taken away.
Beware, this world attracts and then turns away. It is stubborn, refusing to go ahead. It speaks
lies and misappropriates. It disowns and is ungrateful. It is malicious and abandons (its
lovers).
It attracts but causes trouble. Its condition is changing, its step shaking, its honour disgrace,
its seriousness jest, and its height lowliness. It is a place of plunder and pillage, and ruin and
destruction. Its people are ready with their feet to drive, to overtake and to depart.
Its routes are bewildering, its exits are baffling, and its schemes end in disappointment.
Consequently, strongholds betray them, houses throw them out and cunning fails them.
Some of them are like hocked camel, some like butchered meat, some like severed limbs,
some like spilt blood, some are biting their hands (in pain) some are rubbing their palms (in
remorse), some are holding their cheeks on their hands (in anxiety), some are cursing their
own views and some are retreating from their determination.
But the time for action has gone away and the hour of calamity has approached, while (there
was no longer) the time to escape (Qur'an, 38:3). Alas! Alas! what has been lost is lost! what
has gone is gone! The world has passed in its usual manner.
So wept not on them the heavens and the earth nor were they respited. (Qur'an,
44:29)
