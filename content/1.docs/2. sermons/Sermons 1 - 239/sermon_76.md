description: This is sermon 76

When Amir al-mu'minin learnt that the Umayyads blamed him for
killing `Uthman, he said:
Umayyads's knowledge about me did not desist them from accusing me, nor did my
precedence (in accepting Islam) keep off these ignorant people from blaming me.
Allah's admonitions are more eloquent than my tongue. I am the contester against those who
break away from Faith and the opposer of those who entertain doubts. Uncertainties should be
placed before Qur'an, the Book of Allah (for clarification).
Certainly, people will be recompensed according to what they have in their hearts.
