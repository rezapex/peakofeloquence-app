The greatness of Allah and the creation of the Universe
It is through the strength of Allah's greatness and His subtle power of innovation that He
made solid dry earth out of the water of the fathomless, compact and dashing ocean. Then He
made from it layers and separated them into seven skies after they had been joined together.
So, they became stationary at His command and stopped at the limit fixed by Him. He so
made the earth that it is born by deep blue, surrounded and suspended water which is obedient
to His command and has submitted to His awe while its flow has stopped due to fear of Him.
He also created high hills, rocks of stones and lofty mountains. He put them in their positions
and made them remain stationary. Their peaks rose into the air while their roots remained in
the water. In this way He raised the mountains above the plains and fixed their foundations in
the vast expanse wherever they stood.
He made their peaks high and made their bodies lofty. He made them like pillars for the earth
and fixed them in it like pegs. Consequently, the earth became stationary; otherwise it might
bend with its inhabitants or sink inwards with its burden, or shift from its positions.
Therefore, glorified is He who stopped it after the flowing of its waters and solidified it after
the watery state of its sides. In this way He made it a cradle for His creatures and spread it for
them in the form of a floor over the deep ocean which is stationary and does not move and is
fixed and does not flow. Severe winds move it here and there and clouds draw up water from
it.
Verily in this there is a lesson unto him who feareth (Allah) (Qur'an, 79:26)
