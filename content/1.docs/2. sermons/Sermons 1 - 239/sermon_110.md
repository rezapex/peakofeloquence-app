About the Might of Allah
Everything submits to Him and everything exists by Him. He is the satisfaction of every poor,
dignity of the low, energy for the weak and shelter for the oppressed.
Whoever speaks, He hears his speaking, and whoever keeps quiet, He knows his secret. On
Him is the livelihood of everyone who lives, and to Him returns whoever dies.
(O' Allah!) The eyes have not seen Thee so as to be aware of Thee, but Thou wert before the
describers of Thy creation. Thou didst not create the creation on account of loneliness, nor
didst make them work for gain. He whom Thou catchest cannot go farther than Thee, and he
whom Thou holdest cannot escape Thee. He who disobeys Thee does not decrease Thy
authority, and he who obeys Thee does not add to Thy Might. He who disagrees with Thy
judgement cannot turn it, and he who turns away from Thy command cannot do without Thee.
Every secret before Thee is open and for Thee every absent is present.
Thou art everlasting, there is no end to Thee. Thou art the highest aim, there is no escape from
Thee, Thou art the promised (point of return) from which there is no deliverance except
towards Thee. In Thy hand is the forelock of every creature and to Thee is the return of every
living being.
Glory to Thee! How great is Thy creation that we see, but how small is this greatness by the
side of Thy Might. How awe-striking is Thy realm that we notice, but how humble is this
against what is hidden from us out of Thy authority. How extensive are Thy bounties in this
world, but how small are they against the bounties of the next world.
A part of the same sermon about the Angels
Thou (O' Allah) made angels reside in Thy skies and place them high above from Thy earth.
They have the most knowledge about Thee and Thy whole creation, the most fearing from
Thee, and the nearest to Thee. They never stayed in loins nor were retained in wombs. They
were not created "from mean water (semen)" (Qur'an , 32:8; 77:20). They were not dispersed
by vicissitudes of time. They are on their places (distinct) from Thee and in their positions
near Thee. Their desires are concentrated in Thee. Their worship for Thee is much. Their
neglect from Thy command is little.
If they witness what remains hidden about Thee they would regard their deeds as very little,
they would criticise themselves and would realise that they did not worship Thee according to
Thy right for being worshipped and did not obey Thee as Thou hast the right of being obeyed.
About the bounties and guidance of Allah, and those who are ungrateful
Glorified art Thou, the Creator, the Worshipped, on account of Thy good trials of Thy
creatures. Thou created a house (the Paradise) and provided in it for feasting, drinks, foods,
spouses, servants, places, streams, plantations and fruits.
Then Thou sent a messenger to invite towards it, but the people did not respond to the caller,
and did not feel persuaded to what Thou persuaded them nor showed eagerness towards what
Thou desired them to feel eager. They jumped on the carcass (of this world), earned shame by
eating it and became united on loving it.
When one loves a thing it blinds him and sickens his heart. Then he sees but with a diseased
eye, hears but with unhearing ears. Desires have cut asunder his wit, and the world has made
his heart dead, while his mind is all longing for it. Consequently, he is a slave of it and of
everyone who has any share in it.
Wherever it turns, he turns towards it and wherever it proceeds, he proceeds towards it. He is
not desisted by any desister from Allah, nor takes admonition from any preacher. He sees
those who have been caught in neglect whence there is neither rescission nor reversion.
About Death
Whatever they were ignoring has befallen them, separation from this world, from which they
took themselves safe, has come to them and they have reached that in the next world which
they had been promised. Whatever has befallen them cannot be described. Pangs of death and
grief for losing (this world) have surrounded them.
Consequently, their limbs become languid and their complexion changes. Then death
increases its struggle over them.
In some one it stands in between him and his power of speaking although he lies among his
people, looking with eyes, hearing with his ears, with full wits and intelligence. He then
thinks over how he wasted his life and in what (activities) he passed his time. He recalls the
wealth he collected when he had blinded himself in seeking it, and acquired it from fair and
foul sources.
Now the consequences of collecting it have overtaken him. He gets ready to leave it. It would
remain for those who are behind him. They would enjoy it and benefit by it.
It would be an easy acquisition for others but a burden on his back, and the man cannot get rid
of it. He would thereupon bite his hands with teeth out of shame for what was disclosed to
him about his affairs at the time of his death.
He would dislike what he coveted during the days of his life and would wish that he who
envied him on account of it and felt jealous over him for it should have amassed it instead of
he himself.
Death would go on affecting his body till his ears too would behave like his tongue (and lose
functioning). So he would lie among his people, neither speaking with his tongue or hearing
with his ears.
He would be rotating his glance over their faces, watching the movements of their tongues,
but not hearing their speaking. Then death would increase its sway over him, and his sight
would be taken by death as the ears had been taken and the spirit would depart from his body.
He would then become a carcass among his own people.
They would feel loneliness from him and get away from near him. He would not join a
mourner or respond to a caller. Then they would carry him to a small place in the ground and
deliver him in it to (face) his deeds. They abandoned visiting him.
About the Day of Judgement
Till whatever is written as ordained approaches its end, the affairs complete their destined
limits, the posteriors join the anteriors and whatever Allah wills takes place in the shape of
resurrection of His creation. Then He would convulse the sky and split it.
He would quake the earth and shake it. He would root out the mountains and scatter them.
They would crush each other out of awe of His Glory and fear of His Dignity.
He would take out everyone who is in it. He would refresh them after they had been worn out
and collect them after they had been separated. Then He would set them apart for questioning
about the hidden deeds and secret acts. He would then divide them into two groups, rewarding
one and punishing the other.
As regards the obedient people He would reward them with His nearness and would keep
them for ever in His house from where those who settle therein do not move out. Their
position would not undergo change, fear would not overtake them, ailments would not befall
them, dangers would not affect them and journey would not force them (from place to place).
As for people of sins, He would settle them in the worst place, would bind their hands with
the necks, bind the forelocks with feet and would clothe them in shirts of tar and dresses cut
out of flames. They would be in punishment whose heat would be severe, door would be
closed on the inmates - in fire which is full of shouts and cries and rising flames and fearful
voices.
Its inmate does not move out of it. its prisoner cannot be released by ransom and its shackles
cannot be cut. There is no fixed age for this house so that it might perish, nor period for its
life that might pass away.
A part of the same sermon about the Holy Prophet
He treated this world disdainfully and regarded it low. He held it contemptible and hated it.
He realised that Allah kept it away from him with intention and spread it out for others by
way of contempt. Therefore, he remained away from it by his heart, banished its recollection
from his mind and wished that its attraction should remain hidden from his eye so that he
should not acquire any clothing from it, or hope for staying in it.
He conveyed from Allah the pleas (against committing sins), counselled his people as a
warner (against Divine chastisement) and called (people) towards Paradise as a conveyor of
good tidings.
About the Descendants of the Holy Prophet
We are the tree of prophethood, staying place of (Divine) Message, descending place of
angels, mines of knowledge and the sources of wisdom. Our supporter and lover awaits mercy
while our enemy and he who hates us awaits wrath.
