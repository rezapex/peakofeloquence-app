About heart's desires and extended hopes
O' people what I fear most about you are two things - acting according to desires and
extending of hopes. As regards acting according to desires, this prevents from truth; and as
regards extending of hopes, it makes one forget the next world.
You should know this world is moving rapidly and nothing has remained out of it except last
particles like the dregs of a vessel which has been emptied by someone. Beware, the next
world is advancing, and either of them has sons i.e. followers.
You should become sons of the next world and not become sons of this world because on the
Day of Judgement every son would cling to his mother. Today is the Day of action and there
is no reckoning while tomorrow is the Day of reckoning but there would be no (opportunity
for) action.
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: "al-hadhdha' " means rapid but some people have read it "jadhdha' ".
According to this version the meaning would be that the cycle of worldly enjoyments would
end soon.
