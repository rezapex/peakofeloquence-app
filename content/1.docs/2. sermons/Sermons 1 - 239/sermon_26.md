Exhorting people for jihad
By my life there will be no regard for anyone nor slackening from me in fighting against one
who opposes right or gropes in misguidance. O' creatures of Allah, fear Allah and flee unto
Allah from His wrath (seek protection in His Mercy).
Tread on the path He has laid down for you and stand by what He has enjoined upon you. In
that case `Ali would stand surety for your success (salvation) eventually even though you may
not get it immediately (i.e. in this world).
