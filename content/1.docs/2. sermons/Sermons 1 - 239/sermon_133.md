Warning about death and counselling
We praise Him for whatever He takes or gives or whatever He inflicts on us or tries us with.
He is aware of all that is hidden and He sees all that is concealed. He knows all that breasts
contain or eyes hide.
We render evidence that there is no god except He and that Muhammad - peace be upon him
and his progeny - has been chosen by Him and deputised by Him -evidence tendered both
secretly and openly, by heart and by tongue.
A part of the same sermon
By Allah, certainly it is reality not fun, truth not falsehood. It is none else than death. Its caller
is making himself heard and its dragsman is making haste. The majority of the people should
not deceive you. You have seen those who lived before you, amassed wealth, feared poverty
and felt safe from its (evil) consequences, the longevity of desires and the (apparent) distance
from death.
How, then, death overtook them, turned them out of their homelands and took them out of
their places of safety.
They were borne on coffins, people were busy about them one after another, carrying them on
their shoulders and supporting them with their hands.
Did you not witness those who engaged in long-reaching desires, built strong buildings,
amassed much wealth but their houses turned to graves and their collections turned into ruin.
Their property devolved on the successors and their spouses on those who came after them.
They cannot (now) add to their good acts nor invoke (Allah's) mercy in respect of evil acts.
Therefore, whoever makes his heart habituated to fear Allah achieves a forward position and
his action is successful. Prepare yourself for it and do all that you can for Paradise.
Certainly this world has not been made a place of permanent stay for you. But it has been
created as a pathway in order that you may take from it the provisions of your (good) actions
for the permanent house (in Paradise). Be ready for departure from here and keep close your
riding animals for setting off.
