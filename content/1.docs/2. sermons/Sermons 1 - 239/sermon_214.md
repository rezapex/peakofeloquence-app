The Sublimity of Allah and a eulogy of the Prophet
Praise be to Allah who is above all similarity to the creatures, is above the words of
describers, who displays the wonders of His management for the on-lookers, is hidden from
the imagination of thinkers by virtue of the greatness of His glory, has knowledge without
acquiring it, adding to it or drawing it (from someone), and Who is the ordainer of all matters
without reflecting or thinking.
He is such that gloom does not concern Him, nor does He seek light from brightness, night
does not overtake Him nor does the day pass over Him (so as to affect Him in any manner).
His comprehension (of things) is not through eyes and His knowledge is not dependent on
being informed.
A part of the same sermon about the Prophet
Allah deputised the Prophet with light, and accorded him the highest precedence in selection.
Through him Allah united those who were divided, overpowered the powerful, overcame
difficulties and levelled rugged ground, and thus removed misguidance from right and left.
