Cowardice of the people of Jamal
They (1) thunder like clouds and shone like lightning but despite both these things they
exhibited cowardice, while we do not thunder till we pounce upon the foe nor do we show
flow (of words) until we have not virtually rained.
(1). About the people of Jamal (i.e. the enemy in the battle of Jamal) Amir al-mu'minin says
that they rose thundering, shouting and stampeding but when encounter took place they were
seen flying like straw. At one time they made loud claims that they would do this and would do
that and now they showed such cowardice as to flee from the battle-field.
About himself Amir al-mu'minin says, that "We do not threaten the enemy before battle, nor
utter boasts, nor terrorise the enemy by raising unnecessary cries because it is not the way of
the brave to use the tongue instead of the hand." That is why on this occasion he said to his
comrades: "Beware of excessive talk as it is cowardice."
