Exhorting his men to jihad and asking them to refrain from seeking
ease
Allah seeks you to thank Him and assigns to you His affairs. He has allowed time in the
limited field (of life) so that you may vie with each other in seeking the reward (of Paradise).
Therefore, tight up your girdles and wrap up the skirts. High courage and dinners do not go
together. Sleep causes weakness in the big affairs of the day and (its) darkness obliterates the
memories of courage.
