After Amir al-mu'minin had sent Jarir ibn `Abdillah al-Bajali to Mu`awiyah (for securing his
allegiance) some of his companions suggested preparation to fight with him then he said:
My preparation for war with the people of Syria (ash-Sham) while Jarir ibn `Abdillah al-
Bajali is still there would be closing the door for Syria and prevention of its people from good
action (i.e. allegiance) if they intend doing it.
However, I have fixed a time limit for Jarir after which he would not stay without either
deception or in disobedience. My opinion is in favour of patience, so wait a while. (In the
meantime) I do not dislike your getting ready.
I have observed this matter thoroughly from all sides but I do not find any way except war or
heresy. Certainly, there was over the people a ruler (before me) who brought about new (un-
Islamic) things and compelled the people to speak out. So they did speak, then rose up and
thereafter changed the whole system.
