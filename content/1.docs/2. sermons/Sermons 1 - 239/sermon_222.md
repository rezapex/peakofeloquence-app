Delivered after reciting the verse:
. . . therein declare glory unto Him in the mornings and the evenings; Men
whom neither merchandise nor any sale diverteth from the remembrance of
Allah and constancy in prayer and paying the poor-rate; they fear the day when
the hearts and eyes shall writhe of the anguish. (Qur'an, 24:36-37)
Certainly, Allah, the Glorified, the Sublime, has made His remembrance the light for hearts
which hear with its help despite deafness, see with its help despite blindness and become
submissive with its help despite unruliness.
In all the periods and times when there were no prophets, there have been persons with whom
Allah, precious are His bounties, whispered through their wits and spoke through their minds.
With the help of the bright awakening of their ears, eyes and hearts they keep reminding
others of the remembrance of the days of Allah and making others feel fear for Him like
guide-points in wildernesses.
Whoever adopts the middle way, they praise his ways and give him the tidings of deliverance,
but whoever goes right and left they vilify his ways and frighten him with ruin. In this way,
they served as lamps in these darknesses and guides through these doubts.
There are some people devoted to the remembrance (of Allah) who have adopted it in place of
worldly matters so that commerce or trade does not turn them away from it. They pass their
life in it. They speak into the ears of neglectful persons warning against matters held unlawful
by Allah, they order them to practise justice and themselves keep practising it, and they
refrain them from the unlawful and themselves refrain from it. It is as though they have
finished the journey of this world towards the next world and have beheld what lies beyond it.
Consequently, they have become acquainted with all that befell them in the interstice during
their long stay therein, and the Day of Judgement fulfils its promises for them. Therefore,
they removed the curtain from these things for the people of the world, till it was as though
they were seeing what people did not see and were hearing what people did not hear.
If you picture them in your mind in their admirable positions and well-known sittings, when
they have opened the records of their actions and are prepared to render an account of
themselves in respect of the small as well as the big things they were ordered to do but they
failed to do, or were ordered to refrain from but they indulged therein, and they realised the
weight of their burden (of bad acts) on their backs, and they felt too weak to bear them, then
they wept bitterly and spoke to each other wile still crying and bewailing to Allah in
repentance and acknowledgement (of their shortcomings), you would find them to be
emblems of guidance and lamps in darkness, angels would be surrounding them, peace would
be descending upon them, the doors of the sky would be opened for them and positions of
honour would be assigned to them in the place of which Allah had informed them.
Therefore, He has appreciated their actions and praised their position.They call Him and
breathe in the air of forgiveness, they are ever needy of His bounty and remain humble before
His greatness, the length of their grief has pained their hearts, and the length of weeping their
eves. They knock at every door of inclination towards Allah. They ask Him Whom generosity
does not make destitute and from Whom those who approach Him do not get disappointed.
Therefore, take account of yourself for your own sake because the account of others will be
taken by one other than you.
