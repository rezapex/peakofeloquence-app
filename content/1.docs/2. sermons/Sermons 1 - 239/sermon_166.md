Describing the wonderful creation of the peacock
About the wonderful creation of birds
Allah has provided wonderful creations including the living, the lifeless, the stationary, and
the moving. He has established such clear proofs for His delicate creative power and great
might that minds bend down to Him in acknowledgement thereof and in submission to Him,
and arguments about His Oneness strike our ears.
He has created birds of various shapes which live in the burrows of the earth, in the openings
of high passes and on the peaks of mountains.
They have different kinds of wings, and various characteristics. They are controlled by the
rein of (Allah's) authority. They flutter with their wings in the expanse of the vast firmament
and the open atmosphere.
He brought them into existence from non-existence in strange external shapes, and composed
them with joints and bones covered with flesh.
He prevented some of them from flying easily in the sky because of their heavy bodies and
allowed them to use their wings only close to the ground. He has set them in different colours
by his delicate might and exquisite creative power.
Among them are those which are tinted with one hue and there is no other hue except the one
in which they have been dyed. There are others which are tinted with one colour, and they
have a neck ring of a different colour than that with which they are tinted.
About the Peacock
The most amazing among them in its creation is the peacock, which Allah has created in the
most symmetrical dimensions, and arranged its hues in the best arrangement with wings
whose ends are inter-leaved together and whose tail is long.
When it moves to its female it spreads out its folded tail and raises it up so as to cast a shade
over its head, as if it were the sail of a boat being pulled by the sailor. It feels proud of its
colours and swaggers with its movements. It copulates like the cocks. It leaps (on the female)
for fecundation like lustful energetic men at the time of fighting.
I am telling you all this from observation, unlike he who narrates on the basis of weak
authority, as for example, the belief of some people that it fecundates the female by a tear
which flows from its eyes and when it stops on the edges of the eyelids the female swallows it
and lays its eggs thereby and not through fecundation by a male other than by means of this
flowing tear.
Even if they say this, it would be no amazing than (what they say about) the mutual feeding of
the crows (for fecundation). You would imagine its feathers to be sticks made of silvers and
the wonderful circles and sun-shaped feathers growing thereon to be of pure gold and pieces
of green emerald.
If you likened them to anything growing on land, you would say that it is a bouquet of flowers
collected during every spring. If you likened them to cloths, they would be like printed
apparels or amazing variegated cloths of Yemen. If you likened them to ornaments then they
would be like gems of different colour with studded silver.
The peacock walks with vanity and pride, and throws open its tail and wings and laughs
admiring the handsomeness of its dress and the hues of its necklace of gems.
But when it casts its glance at its legs it cries loudly with a voice which indicates its call for
help and displays its true grief, because its legs are thin like the legs of Indo-Persian crossbred
cocks. At the end of its shin there is a thin thorn and on the crown of its head there is a
bunch of green variegated feathers.
Its neck begins in the shape of a goblet and its stretch up to its belly is like the hair-dye of
Yemen in colour or like silk cloth put on a polished mirror which looks as if it has been
covered with a black veil, except that on account of its excessive lustre and extreme
brightness it appears that a lush green colour has been mixed with it.
Along the openings of its ears there is a line of shining bright daisy colour like the thin end of
a pen. Whiteness shines on the black background.
There is hardly a hue from which it has not taken a bit and improved it further by regular
polish, lustre, silken brightness and brilliance.
It is therefore like scattered blossoms which have not been seasoned by the rains of spring or
the sun of the summer.
It also sheds its plumage and puts off its dress. They all fall away and grow again. They fall
way from the feather stems like the falling of leaves from twigs, and then they begin to join
together and grow till they return to the state that existed before their falling away.
The new hues do not change from the previous ones, nor does any colour occur in other than
its own place. If you carefully look at one hair from the hairs of its feather stems it would
look like red rose, then emerald green and then golden yellow.
How can sharpness of intellect describe such a creation, or faculty of mind, or the utterances
of describers manage to tell of it. Even its smallest parts have made it impossible for the
imagination to pick them out or for tongues to describe them.
Glorified is Allah who has disabled intellects from describing the creation which He placed
openly before the eyes and which they see bounded, shaped, arranged and coloured. He also
disabled tongues from briefly describing its qualities and also from expanding in its praise.
The magnificence of the Creator in great and small creation
Glorified is Allah who has assigned feet to small ants and gnats and also to those above them,
the serpents and the elephants. He has made it obligatory upon Himself that no skeleton in
which He infuses the spirit would move, but that death is its promised place and destruction
its final end.
A part of the same sermon
Describing Paradise
If you cast your mind's eye at what is described to you about Paradise, your heart would begin
to hate the delicacies of this world that have been displayed here, namely its desires and its
pleasures, and the beauties of its scenes, and you would be lost in the rustling of the trees
whose roots lie hidden in the mounds of musk on the banks of the rivers in Paradise and in the
attraction of the bunches of fresh pearls in the twigs and branches of those trees, and in the
appearance of different fruits from under the cover of their leaves.
These fruits can be picked without difficulty as they come down at the desire of their pickers.
Pure honey and fermented wine will be handed round to those who settle down in the
courtyards of its palaces.
They are a people whom honour has always followed till they were made to settle in the
house of eternal abode, and they obtained rest from the movement of journeying.
O' listener! If you busy yourself in advancing towards these wonderful scenes which will rush
towards you, then your heart will certainly die due to eagerness for them, and you will be
prepared to seek the company of those in the graves straight away from my audience here and
hasten towards them. Allah may, by His mercy, include us and you too among those who
strive with their hearts for the abodes of the virtuous.
Note explaining some of the wonderful and obscure portions of this sermon
As-Sayyid ar-Radi says: In Amir al-mu'minin's words "ya'urru bimalaqihihi", "al-arr" implies
"copulation", e.g. when it is said "arra'r-rajulu al-mar'ata ya'urruha", it means "He copulated
with the woman."
In his words "ka'annahu qal`u dariyyin `anajahu nutiyyuhu", "al-qal`" means the sail of a boat.
"dari" means belonging to Darin which is a small town on the coast from where scents are
bought. And "`anajahu" means "turned it". It is said "`anajtun'n-naqata - like nasartu -
a`najuha `anjan". "When you turn the she-camel." And "an-nuti" means sailor.
His words "daffatay jufunihi" means edges of the eyelids, since "ad-daffatan" means the two
edges. His words "wa filadhu'z-zabarjadi": "al-filadh" is the plural of "al-fildhah" it means
piece. His words "ka ba'isi'l-lu'lu'i'r-ratibi". "al-kibasah" means bunch of dates. "al-`asalij"
means twigs. Its singular is "`usluj".
