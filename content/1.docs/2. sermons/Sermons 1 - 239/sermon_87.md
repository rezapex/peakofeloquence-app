About getting ready for the next world and following Allah's
commandments
Allah knows hidden matters and is aware of inner feelings. He encompasses everything. He
has control over everything and power over everything. Everyone of you should do whatever
he has to do during his days of life before the approach of death, in his leisure before his
occupation, and during the breathing of his breath before it is overtaken by suffocation,
should provide for himself and his journey and should collect provision from his place of halt
for his place of stay.
So remember Allah, O' people, about what He has asked you in His Book to take care of, and
about His rights that He has entrusted to you. Verily, Allah has not created you in vain nor
left you unbridled nor left you alone in ignorance and gloom. He has defined what you should
leave behind.
taught you your acts, ordained your death, sent down to you. "the Book (Qur'an) explaining
everything" (Qur'an, 16:89) and made His Prophet live among you for a long time till He
completed for him and for you the message sent through the Qur'an namely the religion liked
by Him, and clarified through him His good acts and evil acts, His prohibitions and His
commands.
He placed before you His arguments and exhausted his excuses upon you. He put forth to you
His promises and warned you of severe retribution. You should therefore make full atonement
during your remaining days and let yourselves practice endurance in these days.
These days are fewer as against the many days during which you have shown obliviousness
and heedlessness towards admonition. Do not allow time to yourselves because it will put you
on the path of wrong-doers and do not be easy-going because this will push you towards
sinfulness.
O' creatures of Allah! the best adviser for himself is he who is the most obedient to Allah, and
the most deceiving for himself is he who is the most disobedient to Allah. Deceived is he who
deceived his own self. Enviable is he whose Faith is safe.
Fortunate is he who takes lesson from others, while unfortunate is he who fell victim to his
desires. You should know that even the smallest hypocrisy is like believing in more than one
God, and keeping company of people who follow their desires is the key to obliviousness
from religion, and is the seat of Satan.
Be on your guard against falsehood because it is contrary to Faith. A truthful person is on the
height of salvation and dignity, while the liar is on the edge of ignominy and degradation. Do
not be jealous because jealousy eats away Faith just as fire eats away dried wood. Do not bear
malice because, it is a scraper (of virtues).
And know that desires make wit forgetful and make memory oblivious. You should falsify
desire because it is a deception, and he who has desires is in deceit.
