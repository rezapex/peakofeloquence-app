He (the believer) kept his mind alive and killed (the desires of) hisheart till his body became

way for him andtook him on the (right) path.
Different doors led him to the door ofsafety and the place of (his permanent) stay. His feet,
balancing hisbody became fixed in the position of safety and comfort, because hekept his
