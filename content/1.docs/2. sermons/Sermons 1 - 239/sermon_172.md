When Amir al-mu'minin decided to fight the enemy face to face at
Siffin he said:
O' my Allah! Sustainer of the high sky and the suspended firmament which Thou hast made a
shelter for the night and the day, an orbit for the sun and the moon and a path for the rotating
stars, and for populating it Thou hast created a group of Thy angels who do not get weary of
worshipping Thee.
O' Sustainer of this earth which Thou hast made an abode for people and a place for the
movement of insects and beasts and countless other creatures seen and unseen. O' Sustainer of
strong mountains which Thou hast made as pegs for the earth and (a means of) support for
people.
If Thou givest us victory over our enemy, save us from excesses and keep us on the straight
path of truth. But if Thou givest them victory over us, then grant us martyrdom and save us
from mischief.
Where are those who protect honour, and those self-respecting persons who defend
respectable persons in the time of hardship? Shame is behind you while Paradise is in front of
you.
