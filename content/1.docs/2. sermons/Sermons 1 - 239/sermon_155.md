title: Sermon 155
description: This is sermon 155

About the Ahlu'l-bayt (of the Holy Prophet) and their opposers
He who has an intelligent mind looks to his goal. He knows his low road as well as his high
road. The caller has called. The shepherd has tended (his flocks). So respond to the caller and
follow the shepherd.
They (the opposers) have entered the oceans of disturbance and have taken to innovations
instead of the Sunnah (the Prophet's holy deeds, utterances and his unspoken approvals),
while the believers have sunk down, and the misguided and the liars are speaking. We are the
near ones, companions, treasure holders and doors (to the Sunnah). Houses are not entered
save through their doors. Whoever enters them from other than the door is called a thief.
A part of the same sermon
The delicacies of the Qur'an are about them (Ahlu'l-bayt, the descendants of the Prophet) and
they are the treasurers of Allah. When they speak they speak the truth, but when they keep
quiet no one can speak unless they speak. The forerunner should report correctly to his
people, should retain his wits and should be one of the children (a man) of the next world,
because he has come from there and would return to it.
The beginning of the action of one who sees with heart and acts with eyes it is to assess
whether the action will go against him or for him. If it is for him he indulges in it, but if it is
against him he keeps away from it. For, he who acts without knowledge is like one who treads
without a path. Then his deviation from the path keeps him at a distance from his aim. And he
who acts according to knowledge is like he who treads the clear path. Therefore, he who can
see should see whether he should proceed or return.
You should also know that the outside (of every thing) has a similar inside. Of whatever the
outside is good, its inside too is good, and whatever the outside is bad, its inside too is bad.
The truthful Prophet (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him and his progeny) has said that:
"Allah may love a man but hate his action, and may love the action but hate the man.
" You should also know that every action is like a vegetation, and a vegetation cannot do
without water while waters are different. So where the water is good the plant is good and its
fruits are sweet, whereas where the water is bad. the plant will also be bad and its fruits will
be bitter.
