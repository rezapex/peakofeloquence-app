When Amir al-mu'minin's men showed
impatience on his delay in giving them permission to fight in Siffin , he said:
Well, as for your idea whether this (delay) is due to my unwillingness for death, then by Allah
I do not care whether I proceed towards death or death advances towards me. As for your
impression that it may be due to my misgivings about the people of Syria (ash-Sham) ,well by
Allah, I did not put off war even for a day except in the hope that some group may join me,
find guidance through me and see my light with their weak eyes.
This is dearer to me than to kill them in the state of their misguidance although they would be
bearing their own sins.
