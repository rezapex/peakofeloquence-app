About those who sit for dispensation of justice among people but are
not fit for it.
Among(1) all the people the most detested before Allah are two persons. One is he who is
devoted to his self. So he is deviated from the true path and loves speaking about (foul)
innovations and inviting towards wrong path. He is therefore a nuisance for those who are
enamoured of him, is himself misled from the guidance of those preceding him, misleads
those who follow him in his life or after his death, carries the weight of others' sins and is
entangled in his own misdeeds.
The other man is he who has picked up ignorance. He moves among the ignorant, is senseless
in the thick of mischief and is blind to the advantages of peace. Those resembling like men
have named him scholar but he is not so. He goes out early morning to collect things whose
deficiency is better than plenty, till when he has quenched his thirst from polluted water and
acquired meaningless things.
He sits among the people as a judge responsible for solving whatever is confusing to the
others. If an ambiguous problem is presented before him he manages shabby argument about
it of his own accord and passes judgement on its basis. In this way he is entangled in the
confusion of doubts as in the spider's web, not knowing whether he was right or wrong. If he
is right he fears lest he erred, while if he is wrong he hopes he is right. He is ignorant,
wandering astray in ignorance and riding on carriages aimlessly moving in darkness. He did
not try to find reality of knowledge. He scatters the traditions as the wind scatters the dry
leaves.
By Allah, he is not capable of solving the problems that come to him nor is fit for the position
assigned to him. Whatever he does not know he does not regard it worth knowing. He does
not realise that what is beyond his reach is within the reach of others. If anything is not clear
to him he keeps quiet over it because he knows his own ignorance. Lost lives are crying
against his unjust verdicts, and properties (that have been wrongly disposed of) are grumbling
against him.
I complain to Allah about persons who live ignorant and die misguided. For them nothing is
more worthless than Qur'an if it is recited as it should be recited, nor anything more valuable
than the Qur'an if its verses are removed from their places, nor anything more vicious than
virtue nor more virtuous than vice.
(1). Amir al-mu'minin has held two categories of persons as the most detestable by Allah and
the worst among people. Firstly, those who are misguided even in basic tenets and are busy in
the spreading of evil. Secondly, those who abandon the Qur'an and sunnah and pronounce
injunctions through their imagination. They create a circle of their devotees and popularise the
religious code of law concocted by themselves.
The misguidance and wrongfulness of such persons does not remain confined to their own
selves but the seed of misguidance sown by them bears fruit and growing into the form of a
big tree provides asylum to the misguided and this misguidance goes on multiplying. And since
these very people are the real originators the weight of other's sins is also on their shoulders
as the Qur'an says:
And certainly they shall bear their own burdens, and (other) burdens with their own burdens...
