Attributes of Allah
Praise be to Allah, Creator of people; He has spread the earth. He makes streams to flow and
vegetation to grow on high lands. His primality has no beginning, nor has His eternity any
end. He is the First and from ever. He is the everlasting without limit.
Foreheads bow before Him and lips declare His oneness. He determined the limits of things at
the time of His creating them, keeping Himself away from any likeness.
Imagination cannot surmise Him within the limits of movements limbs or senses. It cannot be
said about Him: "whence"; and no time limit can be attributed to Him by saying "till". He is
apparent, but it cannot be said "from what".
He is hidden, but it cannot be said "in what". He is not a body which can die, nor is He veiled
so as to be enclosed therein. He is not near to things by way of touch, nor is He remote from
them by way of separation.
The gazing of people's eyes is not hidden from Him, nor the repetition of words, nor the
glimpse of hillocks, nor the tread of a footstep in the dark night or in the deep gloom, where
the shining moon casts its light and the effulgent sun comes in its wake, through its setting
and appearing again and again with the rotation of time and periods, by the approach of the
advancing night or the passing away of the running day.
He precedes every extremity and limit, and every counting and numbering. He is far above
what those whose regard is limited attribute to Him, such as the qualities of measure, having
extremities, living in house and dwelling in abodes, because limits are meant for creation and
are attributable only to other than Allah.
Allah, the Originator from naught
He did not create things from eternal matter nor after ever-existing examples, but He created
whatever He created and then He fixed limits thereto, and He shaped whatever He shaped and
gave the best shape thereto. Nothing can disobey Him, but the obedience of something is of
no benefit to Him.
His knowledge about those who died in the past is the same as His knowledge about the
remaining survivors, and His knowledge about whatever there is in the high skies is like His
knowledge of whatever there is in the low earth.
A part of the same sermon
About man's creation, and pointing towards the requirements of life.
O' creature who has been equitably created and who has been nurtured and looked after in the
darkness of wombs with multiple curtains.
You were originated from the essence of clay (Qur'an, 23:12) and placed in a still place for a
known length (Qur'an, 77:21-22) and an ordained time. You used to move in the womb of
your mother as an embryo, neither responding to a call nor hearing any voice.
Then you were taken out from your place of stay to a place you had not seen, and you were
not acquainted with the means of awaiting its benefits, or with who guided you to eke out
your sustenance from the udder of your mother, and, when your were in need, appraised you
of the location of what you required or aimed at.
Alas! Certainly he who is unable to understand the qualities of a being with shape and limbs
is the more unable to understand the qualities of the Creator and the more remote from
appreciating Him through the limitations of creatures.
