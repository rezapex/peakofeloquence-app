A prayer which Amir al-mu'minin often recited
Praise be to Allah! Who made me such that I have not died nor am I sick, nor have my veins
been infected with disease, nor have I been hauled up for my evil acts, nor am I without
progeny, nor have I forsaken my religion, nor do I disbelieve in my Lord, nor do I feel
strangeness with my faith, nor is my intelligence affected, nor have I been punished with the
punishment of peoples before me.
I am a slave in Thy possession, I have been guilty of excesses over myself. Thou hast
exhausted Thy pleas over me and I have no plea (before Thee).
I have no power to take except what Thou givest me, and I cannot evade except what Thou
savest me from. O' my Allah! I seek Thy protection from becoming destitute despite Thy
riches, from being misguided despite Thy guidance, from being molested in Thy realm and
from being humiliated while authority rests with Thee. O' my Allah! let my spirit be the first
of those good objects that Thou takest from me and the first trust out of Thy favours held in
trust with me.
O' my Allah! we seek Thy protection from turning away from Thy command or revolting
against Thy religion, or being led away by our desires instead of by guidance that comes from
Thee.
