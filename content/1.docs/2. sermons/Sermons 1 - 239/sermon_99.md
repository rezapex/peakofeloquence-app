Oppression of the Umayyads
By Allah, they would continue like this till there would be left no unlawful act before Allah
but they would make it lawful and no pledge but they would break it, and till there would
remain no house of bricks or of woollen tents but their oppression would enter it.
Their bad dealings would make them wretched, till two groups of crying complainants would
rise, one would cry for his religion and the other for this world and the help of one of you to
one of them would be like the help of a slave to his master, namely when he is present he
obeys him, but when the master is away he backbites him.
The highest among you in distress would be he who bear best belief about Allah. If Allah
grants you safety accept it, and if you are put in trouble endure it, because surely (good) result
is for the God-fearing.
