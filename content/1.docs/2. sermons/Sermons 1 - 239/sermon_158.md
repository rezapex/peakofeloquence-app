Urging people towards Piety (taqwa)
Praise be to Allah who made praise the Key for His remembrance, a means for increase of His
bounty and a guide for His Attributes and Dignity.
O' creatures of Allah! Time will deal with the survivors just as it dealt with those gone by.
The time that has passed will not return and whatever there is in it will not stay for ever. Its
later deeds are the same as the former ones. Its trouble try to excel one another. Its banners
follow each other. It is as though you are attached to the last day which is driving you as
rapidly as are driven the she camels which are dry for seven months.
He who busies himself with things other than improvement of his own self becomes
perplexed in darkness and entangled in ruination. His evil spirits immerse him deep in vices
and make his bad actions appear handsome.
Paradise is the end of those who are forward (in good acts) and Hell is the end of those who
commit excesses.
Know O' creatures of Allah! that piety is a strong house of protection while impiety is a weak
house which does not protect its people, and does not give security to him who takes refuge
therein. Know that the sting of sins is cut by piety and the final aim is achieved by conviction
of belief.
O' creatures of Allah! (fear) Allah, (fear) Allah, in the matter of your own selves, which are
the most beloved and dear to you, because Allah has clarified to you the way of truthfulness
and lighted its paths. So (you may choose) either ever-present misfortune or eternal
happiness. You should therefore provide in these mortal days for the eternal days. You have
been informed of the provision, ordered to march and told to make haste in setting off.
You are like staying riders who do not know when they would be ordered to march on.
Beware, what will he, who has been created for the next world, do with this world? What will
a person do with wealth which he would shortly be deprived of while only its ill effects and
reckoning would be left behind for him?
O' creatures of Allah! the good which Allah has promised should not be abandoned and the
evil from which He has refrained should not be coveted. O' creatures of Allah! fear the day
when actions will be reckoned; there will be much quaking and even children will get old.
Know, O' creatures of Allah! that your own self is a guard over you; limbs are watchmen and
truthful vigil-keepers who preserve (the record of) your actions and the numbers of your
breaths. The gloom of the dark night cannot conceal you from them, nor can closed doors
hide you from them. Surely tomorrow is close to today.
Today will depart with all that it has and tomorrow will come in its wake. It is as though
every one of you has reached that place on earth where he would be alone, namely the
location of his grave. So, what to say of the lonely house, the solitary place of staying and the
solitary exile.
It is as though the cry (of the Horn) has reached you, the Hour has overtaken you and you
have come out (of your graves) for the passing of judgement.
(The curtains of) falsehood have been removed from you and your excuses have become
weak. The truth about you has been proved. All your matters have proceeded to their
consequences. Therefore. you should (now) take counsel from examples, learn lessons from
vicissitudes and take advantage of the warners.
