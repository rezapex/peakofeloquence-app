About abstinence of the world and vicissitudes of time
We praise Allah for what has happened and seek His succour in our affairs for what is yet to
happen, and we beg Him for safety in the faith just as we beg Him for safety in our bodies.
O' creatures of Allah! I advise you to keep away from this world which is (shortly) to leave
you even though you do not like its departure, and which would make your bodies old even
though you would like to keep them fresh.
Your example and its example is like the travellers who travel some distance and then as
though they traverse it quickly or they aimed at a sign and reached it at once. How short is the
distance to the aim if one heads towards it and reaches it.
And how short is the stage of one who has only a day which he cannot exceed while a swift
driver is driving him in this world till he departs from it.
So do not hanker after worldly honour and its pride, and do not feel happy over its beauties
and bounties nor wail over its damages and misfortunate because its honour and pride would
end while its beauty and bounty would perish, and its damages and misfortunes would pass
away. Every period in it has an end and every living being in it is to die.
Is not there for you a warning in the relics of the predecessors and an eye opener and lesson in
your fore-fathers, provided you understand?
Do you not see that your predecessors do not come back and the surviving followers do not
remain? Do you not observe that the people of the world pass mornings and evenings in
different conditions? Thus, (somewhere) the dead is wept for, someone is being condoled,
someone is prostrate in distress, someone is enquiring about the sick, someone is passing his
last breath, someone is hankering after the world while death is looking for him, someone is
forgetful but he is not forgotten (by death), and on the footsteps of the predecessors walk the
survivors.
Beware! At the time of committing evil deeds remember the destroyer of joys, the spoiler of
pleasures, and the killer of desires (namely death). Seek assistance of Allah for fulfilment of
His obligatory rights, and for (thanking Him) for His countless bounties and obligations.
