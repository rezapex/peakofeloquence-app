description: This is sermon 105

About the condition of the people before the proclamation of prophethood and the
Prophet's performance in spreading his message
So now, certainly Allah deputised Muhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.p.) as the Prophet while no one
among the Arabs read the Book nor claimed prophethood or revelation. He had to fight those
who disobeyed him in company with those who followed him, leading them towards their
salvation and hastening with them lest death overtook them.
When any weary person sighed or a distressed one stopped he stood at him till he got him his
aim, except the worst in whom there was not virtue at all. Eventually he showed them their
goal and carried them to their places (of deliverance).
Consequently, their affairs moved on and their hand-mill began to rotate (i.e. position gained
strength), their spears got straightened.
By Allah, I was among their rear-guard till they turned back on their sides and were flocked
in their rope. I never showed weakness or lack of courage, nor did I betray or become languid.
By Allah, I shall split the wrong till I extract right from its flanks.
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: I have quoted a selected part of this sermon before, but since I have
found in the narration that this part differs from the previous one, more or less, I deemed it
necessary to quote it again here.
