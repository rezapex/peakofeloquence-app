When the Consultative Committee (or Shura) decided to swear
allegiance to `Uthman, Amir al-mu'minin said:
You have certainly known that I am the most rightful of all others for the Caliphate. By Allah,
so long as the affairs of Muslims remain intact and there is no oppression in it save on myself
I shall keep quiet seeking reward for it (from Allah) and keeping aloof from its attractions and
allurements for which you aspire.
