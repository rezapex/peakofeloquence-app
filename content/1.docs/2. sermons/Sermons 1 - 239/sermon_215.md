The Prophet's nobility of descent
I stand witness that He is just and does justice, He is the arbiter Who decides (between right
and wrong). I also stand witness that Muhammad is His slave. His Messenger and the Chief
of His creatures. Whenever Allah divided the line of descent, He put him in the better one,
and therefore, no evil-doer ever shared with him nor was any vicious person his partner.
Beware! surely Allah, the Glorified, has provided for virtue those who are suited to it, for
truth pillars (that support it), and for obedience protection (against deviation). In every matter
of obedience you will find Allah, the Glorified's succour that will speak through tongues and
accord firmness to hearts. It has sufficiency for those who seek sufficiency, and a cure for
those who seek cure.
The characteristics of the virtuous whose guidance must be followed
Know that, certainly, those creatures of Allah who preserve His knowledge offer protection to
those things which He desires to be protected and make His springs flow (for the benefit of
others). They contact each other with friendliness and meet each other with affection. They
drink water from cups that quench the thirst and return from the watering places fully satiated.
Misgiving does not affect them and backbiting does not gain ground with them.
In this way Allah has tied their nature with good manners. Because of this they love each
other and meet each other. They have become superior, like seeds which are selected by
taking some and throwing away others. This selection has distinguished them and the process
of choosing has purified them.
Therefore, man should secure honour by adopting these qualities. He should fear the day of
Doom before it arrives, and he should appreciate the shortness of his life and the shortness of
his sojourn in the place of stay which has only to last for his change over to the next place.
He should therefore do something for his change over and for the known stages of his
departure. Blessed be he who possesses a virtuous heart, who obeys one who guides him,
desists from him who takes to ruin, catches the path of safety with the help of him who
provides him light (of guidance) and by obeying the leader who commands him, hastens
towards guidance before its doors are closed, gets open the door of repentance and removes
the (stain of) sins.
He has certainly been put on the right path and guided towards the straight road.
