Admonishing his own companions
Although Allah gives time to the oppressor, His catch would not spare him. Allah watches
him on the passage of his way and the position of that which suffocates the throats.
By Allah in Whose power my life lies, these people (Mu`awiyah and his men) will overcome
you not because they have a better right than you but because of their hastening towards the
wrong with their leader and your slowness about my right (to be followed). People are afraid
of the oppression of their rulers while I fear the oppression of my subjects.
I called you for war but you did not come. I warned you but you did not listen. I called you
secretly as well as openly, but you did not respond. I gave you sincere counsel, but you did
not accept it. Are you present like the absent, and slaves like masters? I recite before you
points of wisdom but you turn away from them, and I advise you with far reaching advice but
you disperse away from it.
I rouse you for jihad against the people of revolt but before I come to the end of my speech, I
see you disperse like the sons of Saba.(2) You return to your places and deceive one another
by your counsel. I straighten you in the morning but you are back to me in the evening as
curved as the back of a bow. The sraightener has become weary while those to be straightened
have become incorrigible.
O' those whose bodies are present but wits are absent, and whose wishes are scattered. Their
rulers are on trial. Your leader obeys Allah but you disobeyed him while the leader of the
people of Syria (ash-Sham) disobeys Allah but they obey him. By Allah, I wish Mu`awiyah
exchanges with me like Dinars with Dirhams, so that he takes from me ten of you and gives
me one from them.
O' people of Kufah, I have experienced in you three things and two others: you are deaf in
spite of having ears, dumb in spite of speaking, and blind in spite of having eyes. You are
neither true supporters in combat nor dependable brothers in distress. Your hands may be
soiled with earth. O' examples of those camels whose herdsman has disappeared, if they are
collected together from one side they disperse from the other.
By Allah, I see you in my imagination that if war becomes intense and action is in full swing
you would run away from the son of Abi Talib like the woman who becomes naked in the
front. I am certainly on clear guidance from my Lord (Allah) and on the path of my Prophet
and I am on the right path which I adhere to regularly.
About the Household of the Holy Prophet
Look at the people of the Prophet's family. Adhere to their direction. Follow their footsteps
because they would never let you out of guidance, and never throw you into destruction. If
they sit down, you sit down, and if they rise up you rise up. Do not go ahead of them, as you
would thereby go astray and go not lag behind of them as you would thereby be ruined.
I have seen the companions of the Prophet but I do not find anyone resembling them. They
began the day with dust on the hair and face (in hardship of life) and passed the night in
prostration and standing in prayers. Sometimes they put down their foreheads and sometimes
their cheeks. With the recollection of their resurrection it seemed as though they stood on live
coal.
It seemed that in between their eyes there were signs like knees of goats, resulting from long
prostrations. When Allah was mentioned their eyes flowed freely till their shirt collars were
drenched. They trembled for fear of punishment and hope of reward as the tree trembles on
the day of stormy wind.
(1). In the atmosphere that had been created soon after the Prophet the Ahlu'l-bayt (members
of his family) had no course except to remain secluded as a result of which world has remained
ignorant of their real qualities and unacquainted with their teachings and attainments, and to
belittle them and keeping them away from authority has been considered as the greatest
service to Islam.
If `Uthman's open misdeeds had not given a chance to the Muslims to wake up and open their
eyes there would have been no question of allegiance to Amir al-mu'minin and temporal
authority would have retained the same course as it had so far followed. But all those who
could be named for the purpose had no courage to come forward because of their own
shortcomings while Mu`awiyah was sitting in his capital away from the centre.
In these circumstances there was none except Amir al-mu'minin who could be looked at.
Consequently people's eyes hovered around him and the same common people who, following
the direction of the wind, had been swearing allegiance to others jumped at him for swearing
allegiance. Nevertheless, this allegiance was not on the count that they regarded his Caliphate
as from Allah and him as an Imam (Divine Leader) to obey whom was obligatory. It was rather
under their own principles which were known as democratic or consultative.
However, there was one group who was swearing allegiance to him as a religious obligation
regarding his Caliphate as determined by Allah. Otherwise, the majority regarded him a ruler
like the other Caliphs, and as regards precedence, on the fourth position, or at the level of the
common men after the three caliphs.
Since the people, the army, and the civil servants had been impressed by the beliefs and
actions of the previous rulers and immersed in their ways whenever they found anything
against their liking they fretted and frowned, evaded war and were ready to rise in
disobedience and revolt.
Further, just as among those who fought in jihad with the Prophet there were some seekers of
this world and others of the next world, in the same way here too there was no dearth of
worldly men who were, in appearance, with Amir al-mu'minin but actually they had
connections with Mu`awiyah who has promised some of them positions and had extended to
others temptation of wealth.
To hold them as Shi`ahs of Amir al-mu'minin and to blame Shi`ism for this reason is closing
the eyes to facts, because the beliefs of these people would be the same as of those who
regarded Amir al-mu'minin fourth in the series. Ibn Abi'l-Hadid throws light on the beliefs of
these persons in clear words:
Whoever observes minutely the events during the period of Caliphate of Amir almu'minin
would know that Amir al-mu'minin had been brought to bay because
those who knew his real position were very few, and the swarming majority did
not bear that belief about him which was obligatory to have.
They gave precedence to the previous Caliphs over him and held that the
criterion of precedence was Caliphate, and in this matter those coming later
followed the predecessors, and argued that if the predecessors had not the
knowledge that the previous Caliphs had precedence over Amir al-mu'minin they
would not have preferred them to him.
Rather, these people knew and took Amir al-mu'minin as a citizen and subject.
Most of those who fought in his company did so on grounds of prestige or Arab
partisanship, not on the ground of religion or belief. (Sharh Nahj al-balaghah,
vol.7, p.72)
(2). The progeny of Saba' ibn Yashjub ibn Ya`rub ibn Qahtan is known as the tribe of Saba'.
When these people began to falsify prophets then to shake them Allah sent to them a flood of
water by which their gardens were submerged and they left their houses and property to settle
down in different cities.
This proverb arose out of this event and it is now applied wherever people so disperse that
there can be no hope of their joining together again.
