title: Sermon 54
description: This is sermon 54
---

(This sermon has already appeared
earlier but due to the difference between the two versions we have quoted it again here). Its
subject is the downfall of the world and reward and punishment in the next world.
Beware, the world is wrapping itself up and has announced its departure. Its known things
have become strangers and it is speedily moving backward.
It is advancing its inhabitants towards destruction and driving its neighbours towards death.
Its sweet things (enjoyments) have become sour, and its clear things have become polluted.
Consequently, what has remained of it is just like the remaining water in a vessel or a
mouthful of water in the measure.
If a thirsty person drinks it his thirst is not quenched.
O' creatures of Allah get ready to go out of this world for whose inhabitants decay is
ordained, and (beware) heart's wishes should overpower you, nor should you take your stay
(in life) to be long. By Allah, if you cry like the she-camel that has lost its young one, call out
like the cooing of pigeons, make noise like devoted recluses and turn to Allah leaving your
wealth and children as a means to secure His nearness and high position with Him or the
forgiveness of sins which have been covered by His books and recorded by His angels it
would be less than His reward that I expect for you or His retribution that I fear about you.
By Allah, if your hearts melt down thoroughly and your eyes shed tears of blood either in
hope for Him or for fear from Him and you are also allowed to live in this world all the time
that it lasts even then your actions cannot pay for His great bounties over you and His having
guided you towards faith.
A part of the same sermon on the description of the Day of Sacrifice (`Id al-Adha) and the
qualities of the animal for sacrifice
For an animal to be fully fit for sacrifice it is necessary that both its ears should be raised
upwards and its eyes should be healthy. If the ears and the eyes are sound the animal of
sacrifice is sound and perfect, even though its horn be broken or it drags its feet to the place
of sacrifice.
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: Here place of sacrifice means place of slaughter.
