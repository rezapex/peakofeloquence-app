In disparagement of those who shrink from fighting
I am faced with men who do not obey when I order and do not respond when I call them. May
you have no father! (Woe to you!) What are you waiting for to rise for the cause of Allah?
Does not faith join you together, or sense of shame rouse you? I stand among you shouting
and I am calling you for help, but you do not listen to my word, and do not obey my orders,
till circumstances show out their bad consequences.
No blood can be avenged through you and no purpose can be achieved with you. I called you
for help of your brethren but made noises like the camel having pain in stomach, and became
loose like the camel of thin back. Then a wavering weak contingent came to me from amongst
you: "as if they are being led to death and they are only watching." (1) (Qur'an, 8:6)
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: Amir al-mu'minin's word "mutadha'ib" means "mudtarib" (i.e. moved
or troubled), as they say "tadha'abat ar-rih" (i.e. the winds blow in troubled manner).
Similarly the wolf is called "dhi'b" because of its troubled movement.
(1). Mu`awiyah sent a contingent of two thousand soldiers under an-Nu`man ibn Bashir to
assault `Aynu't-Tamr. This place was a defence base of Amir al-mu'minin near Kufah whose
incharge was Malik ibn Ka`b al-Arhabi. Although there were a thousand combatants under him,
but at the moment only hundred men were present there. When Malik noticed the offensive
force advancing he wrote to Amir al-mu'minin for help.
When Amir al-mu'minin received the message he asked the people for his help but only three
hundred men got ready as a result of which Amir al-mu'minin was much disgusted and
delivered this sermon in their admonition.
When Amir al-mu'minin reached his house after delivering the sermon `Adi ibn Hatim at-Ta'i
came and said, "O' Amir al-mu'minin a thousand men of Banu Tayyi' are under me. If you say I
shall send them off." Amir al-mu'minin said, "It does not look nice that people of one tribe only
should meet the enemy. You prepare your force in the Valley of an-Nukhaylah.
" Accordingly he went there and called people to jihad, when besides Banu Tayyi' one thousand
other combatants also assembled. They were still preparing to set off when word reached from
Malik ibn Ka`b that there was no need for help as he had repulsed the enemy.
The reason of this was that Malik had sent off `Abdullah ibn Hawalah al-Azdi hastily to Qarazah
ibn Ka`b al-Ansari and Mikhnaf ibn Sulaym al-Azdi so that if there was delay in the arrival of
support from Kufah he could get help from here in time.
`Abdullah went to both, but got no help from Qarazah. However, Mikhnaf ibn Sulaym got
ready fifty persons under `Abd ar-Rahman ibn Mikhnaf and they reached there near evening.
Upto that time the two thousand men (of the enemy) had not been able to subdue the
hundred men of Malik.
When an-Nu`man saw these fifty men he thought that their forces had started coming in so he
fled away from the battlefield. Even in their retreat Malik attacked them from rear and killed
three of their men.
