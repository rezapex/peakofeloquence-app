Before his passing away (last will)
O' people. Every one has to meet what he wishes to avoid by running away. (1) Death is the
place to which life is driving. To run away from it means to catch it. How many days did I
spend in searching for the secret of this matter, but Allah did not allow save its concealment.
Alas! It is a treasured knowledge.
As for my last will, it is that concerning Allah, do not believe in a partner for Him, and
concerning Muhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.p.), do not disregard his Sunnah. Keep these two pillars
and burn these two lamps. Till you are not divided, no evil will come to you. (2) Every one of
you has to bear his own burden. It has been kept light for the ignorant. Allah is Merciful.
Faith is straight. The leader (Prophet) is the holder of knowledge. Yesterday I was with you;
today I have become the object of a lesson for you, and tomorrow I shall leave you. Allah
may forgive me and you.
If the foot remains firm in this slippery place, well and good. But if the foot slips, this is
because we are under the shade of branches, the passing of the winds and the canopy of the
clouds whose layers are dispersed in the sky, and whose traces disappeared (3) in the earth. I
was your neighbour.
My body kept you company for some days and shortly you will find just an empty body of
mine which would be stationary after (all its) movement and silent after speech so that my
calmness, the closing of my eyes, and the stillness of my limbs may provide you counsel,
because it is more of a counsel for those who take a lesson (from it) than eloquent speech and
a ready word.
I am departing from you like one who is eager to meet (someone). Tomorrow you will look at
my days, then my inner side will be disclosed to you and you will understand me after the
vacation of my place and its occupation by someone else.
(1). This means that during all the time spent in the attempts that a man makes to avoid
death and in the means he adopts for it, it is only the span of life that is shortened. As the time
passes the objective of death approaches near, so much so that in one's attempt to seek life
one meets death. (2). "wa khalakum dhammun" (No evil will come to you). This sentence is
used as a proverb. It was first employed by Qasir, slave of Jadhimah ibn Malik al-Abrash.
(3). The intention is that when all these things die, how can those who inhabit them remain
safe? Certainly they too, like every thing else, have to pass away some day or other. Then why
should there be any wonder at my life coming to an end?
