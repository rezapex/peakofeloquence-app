One of the Kharijites al-Burj ibn Mus'hir at-Ta'i raised the slogan, "Command behoves only
Allah" in such a way that Amir al-mu'minin heard it. On hearing it he said:
Keep quite, may Allah make you ugly, O' you with broken tooth. Certainly, by Allah, when
truth became manifest even then your personality was weak and your voice was lose. But
when wrong began to shout loudly you again sprouted up like the horns of a kid.
