Amir al-mu'minin recited the verse
Engage (your) vying in exuberance, until ye come to the graves. (1) (Qur'an,
102:1-2)
Then he said:
How distant (from achievement) is their aim, how neglectful are these visitors and how
difficult is the affair. They have not taken lessons from things which are full of lessons, but
they took them from far off places. Do they boast on the dead bodies of their fore-fathers, or
do they regard the number of dead persons as a ground for feeling boastful of their number?
They want to revive the bodies that have become spiritless and the movements that have
ceased.
They are more entitled to be a source of lesson than a source of pride. They are more suitable
for being a source of humility than of honour.
They looked at them with weak-sighted eyes and descended into the hollow of ignorance. If
they had asked about them from the dilapidated houses and empty courtyards, they would
have said that they went into the earth in the state of misguidance and you too are heading
ignorantly towards them.
You trample their skulls, want to raise constructions on their corpses, you graze what they
have left and live in houses which they have vacated. The days (that lie) between them and
you are also bemoaning you and reciting elegies over you.
They are your fore-runners in reaching the goal and have arrived at the watering places before
you. They had positions of honour and plenty of pride. They were rulers and holders of
positions. Now they have gone into the interstice where earth covers them from above and is
eating their flesh and drinking their blood. They lie in the hollows of their graves lifeless, no
more growing, and hidden, not to be found.
The approach of dangers does not frighten them, and the adversity of circumstances does not
grieve them. They do not mind earthquakes, nor do they pay heed to thunders. They are gone
and not expected back. They are existent but unseen. They were united but are now dispersed.
They were friendly and are now separated.
Their accounts are unknown and their houses are silent, not because of length of time or
distance of place, but because they have been made to drink the cup (of death) which has
changed their speech into dumbness, their hearing into deafness and their movements into
stillness.
It seems as though they are fallen in slumber. They are neighbours not feeling affection for
each other, or friends who do not meet each other. The bonds of their knowing each other
have been worn out and the connections of their friendship have been cut asunder. Everyone
of them is therefore alone although they are a group, and they are strangers, even though
friends. They are unaware of morning after a night and of evening after a day.
The night or the day when they departed has become ever existent for them. (2) They found
the dangers of their placed of stay more serious than they had apprehended, and they
witnessed that its signs were greater than they had guessed. The two objectives (namely
paradise and hell) have been stretched for them upto a point beyond the reach of fear or hope.
Had they been able to speak they would have become dumb to describe what they witnessed
or saw.
Even though their traces have been wiped out and their news has stopped (circulating), eyes
are capable of drawing a lesson, as they looked at them, ears of intelligence heard them and
they spoke without uttering words. So, they said that handsome faces have been destroyed
and delicate bodies have been smeared with earth. We have put on a worn-out shroud.
The narrowness of the grave has overwhelmed us and strangeness has spread among us. Our
silent abodes have been ruined. The beauty of our bodies has disappeared. Our known
features have become hateful. Our stay in the places of strangeness has become long. We do
not get relief from pain, nor widening from narrowness.
Now. if you portray them in your mind, or if the curtains concealing them are removed from
them for you, in this state when their ears have lost their power and turned deaf, their eyes
have been filled with dust and sunk down, their tongues which were very active have been cut
into pieces, their hearts which were ever wakeful have become motionless in their chests, in
every limb of theirs a peculiar decay has occurred which has deformed it, and has paved the
way for calamity towards it, all these lie powerless, with no hand to help them and no heart to
grieve over them, (then) you would certainly notice the grief of (their) hearts and the dirt of
(their) eyes.
Every trouble of theirs is such that its position does not change and the distress does not clear
away. How many a prestigious body and amazing beauty the earth has swallowed, although
when in the world he enjoyed abundant pleasures and was nurtured in honour. He clung to
enjoyments (even) in the hour of grief. If distress befell him he sought refuge in consolation
(derived) through the pleasures of life and playing and games.
He was laughing at the world while the world was laughing at him because of his life full of
forgetfulness. Then time trampled him like thorns, the days weakened his energy and death
began to look at him from near. Then he was overtaken by a grief which he had never felt,
and ailments appeared in place of the health he had previously possessed.
He then turned to that with which the physician had made him familiar, namely suppressing
the hot (diseases) with cold (medicines) and curing the cold with hot doses, but the cold
things did nothing save aggravate the hot ailments, while the hot ones did nothing except
increasing the coldness, nor did he acquire temperateness in his constitution but rather every
ailment of his increased till his physicians became helpless, his attendants grew loathsome
and his own people felt disgusted from describing his disease, avoided answering those who
enquired about him and quarrelled in front of him about the serious news which they were
concealing from him.
Thus, someone would say "his condition is what it is" and would console them with hopes of
his recovery, while another one would advocate patience on missing him, recalling to them
the calamities that had befallen the earlier generations. In this state when he was getting ready
to depart from the world and leave his beloved ones, such a serious choking overtook him that
his senses became bewildered and the dampness of his tongue dried up.
Now, there was many an important question whose reply he knew about he could not utter it,
and many a voice that was painful for his heart that he heard but remained (unmoved) as
though he was deaf the voice of either and elder whom he used to respect or of a younger
whom he used to caress. The pangs of death are too hideous to be covered by description or to
be appreciated by the hearts of the people in this world.
(1). The genesis of the descending of this verse is that the tribes of Banu `Abd Manaf and
Banu Sahm began to boast against each other over the abundance of their wealth and the
number of their tribesmen, and in order to prove they had a greater number each one began
to include their dead as well, whereupon this verse was revealed to the effect that abundance
of riches and majority in numbers has made you so forgetful that you count the dead also with
the living.
This verse is also taken to mean that abundance of riches and progeny has made you forgetful
till you reached the graves, but the utterance of Amir al-mu'minin supports the first meaning.
(2). This means that for him he who dies in the day it is always day whereas for him who dies
in the night the darkness of night never dispels, because they are at a place where there is no
turning of the moon and the sun and no rotation of the nights and the days. The same
meaning has been expressed by a poet like this:
There is sure to be a day without a night,
Or a night that would come without a day.
