In description of hypocrites
We praise Allah for the succour He has given us in carrying out His obedience and in
preventing us from disobedience, and we ask Him to complete His favours (to us) and to
make us hold on to His rope. We stand witness that Muhammad is His slave and His
Messenger.
He entered every hardship in search of Allah's pleasure and endured for its sake every grief.
His near relations changed themselves for him and those who were remote from him (in
relationship) united against him. The Arabs let loose the reins (of their horses to quicken their
march) against him, and struck the bellies of their carriers to (rouse them) in fighting against
him, so much so that enemies came to his threshold from the remotest places and most distant
areas.
I advise you, O' creatures of Allah, to fear Allah and I warn you of the hypocrites, because
they are themselves misguided and misguide others, and they have slipped and make others
slip too. They change into many colours, and adopt various ways. They support you with all
sorts of supports, and lay in waiting for you at every lookout.
Their hearts are diseased while their faces are clean. They walk stealthily and tread like the
approach of sickness (over the body). Their words speak of cure, but their acts are like
incurable diseases. They are jealous of ease, intensify distress, and destroy hopes.
Their victims are found lying down on every path, while they have means to approach every
heart and they have (false) tears for every grief.
They eulogise each other and expect reward from each other. When they ask something they
insist on it, if they reprove (any one) they disgrace (him), and if they pass verdict they commit
excess. They have adopted for every truth a wrong way, for every erect thing a bender, for
every living being a killer, for every (closed) door a key and for every night a lamp. They
covet, but with despair, in order to maintain with it their markets, and to popularise their
handsome merchandise.
When they speak they create doubts. When they describe they exaggerate. First they offer
easy paths but (afterwards) they make them narrow. In short, they are the party of Satan and
the stings of fire.
Satan hath gained hold on them, so he maketh them forget the remembrance of
Allah; they are Satan's Party; Beware! verily, the party of Satan are the losers.
(Qur'an, 58:19)
