description: This is sermon 86

About the perfection of Allah and counselling
I stand witness that there is no god but Allah, He is One and there is no partner with Him. He
is the First, such that nothing was before Him.
He is the Last, such that there is not limit for Him. Imagination cannot catch any of His
qualities. Hearts cannot entertain belief about His nature. Analysis and division cannot be
applied to Him. Eyes and hearts cannot compare Him.
A part of the same sermon
O' creatures of Allah! take lesson from useful items of instruction and shining indications. Be
cautioned by effective items of warning. Get benefit from preaching and admonition.
It is as though the claws of death are pressed in you, the connection of hope and desires has
been cut asunder, hard affairs have befallen you and your march is towards the place where
everyone has to go, namely death.
Hence, "with every person there is a driver and a witness" (Qur'an, 50:21). The driver drives
him towards resurrection while the witness furnishes evidence about his deeds.
A part of the same sermon (about Paradise)
In Paradise there are high classes and different places of stay. Its boundary never ends. He
who stays in it will never depart from it. He who is endowed with everlasting abode in it will
not get old, and its resident will not face want.
