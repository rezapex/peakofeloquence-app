About Important happenings in Basrah an army which has neither
dust nor noise, nor rustling of reins, nor neighing of horses.
They are trampling the ground with their fe
O' Ahnaf! It is as though I see him advancing with
et as if they are the feet of ostriches.
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: Amir al-mu'minin pointed to the Chief of the Negroes, (Sahibu'z-
Zanj) .(1)
Then Amir al -mu'minin said:
Woe to you (the people of Basrah's) inhabited streets and decorated houses which possess
wings like the wings of vultures and trunks like the trunks of elephants; they are the people
from among whom if one is killed he is not mourned and if one is lost he is not searched for.
I turn this world over on its face, value it only according to its (low) value, and look at it with
an eye suitable to it.
A part of the same sermon
Referring to the Turks (Mongols)
I (2) can see a people whose faces are like shields covered with rough-scraped skins. They
dress themselves in silken and woollen clothes and hold dear excellent horses. Their killing
and bloodshed shall take place freely till the wounded shall walk over the dead and the
number of runners-away shall be less than those taken prisoner:
One of his companions said to him: O' Amir al-mu'minin, you have been given knowledge of
hidden things. Whereupon Amir al-mu'minin laughed and said to the man who belonged to
the tribe of Banu Kalb:
O' brother of Kalb! This is not knowledge of hidden things (`ilmu'l-ghayb), (3) these matters
have been acquired from him (namely in Prophet) who knew them. As regard knowledge of
hidden things, that means knowledge of the Day of Judgement, and the things covered by
Allah in the verse.
Verily, Allah is He with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour... (Qur'an, 31:34)
Therefore, Allah alone knows what is there in the wombs, whether male or female, ugly or
handsome, generous or miserly, mischievous or pious, and who will be the fuel for Hell and
who will be in the company of the Prophets in Paradise.
This is the knowledge of the hidden things which is not known to anyone save Allah. All else
is that whose knowledge Allah passed on to His Prophet and he passed it on to me, and
prayed for me that my bosom may retain it and my ribs may hold it.
(1). `Ali ibn Muhammad was born in the village of Warzanin in the suburbs of Ray and
belonged to the Azariqah sect of the Kharijites. He claimed to be a sayyid (descendant of the
Holy Prophet) by showing himself the son of Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Mukhtafi ibn `Isa ibn
Zayd ibn `Ali ibn al-Husayn ibn `Ali ibn Abi Talib, but the experts on lineality and biographers
have not accepted his claim to being a sayyid and have given his father's name as Muhammad
ibn `Abd ar-Rahim instead of Muhammad ibn Ahmad. The former was from the tribe of `Abd
al-Qays and had been born of a Sindi maid-slave.
`Ali ibn Muhammad rose as an insurgent in 255 A.H. in the reign of al-Muhtadi Billah and
associated with him the people from the suburbs of Basrah on promise of money, wealth and
freedom.
He entered Basrah on the 17th Shuwwal, 255 A.H. killing and looting, and in only two days he
put to death thirty thousand individuals, men, women and children, and displayed extreme
oppression, bloodshed, savageness and ferocity.
He dismantled houses, burnt mosques, and after continuous killing and devastation for
fourteen years, was killed in the month of Safar, 270 A.H. in the reign of Muwaffaq Billah. Then
people got rid of his devastating deeds.
Amir al-mu'minin's prophecy is one of those prophecies which throw light on his knowledge of
the unknown. The details of his army given by Amir al-mu'minin namely that there would be
neither neighing of horses nor rustling of weapons therein is a historical fact.
The historian at-Tabari has written that when this man reached near al-Karkh (a sector of
Baghdad) with the intention of insurrection, the people of that place welcomed him, and a man
presented him a horse for which no rein could be found despite a search. At last he rode it
using a rope for the rein. Similarly there were at that time only three swords in his force - one
with himself, one with `Ali ibn Aban al-Muhallabi, and one with Muhammad ibn Salm, but later
they collected some more weapons by marauding.
(2). This prophecy of Amir al-mu'minin is about the attack of the Tartars (Mongols) who were
inhabitants of the Mongolian desert in the north west of Turkistan. These semi-savage tribes
lived by marauding, killing and devastating. They used to fight among themselves and attack
neighbouring areas. Each tribe had a separate chief who was deemed responsible for their
protection.
Chingiz Khan (Temujin) who was one of the ruling chiefs of these tribes and was very brave
and courageous had risen to organise all their divided tribes into one, and, despite their
opposition he succeeded in overpowering them through his might and sagacity. Collecting a
large number under his banner he rose in 606 A.H. like a torrent and went on dominating cities
and ruining populations till he conquered the area upto North China.
When his authority was established he offered his terms of settlement to `Alau'd-Din
Khwarazm Shah, ruler of the neighbouring country of Turkistan, and through a deputation
concluded an agreement with him that the Tartar traders would be allowed to visit his country
for trade and their life and property would not be subject to any harm.
For some time they traded freely without fear but on one occasion `Alau'd-Din accused them
of spying, seized their goods and had them killed by the Chief of Atrar. When Chingiz Khan
learnt of the breach of the agreement and the killing of Tartar merchants his eyes cast forth
flames and he began trembling with rage.
He sent word to `Alau'd-Din to return the goods of the Tartar merchants and to hand over to
him the ruler of Atrar. `Alau'd-Din, who was mad with power and authority, did not pay any
heed, and acting short-sightedly killed even the plenipotentiary of Chingiz Khan. Now Chingiz
Khan lost all patience and his eyes filled with blood. He rose with his sword in hand, and the
Tartar warriors leapt towards Bukhara on their speedy stallions.
`Alau'd-Din came out with four hundred thousand combatants to face him but could not resist
the incessant assaults of the Tartars, and having been vanquished only after a few attacks ran
away to Nishabur across the river Jaxartes (Sihun).
The Tartars smashed Bukhara and razed it to the ground. They pulled down schools and
mosques, burning to ashes the houses and killing men and women without distinction. Next
year they assaulted Samarqand and devastated it completely. After the flight of `Alau'd-Din,
his son Jalalu'd-Din Khwarazm Shah had assumed the reins of government The Tartars chased
him also, and for ten years he fled from one place to the other but did not fall in their hands.
At last he crossed over the river out of the boundaries of his realm.
During this time the Tartars did their utmost to ruin populated lands and to annihilate
humanity. No city escaped their ruining and no populace could avoid their trampling. Wherever
they went they upset the kingdom, overthrew governments, and in a short time established
their authority over the northern portion of Asia.
When Chingiz Khan died in 622 A.H. his own son Ogedei Khan succeeded him. He searched out
Jalalu'd-Din in 628 A.H. and killed him. After him Mongka Khan, the son of the other son of
Chingiz Khan, occupied the throne. After Mongka Khan, Qubilai Khan succeeded to a part of
the country and the control of Asia fell to the share of his brother Hulagu Khan.
On the division of the whole realm among the grandsons of Chingiz Khan, Hulagu Khan was
thinking of conquering Muslims areas when the Hanafite of Khurasan in enmity with the
Shafi`ite invited him to attack Khurasan. He therefore led an assault on Khurasan, and the
Hanafite, thinking themselves to be safe from the Tartars, opened the city gates for them. But
the Tartars did not make any distinction between Hanafite and Shafi`ite and killed whoever fell
to their hands. After killing most of its population they took it in occupation. These very
differences between the Hanafite and the Shafi`ite opened for him the door of conquest upto
Iraq. Consequently, after conquering Khurasan his courage increased and in 656 A.H. he
marched on Baghdad with two hundred thousand Tartars.
al-Musta`sim Billah's army and the people of Baghdad jointly faced them, but it was not in
their power to stop this torrent of calamity. The result was that the Tartars entered Baghdad
on the day of `Ashura' carrying with them bloodshed and ruin. They remained busy in killing
for forty days. Rivers of blood flowed in the streets and all the alleys were filled with dead
bodies. Hundred of thousands of people were put to the sword while al-Musta`sim Billah was
trampled to death under foot.
Only those people who hid themselves in wells or underground places and hid from their sight
could survive. This was the devastation of Baghdad which shook the `Abbasid Kingdom to its
foundation, so that its flag could never fly thereafter.
Some historians have laid the blame of this ruin on Ibn al-`Alqami (Abu Talib, Muhammad ibn
Ahmad al-Baghdadi), the minister of al-Musta`sim Billah, by holding that, moved by the
general masses of the Shi`ahs and the ruin of al-Karkh sector (of Baghdad), he invited Hulagu
Khan through the latter's minister, the great scholar Nasiru'd-Din Muhammad ibn Muhammad
at-Tusi, to march on Baghdad. Even if it be so, it is not possible to ignore the historical fact
that before this the `Abbasid Caliph an-Nasir Lidini'llah had initiated the move for the attack on
the Muslim areas.
When the Khwarazm Shahs declined to acknowledge the authority of the Caliphate he had sent
word to Chingiz Khan to march on Khwarazm, from which the Tartars had understood that
there was no unity and co-operation among the Muslims.
Thereafter the Hanafite had sent for Hulagu Khan to crush the Shafi`ite as a consequence of
which the Tartars secured control over Khurasan, and prepared the way to march towards
Baghdad. In these circumstances to hold only Ibn al-`Alqami responsible for the ruination of
Baghdad and to ignore the move of an-Nasir Lidini'llah and the dispute between the Hanafite
and the Shafi`ite would be covering up the facts, when in fact the cause for the ruin of
Baghdad was this very conquest of Khurasan, whose real movers were the Hanafite inhabitants
of the place.
It was by this conquest that Hulagu Khan had the courage to march on the centre of Islam;
otherwise it cannot have been the result of a single individual's message that he assaulted an
old capital like Baghdad, the awe of whose power and grandeur was seated in the hearts of a
large part of the world.
(3). To know hidden things on a personal level is one thing, while to be gifted by Allah with
knowledge of any matter and to convey it to others is different. The knowledge of the future
which the prophets and vicegerents possess is gained by them through Allah's teaching and
informing. Allah alone has knowledge of events which are to happen in the future. Of course,
He passes this knowledge on to whoever He wills. Thus He says:
(He alone is) the "Knower of the unseen, neither doth He reveal His secrets unto
any (one else) save unto that one of the Messengers whom He
chooseth..." (Qur'an, 72:26-27)
In this way Amir al-mu'minin also received knowledge of the future through the instructions of
the Prophet or inspiration from Allah, for which these words of Amir al-mu'minin stand
evidence. Of course, sometimes it is not proper or expedient to disclose certain matters and
they are allowed to remain under a veil. Then no one can be acquainted with them as Allah
says:
Verily, Allah is He with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour and He sendeth
down the rain, and knoweth He what is in the wombs; and knoweth not any soul
what he shall earn the morrow, and knoweth not any soul in what lands he shall
die: Verily Allah is All-knowing, All- aware. (Qur'an, 31:34)
