About Islam
The best means by which seekers of nearness to Allah, the Glorified, the Exalted, seek
nearness, is the belief in Him and His Prophet, fighting in His cause, for it is the high pinnacle
of Islam, and (to believe) in the kalimatu'l-'ikhlas (the expression of Divine purification) for it
is just nature and the establishment of prayer for it is (the basis of) community, payment of
zakat (Islamic tax) for it is a compulsory obligation, fasting for the month of Ramadan for it is
the shield against chastisement, the performance of hajj of the House of Allah (i. e . Ka`bah)
and its `umrah (other than annual visit) for these two acts banish poverty and wash away sins,
regard for kinship for it increases wealth and length of life, to giving alms secretly for it
covers shortcomings, giving alms openly for it protects against a bad death and extending
benefits (to people) for it saves from positions of disgrace.
About the Holy Qur'an and Sunnah
Go ahead with the remembrance of Allah for it is the best remembrance, and long for that
which He has promised to the pious, for His promise is the most true promise. Tread the
course of the Prophet for it is the most distinguished course.
Follow the sunnah of the Prophet for it is the most right of all behaviours. Learn the Qur'an
for it is the fairest of discourses and understand it thoroughly for it is the best blossoming of
hearts.
Seek cure with its light for it is the cure for hearts. Recite it beautifully for it is the most
beautiful narration. Certainly, a scholar who acts not according to his knowledge is like the
off-headed ignorant who does not find relief from his ignorance, but on the learned the plea of
Allah is greater and grief more incumbent, and he is more blameworthy before Allah.
