About keeping aloof from oppression and misappropriation.
`Aqil's condition of poverty and destitution
By Allah, I would rather pass a night in wakefulness on the thorns of as-sa`dan (a plant
having sharp prickles) or be driven in chains as a prisoner than meet Allah and His Messenger
on the Day of Judgement as an oppressor over any person or a usurper of anything out of
worldly wealth.
And how can I oppress any one for (the sake of a life) that is fast moving towards destruction
and is to remain under the earth for a long time.
By Allah, I certainly saw (my brother) `Aqil fallen in destitution and he asked me a sa` (about
three kilograms in weight) out of your (share of) wheat, and I also saw his children with
dishevelled hair and a dusty countenance due to starvation, as though their faces had been
blackened by indigo. He came to me several times and repeated his request to me again and
again.
I heard him, and he thought I would sell my faith to him and follow his tread leaving my own
way. Then I (just) heated a piece of iron and took it near his body so that he might take a
lesson from it, then he cried as a person in protracted illness cries with pain and he was about
to get burnt with its branding. Then I said to him, "Moaning women may moan over you, O'
`Aqil.
Do you cry on account of this (heated) iron which has been made by a man for fun while you
are driving me towards the fire which Allah, the Powerful, has prepared for (a manifestation
of) His wrath? Should you cry from pain, but I should not cry from the flames?"
A stranger incident than this is that a man (1) came to us in the night;with a closed flask full
of honey paste but I disliked it as though it was the saliva of a serpent or its vomit. I asked
him whether it was a reward, or zakat (poor-tax) or charity, for these are forbidden to us
members of the Prophet's family. He said it was neither this nor that but a present. Then I
said, "Childless women may weep over you. Have you come to deviate me from the religion
of Allah, or are you mad, or have you been overpowered by some jinn, or are you speaking
without senses? "
By Allah, even if I am given all the domains of the seven (stars) with all that exists under the
skies in order that I may disobey Allah to the extent of snatching one grain of barley from an
ant I would not do it. For me your world is lighter than the leaf in the mouth of a locust that is
chewing it.
What has `Ali to do with bounties that will pass away and pleasures that will not last? We do
seek protection of Allah from the slip of wisdom and the evils of mistakes, and from Him we
seek succour.
