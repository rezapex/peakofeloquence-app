Herein Amir al-mu'minin tells people how to pronounce "as-salat" (to invoke Divine
blessing) on the Prophet.
My Allah, the Spreader of the surfaces (of earth) and Keeper (intact) of all skies, Creator of
hearts on good and evil nature, send Thy choicest blessings and growing favours on
Muhammad Thy servant and Thy Prophet who is the last of those who preceded (him) and an
opener for what is closed, proclaimer of truth with truth, repulser of the forces of wrong and
crusher of the onslaughts of misguidance.
As he was burdened (with responsibility of prophethood) so he bore it standing by Thy
commands, advancing towards Thy will, without shrinking of steps of weakness of
determination, listening to Thy revelation, preserving Thy testament, proceeding forward in
the spreading of Thy commands till he lit fire for its seeker and lighted the path for the groper
in the dark.
Hearts achieved guidance through him after being ridden with troubles. He introduced clearly
guiding signs and shining injunctions. He is Thy trusted trustee, the treasurer of Thy treasured
knowledge, Thy witness on the Day of Judgement, Thy envoy of truth and Thy Messenger
towards the people.
My Allah prepare large place for him under Thy shade and award him multiplying good by
Thy bounty.
My Allah, give height to his construction above all other constructions, heighten his position
with Thee, grant perfection to his effulgence and perfect for him his light.
In reward for his discharging Thy prophetship, grant him that his testimony be admitted and
his speech be liked for his speech is just, and his judgements are clear-cut.
My Allah put us and him together in the pleasures of life, continuance of bounty, satisfaction
of desires, enjoyment of pleasures. ease of living, peace of mind and gifts of honour.
