A man from among the companions of Amir al-mu'minin stood up and said, "O' Amir almu'minin,
you first stopped us from Arbitration and thereafter gave order for it. We do not
know which of these two was more appropriate." Amir al-mu'minin struck one hand over the
other and said:
This is the reward of one who breaks pledge. By Allah, when I gave you my orders (namely)
to abide by arbitration I had led you to an undesirable thing (namely war) in which Allah had
ordained good. If you had been steadfast I would have guided you, if you had been bent I
would have straightened you and if you had refused I would have rectified you. This was the
surest way.
But with whom and to whom. I wanted my treatment from you but you proved to be my
disease, like the extractor of thorn with the thorn when he knows that the thorn bends towards
itself.
My Allah, the physicians have despaired of this fatal ailment and water-drawers have become
tired with the rope of this well. Where (1) are those who were invited to Islam and they
accepted it? They read the Qur'an and decided according to it.
They were exhorted to fight and they leapt (towards it) as she-camels leap towards their
young. They took their swords out of the sheaths and went out into the world in groups and
rows. Some of them perished and some survived. The good news of survival does not please
them nor do they get condoled about the dead. Their eyes have turned white with weeping.
Their bellies are emaciated because of fasting. Their lips are dry because of (constant)
praying. Their colour is pale because of wakefulness. Their faces bear the dust of Godfearing.
These are my comrades who have departed. We should be justified if we feel eager
for them and bite our hands in their separation.
Certainly, Satan has made his ways easy for you and wants to unfasten the knots of religion
one by one and to cause division among you in place of unity. Keep away from his evil ideas
and enchantments and accept good advice of one who offers it to you and preserve it in your
minds.
(1) Although all those who fought under the banner of Amir al-mu'minin were called Shi`ahs
of `Ali, yet only those who had tears in their eyes, paleness on their faces, the Qur'anic verses
on their tongues, zeal of religion in their hearts, steadfastness in their feet, determination and
courage in their spirits, and patience and endurance in their minds could in true sense he
called Shi`ahs of `AIi.
These were the people in whose separation Amir al-mu'minin's feelings were coming out in the
shape of sighs through the breath, while the flames of the fire of separation were consuming
his heart and spirit. These were the people who leapt towards death like mad men and did not
feel happy if they survived. Rather, their heart's slogan was as the Persian hemistich says:
We are ashamed why we have remained alive.
He who has even a slight brilliance of these qualities can alone be called the follower of the
Descendants of the Prophet or the Shi`ah of `Ali, otherwise it would be a word which has lost
its meaning and been bereft of its dignity through misuse.
Thus tradition has it that Amir al-mu'minin saw a group of men at his door and enquired from
Qanbar who they were and he answered they were his Shi`ahs. On hearing this Amir almu'minin
had a frown on his forehead and said.
"Why are they called Shi`ahs? They have no sign of Shi`ahs." Thereupon Qanbar enquired
what were the signs of Shi`ahs and Amir al-mu'minin replied:
Their bellies are thin through hunger, their lips dry through thirst and their eyes
bleared through weeping.
