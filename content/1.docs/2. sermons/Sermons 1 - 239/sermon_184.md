Praise of Allah for His bounties
Praise be to Allah Who is recognised without being seen and Who creates without trouble. He
created the creation with His Might, and receives the devotion of rulers by virtue of His
dignity.
He exercises superiority over great men through His generosity. It is He who made His
creation to populate the world and sent towards the jinn and human beings His messengers to
unveil it for them, to warn them of its harm, to present to them its examples, to show them its
defects and to place before them a whole collection of matters containing lessons about the
changings of health and sickness in this world, its lawful things and unlawful things and all
that Allah has ordained for the obedient and the disobedient, namely, Paradise and Hell and
honour and disgrace. I extend my praise to His Being as He desires His creation to praise Him.
He has fixed for everything a measure, for every measure a time limit, and for every time
limit a document.
A part of the same sermon
About the greatness and importance of the Holy Qur'an
The Qur'an orders as well as refrains, remains silent and also speaks. It is the proof of Allah
before His creation. He has taken from them a pledge (to act) upon it. He has perfected its
effulgence, and completed through it His religion. He let the Prophet leave this world when he
had conveyed to the people all His commands of guidance through the Qur'an.
You should therefore regard Allah great as he has held Himself great, because He has not
concealed anything of His religion from you, nor has He left out anything which He likes or
which He dislikes, but He made for it a clear emblem (of guidance) and a definite sign which
either refrains from it or calls towards it. His pleasure is the same for all time to come.
You should know that He will not be pleased with you for anything for which He was
displeased with those before you, and He will not be displeased with you for anything for
which He was pleased with those before you. You are treading on a clear path, and are
speaking the same as the people before you had spoken. Allah is enough for your needs in this
world. He has persuaded you to remain thankful, and has made it obligatory on you to
mention Him with your tongues.
Warning against punishment on the Day of Judgement
He has advised you to exercise fear and has made it the highest point of His pleasure and all
that He requires from His creatures. You should therefore fear Allah, who is such that you are
as though just in front of Him, and your forelocks are in His grip, and your change of position
is in His control. If you conceal a matter, He will know of it.
If you disclose a matter, He will record it. For this He has appointed honoured guards (angels)
who do not omit any rightful matter nor include anything incorrect. You should know that
whoever fears Allah, He would make for him a way to get out of troubles and (grant him) a
light (to help him) out of darkness.
He will ever keep him in whatever condition) he wishes, and will make him stay in a position
of honour near Himself, in the house which He has made for Himself.
The shade of this house is His house is His throne, its light is His effulgence, its visitors are
His angels and its companions are His prophets.
Therefore, hasten towards the place of return and go ahead of (your) deaths (by collecting
provision for the next world). Shortly, the expectations of the people will be cut short and
death will overtake them while the door of repentance will be closed for them. You are still in
a place to which those who were before you have been wishing to return.
In this world, which is not your house, you are just a traveller in motion. You have been given
the call to leave from here, and you have been ordered to collect provision while you are here.
You should know that this thin skin cannot tolerate the Fire (of Hell). So, have pity on
yourselves because you have already tried it in the tribulations of the world.
Have you ever seen the crying of a person who has been pricked with a thorn or who bleeds
due to stumbling or whom hot sand has burnt? How would he feel when he is between two
frying pans of Hell with stones all round with Satan as his companion? Do you know that
when Malik (the guard-in-charge of Hell) is angry with the fire, its parts begin to clash with
each other (in rage), and, when he scolds it, it leaps between the doors of Hell crying on
account of his scolding.
O' you old and big whom old age has made hoary, how will you feel when rings of fire will
touch the bones of your neck, and handcuffs hold so hard that they eat away the flesh of the
forearms? (Fear) Allah ! Allah! O' crowd of men, while you are in good health before
sickness (grips you) and you are in ease before straitness (overtakes you).
You should try for the release of your necks before their mortgage is foreclosed, your eyes,
thin down bellies, use your feet, spend your money, take your bodies and spend them over
yourselves, and do not be niggardly about them, because Allah the Glorified, has said:
... if you help (in the way) of Allah, He will(also) help you, and will set firm
your feet. (Qur'an, 47:7)
and He, the Sublime. has said:
Who is he who would loan unto Allah a goodly loan? so that He may double it
for him, and for him shall be a noble recompense. (Qur'an, 57:11)
He does not seek your support because of any weakness, nor does He demand a loan from
you because of shortage. He seeks your help, although He possesses all the armies of the skies
and the earth and He is strong and wise. He seeks a loan from you, although He owns the
treasures of the skies and the earth and He is rich and praiseworthy.
(Rather) He intends to try you as to which of you performs good acts. You should therefore
be quick in performance of (good) acts so that your way be with His neighbours in His abode;
He made His Prophet's companions of these neighbours and made the angels to visit them. He
has honoured their ears so that the sound of Hell fire may never reach them, and He has
afforded protection to their bodies from weariness and fatigue.
. . . that is the grace of Allah, He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth;
and Allah is the Lord of Mighty Grace. (Qur'an, 57:21)
I say you are hearing. I seek Allah's help for myself and yourselves. He is enough for me and
He is the best dispenser.
