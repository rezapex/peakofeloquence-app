Praise of Allah, transience of this world, and causes of the decline of Allah's blessings.
(Delivered at the beginning of his caliphate after the killing of `Uthman)
One condition does not prevent Him from (getting into) another condition, time does not
change Him, place does not locate him and the tongue does not describe Him. The number of
drops of water, of stars in the sky, or of currents of winds in the air are not unknown to Him,
nor the movements of ants on rocks, or the resting place of grubs in the dark night.
He knows the places where leaves fall, and the secret movements of the pupils of the eyes.
I stand witness that there is no god but Allah, Who has no parallel, Who is not doubted,
Whose religion is not denied and Whose creativeness is not questioned.
My witnessing is like that of a man whose intention is free, whose conscience is clear, whose
belief is pure and whose loads (of good actions) are heavy. I also stand witness that
Muhammad - the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his progeny - is His slave and
His Messenger, chosen from His creations, selected for detailing His realities, picked for His
selected honours and chosen for His esteemed messages. Through him the signs of guidance
have been lighted and the gloom of blindness (misguidance) has been dispelled.
O' people, surely this world deceives him who longs for it and who is attracted towards it. It
does not behave niggardly with him who aspires for it and overpowers him who overpowers
it. By Allah, no people are deprived of the lively pleasures of life after enjoying them, except
as a result of sins committed by them, because certainly Allah is not unjust to His creatures.
Even then, when calamities descend upon people and pleasures depart from them, they turn
towards Allah with true intention and the feeling in their hearts that He will return them
everything that has fled from them and cure all their ills.
I fear about you lest you fall into ignorance (that prevailed before the appearance of the
Prophet). In the past there were certain matters in which you were deflected, and in my view
you were not worthy of admiration; but if your previous position could be returned to you
then you would become virtuous. I can only strive; but if I were to speak I would (only) say
may Allah forgive your past actions.
