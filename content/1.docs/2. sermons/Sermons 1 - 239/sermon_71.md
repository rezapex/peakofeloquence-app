description: This is sermon 71
---

Spoken on the morning of the day when Amir al-mu'minin was fatally struck with sword.
I was sitting when sleep overtook me. I saw the Prophet of Allah appear before me, and I
said: "O' Prophet of Allah ! what crookedness and enmity I had to face from the people.
" The prophet of Allah said: "Invoke (Allah) evil upon them," but I said, "Allah may change
them for me with better ones and change me for them with a worse one.
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: "al-awad" means crookedness and "al-ladad" means enmity, and this
is the most eloquent expression.
