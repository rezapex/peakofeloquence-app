About Talhah and az-Zubayr and the people of Basrah
Both of these two (Talhah and az-Zubayr) wishes the Caliphate for himself, and is drawing
towards himself as against the other fellow. They do not employ any connection for getting
access to Allah nor proceed towards Him through any means. Both of them bear malice
against the other.
Shortly his veil over it will be uncovered. By Allah, if they achieve what they aim at, one of
them will kill the other, and one will finish the other.
The rebellious party has stood up. Where are the seekers of virtue; for the paths have already
been determined and they have been given the news. For every misguidance there is a cause
and for every break of pledge there is a misrepresentation.
By Allah, I shall not be like him who listens to the voice of mourning, hears the man who
brings news of death and also visits the mourner yet does not take lesson.
