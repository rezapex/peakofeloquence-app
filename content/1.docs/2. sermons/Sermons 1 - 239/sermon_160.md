Good behaviour with people and ignoring their faults
I lived as a good neighbour to you and tried my best to look after you, and I freed you from
the snare of humbleness and the fetters of oppression through my gratefulness for the little
good (from your side) and closed my eyes to your many misdeeds which my eyes had
observed and my body had witnessed.
