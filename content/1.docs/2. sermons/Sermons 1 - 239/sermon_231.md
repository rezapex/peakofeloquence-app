About the Holy Prophet
The Prophet manifested whatever he was commanded and conveyed the messages of his
Lord. Consequently, Allah repaired through him the cracks, joined through him the slits and
created (through him) affection among kin although they bore intense enmity in (their) chests
and deep-seated rancour in (their) hearts.
