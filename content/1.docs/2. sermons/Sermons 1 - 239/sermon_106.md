In eulogy of the Holy Prophet
Then Allah deputised Muhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.p.) as a witness, giver of good tidings and
warner, the best in the universe as a child and the most chaste as a grown up man, the purest
of the purified in conduct, the most generous of those who are approached for generosity.
About the Ummayads
This world did not appear sweet to you in its pleasures and you did not secure milk from its
udders except after having met it when its nose-rein was trailing and its leather girth was
loose.
For certain people its unlawful items were like bent branches (laden with fruit) while its
lawful items were far away, not available. By Allah, you would find it like a long shade upto
a fixed time.
So the earth is with you without let or hindrance and your hands in it are extended while the
hands of the leaders are held away from you. Your swords are hanging over them while their
swords are held away from you.
Beware that for every blood (that is shed) there is an avenger and for every right there is a
claimant. The avenger for our blood is like the judge for his own claim, and it is Allah who is
such that if one seeks Him, then He does not disappoint him, and one who runs away from
Him cannot escape Him.
I swear by Allah, O' Banu Umayyah, shortly you will see it (i.e. your possession) in the hands
of others and in the house of your enemy. Know that the best looking eye is that whose sight
catches virtue and know that the best hearing ear is that which hears good advice and accepts
it.
About the functions of the Imams
O' people, secure light from the flame of lamps of the preacher who follows what he preaches
and draw water from the spring which has been cleaned of dirt.
O' creatures of Allah, do not rely on your ignorance, do not be obedient to your desires,
because he who stays at this place is like one who stays on the brink of a bank undermined by
water carrying ruin on his back from one portion to the other following his opinion which he
changes (one after the other). He wants to make adhere what cannot adhere and to bring
together what cannot keep together.
So fear Allah and do not place your complaints before him who cannot redress your
grievance, nor undo with his opinion what has been made obligatory for you.
Certainly, there is no obligation on the Imam except what has been devolved on him from
Allah, namely to convey warnings, to exert in good advice, to revive the sunnah, to enforce
penalties on those liable to them and to issue shares to the deserving.
So hasten towards knowledge before its vegetation dries up and before you turn yourselves
away from seeking knowledge from those who have it. Desist others from the unlawful and
abstain from it yourself, because you have been commanded to abstain (yourself) before
abstaining (others).
