title: Sermon 229
description: This is sermon 229
---

(About allegiance to Amir al-mu'minin for the Caliphate.
A similar sermon in somewhat different version has already appeared
earlier.)
You drew out my hand towards you for allegiance but I held it back and you stretched it but I
contracted it. Then you crowed over me as the thirsty camels crowd on the watering cisterns
on their being taken there, so much so that shoes were torn, shoulder-cloths fell away and the
weak got trampled, and the happiness of people on their allegiance to me was so manifested
that small children felt joyful, the old staggered (up to me) for it, the sick too reached for it
helter skelter and young girls ran for it without veils.
