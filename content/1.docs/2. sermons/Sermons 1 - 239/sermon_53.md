When in Siffin the men of Mu`awiyah
overpowered the men of Amir al-mu'minin and occupied the bank of River Euphrates and
prevented them from taking its water, Amir al-mu'minin said:
They(1) are asking you morsels of battle. So either you remain in ignominy and the lowest
position or drench your swords with blood and quench your thirst with water. Real death is in
the life of subjugation while real life is in dying as subjugators.
Beware, Mu`awiyah is leading a small group of insurgents and has kept them in dark about
the true facts with the result that they have made their bosoms the targets of death.
(1). Amir al-mu'minin had not reached Siffin when Mu`awiyah posted forty thousand men on
the bank of the River to close the way to the watering place, so that none except the Syrians
could take the water.
When Amir al-mu'mimin's force alighted there they found that there was no watering place
except this one for them to take water. If there was one it was difficult to reach there by
crossing high hillocks. Amir al-mu'minin sent Sa`sa`ah ibn Suhan al-`Abdi to Mu`awiyah with
the request to raise the control over water. Mu`awiyah refused. On this side Amir al-mu'minin's
army was troubled by thirst.
When Amir al-mu'minin noticed this position he said, "Get up and secure water by dint of
sword." Consequently, these thirsty persons drew their swords out of sheaths, put arrows in
their bows and dispersing Mu`awiyah's men went right down into the River and then hit these
guards away and occupied the watering place themselves.
Now, Amir al-mu'minin's men also desired that just as Mu`awiyah had put restriction on water
by occupation of the watering place, the same treatment should be accorded to him and his
men and no Syrian should be allowed water and everyone of them should be made to die of
thirst.
But Amir al-mu'minin said, "Do you want to take the same brutal step which these Syrians had
taken? Never prevent anyone from water.
Whoever wants to drink, may drink and whoever wants to take away may take away."
Consequently, despite occupation of the River by Amir al-mu'minin's army no one was
prevented from the water and everyone was given full liberty to take water.
