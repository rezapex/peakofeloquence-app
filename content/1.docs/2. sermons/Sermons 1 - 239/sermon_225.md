Supplication
O' my Allah! preserve (the grace of) my face with easiness of life and do not disgrace my
countenance with destitution, lest I may have to beg a livelihood from those who beg from
Thee, try to seek the favour of Thy evil creatures, engage myself in praising those who give to
me, and be tempted in abusing those who do not give to me, although behind all these Thou
art the master of giving and denying.
. . . Verily Thou over all things, art the All-powerful. (Qur'an, 66:8)
