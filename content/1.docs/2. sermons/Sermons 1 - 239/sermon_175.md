About Talhah ibn `Ubaydillah
Delivered when he received the news that Talhah and az-Zubayr had already left for Basrah to
fight against him.
As for me, I would never be frightened of fighting or be made to fear striking because I am
satisfied with Allah's promise of support to me. By Allah, Talhah has hastened with drawn
sword to avenge `Uthman's blood for fear lest the demand for `Uthman's blood be made
against himself, because the people's idea in this matter is about him, and, in fact, he was the
most anxious among them for his killing.
Therefore, he has tried to create misunderstanding by collecting forces in order to confuse the
matter and to create doubt.
By Allah. he did not act in either of three ways about `Uthman. If the son of `Affan
(`Uthman) was in the wrong, as Talhah believed, it is necessary for him to support those who
killed (1) him or to keep away from his supporters. If `Uthman was the victim of oppression.
then Talhah should have been among those who were keeping (the assaulters) away from him
or were advancing pleas on his behalf.
If he was in doubt about these two alternatives, then it was incumbent upon him to leave him
(`Uthman) and retire aside and leave the men with him (to deal with him as they wished). But
he adopted none of these three ways, and came out with a thing in which there is no good, and
his excuses are not acceptable.
(1). It means that if Talhah considered `Uthman an oppressor, then after his assassination,
instead of getting ready to avenge his blood, he should have supported his killers and justified
their action.
It is not the intention that in the case of `Uthman being in the wrong Talhah should have
supported the attackers because he was already supporting and encouraging them.
