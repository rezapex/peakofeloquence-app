title: Sermon 50
description: This is sermon 50
---

Delivered at the time of marching towards Syria.
Praise is due to Allah when night spreads and darkens, and praise be to Allah whenever the
star shines and sets. And praise be to Allah whose bounty never misses and whose favours
cannot be repaid.
Well, I have sent forward my vanguard (1) and have ordered them to remain in camp on this
bank of the River till my order reaches them. My intention is that I should cross this water
over to the small habitation of people residing on the sides of the Tigris and rouse them to
march with you towards the enemy and keep them as auxiliary force for you.
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: Here by "mitat " Amir al-mu'minin has meant the direction where he
had ordered the men to camp and that was the bank of the Euphrates, and "mitat " is used for
the bank of a river although its literal meaning is level ground whereas by "nutfah " he means
the water of the Euphrates, and these are amazing expressions.
(1). Amir al-mu'minin delivered this sermon when he camped at the Valley of an-Nukhaylah on
Wednesday the 5th Shawwal 37 A.H. on his way to Siffin.
The Vanguard mentioned herein means the twelve thousand persons whom he had sent
towards Siffin under the command of Ziyad ibn an-Nadr and Shurayh ibn Hani, while the small
force of al-Mada'in mentioned by him was a contingent of twelve hundred men who had come
up in response to Amir al-mu'minin's call.
