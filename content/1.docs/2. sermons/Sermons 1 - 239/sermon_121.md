About the greatness of Ahlu'l-bayt and the importance of the laws of
Islam
By Allah, I have knowledge of the conveyance of messages, fulfilment of promises and of
entire expressions. We the people of the house (of the Prophet - Ahlu'l-bayt) possess the doors
of wisdom and light of governance. Beware that the paths of religion are one and its highways
are straight.
He who follows them achieves (the aim) and secures (the objective). And he who stood away
from it went astray and incurred repentance.
Do act for the day for which provisions are stored, and when the intentions would be tested. If
a person's own intelligence which is present with him does not help him, the wits (of others)
which are remote from him are more unhelpful and those which are away from him more
useless.
Dread the fire whose flame is severe, whose hollow is deep, whose dress is iron and whose
drink is bloody pus. Beware! The(1) good name of a man retained by Allah, the Sublime,
among the people is better than wealth inherited by those who would not praise him.
(1). If a person gives away something in his life time then the recipient feels obliged to him.
But if wealth is extracted by force then the extractor does not feel himself under his obligation,
nor does he praise it.
The same is the case of one who dies. His successors think that whatever he had left behind
was their right and they should have received it. In this there is no obligation of his to be
acknowledged.
But if he had done some good act with this very wealth his name would have remained behind
him and people would have praised him also. A Persian couplet says:
Happy is he who is remembered well after himself, for nothing save the name
remains after the man is dead.
