About collecting provision for the next world while in this world and
performing good acts before death
Perform (good) acts while you are still in the vastness of life, the books are open (for
recording of actions), repentance is allowed, the runner away (from Allah) is being called and
the sinner is being given hope (of forgiveness) before the (light of) action is put off, time
expires, life ends, the door for repentance is closed and angels ascend to the sky.
Therefore a man should derive benefit from himself for himself, from the living for the dead,
from the mortal, for the lasting and from the departer for the stayer. A man should fear Allah
while he is given age to live upto his death, and is allowed time to act.
A man should control his self by the rein and hold it with its bridle, thus by the rein he should
prevent it from disobedience towards Allah, and by the bridle he should lead it towards
obedience to Allah.
