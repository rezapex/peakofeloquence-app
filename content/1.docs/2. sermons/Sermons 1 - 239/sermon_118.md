Rebuking Misers
You spend no wealth in the cause of Him Who gave it, nor do you risk your lives for the sake
of Him Who created them. You enjoy honour through Allah among His creatures, but you do
not honour Allah among His creatures.
You should derive lessons from your occupying the places of those who were before you and
from the departure of your nearest brothers.
