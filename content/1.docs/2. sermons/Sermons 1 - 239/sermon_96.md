About the condition of the people at the time of the Prophet's proclamation and his
actions to do with the dissemination of his message
Allah sent the Prophet at a time when the people were going astray in perplexity and were
moving here and there in mischief. Desires had deflected them and self-conceit had swerved
them. Extreme ignorance had made them foolish. They were confounded by the unsteadiness
of matters and the evils of ignorance.
Then the Prophet - blessing of Allah be upon him and his descendants - did his best in giving
them sincere advice, himself trod on the right path and called (them) towards wisdom and
good counsel.
