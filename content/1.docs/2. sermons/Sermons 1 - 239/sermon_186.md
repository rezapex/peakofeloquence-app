Praise of Allah and His wonderful creatures
Praise be to Allah. He is such that senses cannot perceive Him, place cannot contain Him,
eyes cannot see Him and veils cannot cover Him. He proves His eternity by the coming into
existence of His creation, and (also) by originating His creation (He proves) His existence,
and by their (mutual) similarity He proves that there is nothing similar to Him. He is true in
His promise. He is too high to be unjust to His creatures.
He stands by equity among His creation and practices justice over them in His commands. He
provides evidence through the creation of things of His being from ever, through their marks
of incapability of His power, and through their powerlessness against death of His eternity.
He is One, but not by counting. He is everlasting without, any limit. He is existent without
any support. Minds admit of Him without (any activity of the) senses. Things which can be
seen stand witness to Him without confronting Him. Imagination cannot encompass Him. He
manifests Himself to the imagination with his help for the imagination, and refuses to be
imagined by the imagination. He has made imagination the arbiter (in this matter).
He is not big in the sense that volume is vast and so His body is also big. Nor is He great in
the sense that His limits should extend to the utmost and so His frame be extensive. But He is
big in position and great in authority.
About the Holy Prophet
I stand witness that Muhammad is His slave, His chosen Prophet and His responsible trustee
-- may Allah bless him and his descendants. Allah sent him with undeniable proofs, a clear
success and open paths. So he conveyed the message declaring the truth with it. He led the
people on the (correct) highway, established signs of guidance and minarets of light, and
made Islam's ropes strong and its knots firm.
A part of the same sermon
About the creation of animal species
Had they pondered over the greatness of His power and the vastness of His bounty they
would have returned to the right path and feared the punishment of the Fire; but hearts are
sick and eyes are impure.
Do they not see the small things He has created, how He strengthened their system and
opened for them hearing and sight and made for them bones and skins? Look at the ant with
its small body and delicate form. It can hardly be seen in the corner of the eye, nor by the
perception of the imagination - how it moves on the earth and leaps at its livelihood. It carries
the grain to its hole and deposits it in its place of stay.
It collects during the summer for its winter, and during strength for the period of its weakness.
Its livelihood is guaranteed, and it is fed according to fitness. Allah, the Kind, does not forget
it and (Allah the Giver) does not deprive it, even though it may be in dry stone or fixed rocks.
If you have thought about its digestive tracts in its high and low parts, the carapace of its
belly, and its eyes and its ears in its head you would be amazed at its creation and you would
feel difficulty in describing it. Exalted is He who made it stand on its legs and erected it on its
pillars (of limbs). No other originator took part with Him in its origination and no one having
power assisted Him in its creation.
If you tread on the paths of your imagination and reach its extremity it will not lead you
anywhere except that the Originator of the ant is the same as He who is the Originator of the
date-palm, because everything has (the same) delicacy and detail, and every living being has
little difference.
The Creation of the Universe
In His creation, the big, the delicate, the heavy, the light, the strong, the weak are all equal.(1)
So is the sky, the air, the winds and the water. Therefore, you look at the sun, moon,
vegetation, plants, water, stone, the difference of this night and day, the springing of the
streams, the large number of the mountains, the height of their peaks, the diversity of
languages and the variety of tongues. Then woe be to him who disbelieves in the Ordainer
and denies the Ruler. They believe that they are like grass for which there is no cultivator nor
any maker for their diverse shapes.
They have not relied on any argument for what they assert, nor on any research for what they
have heard. Can there be any construction without a Constructor, or any offence without an
offender.
The wonderful creation of the locust
If you wish you can tell about the locust (as well). Allah gave it two red eves, lighted for them
two moon -- like pupils, made for it small ears, opened for it a suitable mouth and gave it
keen sense, gave it two teeth to cut with and two sickle-like feet to grip with. The farmers are
afraid of it in the matter of crops since they cannot drive it away even though they may join
together. The locust attacks the fields and satisfies its desires (of hunger) from them although
its body is not equal to a thin finger.
About the Glory of Allah
Glorified is Allah before Whom every one in the skies or the earth bows in prostration
willingly or unwillingly, submits to Him by placing his cheeks and face (in the dust), drops
before Him (in obedience) peacefully and humbly, and hands over to Him full control in fear
and apprehension.
The birds are bound by His commands. He knows the number of their feathers and their
breaths. He has made their feet to stand on water and on land. He has ordained their
livelihoods. He knows their species: this is the crow, this is the eagle, this is the pigeon and
this is the ostrich. He called out every bird with its name (while creating it) and provided it
with its livelihood.
He created heavy clouds and produced from them heavy rain and spread it on various lands.
He drenched the earth after its dryness and grew vegetation from it after its barrenness.
(1). The meaning is that if the smallest thing in creation is examined it will be found to contain
all that which is found in the biggest creatures, and each will exhibit the same reflection of
natures, workmanship and performance, and the ratio of each to Allah's might and power will
be the same, whether it be as small as an ant or as big as a date palm. Is it not that making a
small thing is easy for Him while the making of a big thing is difficult for Him, because the
diversity of colour, volume and quantity is just based on the dictates of His sagacity and
expediency, but as regards creation itself there is no difference among them. Therefore, this
uniformity of creation is a proof of the oneness and unity of the Creator.
