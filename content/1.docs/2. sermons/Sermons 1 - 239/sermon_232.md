`Abdullah ibn Zama`ah who was one of the followers of Amir al-mu'minin came to him
during his Caliphate to ask for some money when Amir al-mu'minin said:
This money is not for me nor for you, but it is the collective property of the Muslims and the
acquisition of their swords. If you had taken part with them in their fighting you would have a
share equal to theirs, otherwise the earning of their hands cannot be for other than their
mouths.
