Grounds for accepting the Caliphate and the qualities of a ruler and
governor
O' (people of) differing minds and divided hearts, whose bodies are present but wits are
absent. I am leading you (amicably) towards truthfulness, but you run away from it like goats
and sheep running away from the howling of a lion. How hard it is for me to uncover for you
the secrets of justice, or to straighten the curve of truthfulness.
O' my Allah! Thou knowest that what we did was not to seek power nor to acquire anything
from the vanities of the world. We rather wanted to restore the signs of Thy religion and to
usher prosperity into Thy cities so that the oppressed among Thy creatures might be safe and
Thy forsaken commands might be established. O' my Allah! I am the first who leaned
(towards Thee) and who heard and responded (to the call of Islam). No one preceded me in
prayer (salat) except the Prophet.
You certainly know that he who is in charge of honour, life, booty, (enforcement of) legal
commandments and the leadership of the Muslims should not be a miser as his greed would
aim at their wealth, nor be ignorant as he would then mislead them with his ignorance, nor be
of rude behaviour who would estrange them with his rudeness, nor should he deal unjustly
with wealth thus preferring one group over another, nor should he accept a bribe while taking
decisions, as he would forfeit (others) rights and hold them up without finality, nor should he
ignore sunnah as he would ruin the people.
