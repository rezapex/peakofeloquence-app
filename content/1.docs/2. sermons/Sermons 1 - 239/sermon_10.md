About Talhah and az-Zubayr
Beware! Satan (1) has collected his group and assembled his horse-men and foot-soldiers.
Surely, with me is my sagacity. I have neither deceived myself nor ever been deceived. By
Allah I shall fill to the brim for them a cistern from which I alone would draw water. They
can neither turn away from it nor return to it.
(1). When Talhah and az-Zubayr broke away by violating the Oath of allegiance and set for
Basrah in the company of `A'ishah, Amir al-mu'minin spoke in these words which are part of
the long speech. Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written that in this sermon Satan denotes the real Satan
as well as Mu`awiyah because Mu`awiyah was secretly conspiring with Talhah and az-Zubayr
and instigating them to fight against Amir al-mu'minin but the reference to the real Satan is
more appropriate, obvious and in accord with the situation and circumstances.
