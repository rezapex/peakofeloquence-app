title: Sermon 16
description: This is sermon 16
---

Delivered when allegiance was sworn to him at Medina
The responsibility for what I say is guaranteed and I am answerable for it. He to whom
experiences have clearly shown the past exemplary punishments (given by Allah to peoples)
is prevented by piety from falling into doubts. You should know that the same troubles have
returned to you which existed when the Prophet was first sent.
By Allah who sent the Prophet with faith and truth you will be severely subverted, bitterly
shaken as in sieving and fully mixed as by spooning in a cooking pot till your low persons
become high and high ones become low, those who were behind would attain forward
positions and those who were forward would become backward. By Allah, I have not
concealed a single word or spoken any lie and I had been informed of this event and of this
time.
Beware that sins are like unruly horses on whom their riders have been placed and their reins
have been let loose so that they would jump with them in Hell. Beware that piety is like
trained horses on whom the riders have been placed with the reins in their hands, so that they
would take the riders to Heaven. There is right and wrong and there are followers for each. If
wrong dominates, it has (always) in the past been so, and if truth goes down that too has often
occurred. It seldom happens that a thing that lags behind comes forward.
ash-Sharif ar-Radi says: In this small speech there is more beauty than can be appreciated,
and the quantity of amazement aroused by it is more than the appreciation accorded to it.
Despite what we have stated it has so many aspects of eloquence that cannot be expressed nor
can anyone reach its depth, and no one can understand what I am saying unless one has
attained this art and known its details.
. . . No one appreciates it except those who know (Qur'an, 29:43)
From the same Sermon
He who has heaven and hell in his view has no other aim. He who attempts and acts quickly,
succeeds, while the seeker who is slow may also entertain hope, and he who falls short of
action faces destruction in Hell. On right and left there are misleading paths. Only the middle
way is the (right) path which is the Everlasting Book and the traditions of the Prophet. From it
the sunnah has spread out and towards it is the eventual return.
He who claims (otherwise) is ruined and he who concocts falsehood is disappointed. He who
opposes(1) right with his face gets destruction. It is enough ignorance for a man not to know
himself. He who is strong rooted(2) in piety does not get destruction, and the plantation of a
people based on piety never remains without water. Hide yourselves in your houses and
reform yourselves. Repentance is at your back. One should praise only Allah and condemn
only his own self.
(1). In some versions after the words "man abda safhatahu lilhaqqi halaka:" the words "`inda
jahalati'n-nas" also occur. In that case the meaning of this sentence would be that he who
stands in face of right dies in the estimation of the ignorant.
(2). Piety is the name of heart and mind being affected and impressed by the Divine Greatness
and Glory, as an effect of which the spirit of man becomes full of fear of Allah, and its
inevitable result is that engrossment in worship and prayer increases. It is impossible that heart
may be full of Divine fear and there be no manifestation of it in actions and deeds. And since
worship and submission reform the heart and nurture the spirit, purity of heart increases with
the increase of worship.
That is why in the Qur'an "taqwa" (piety) has been applied sometimes to fear, sometimes to
worship and devotion and sometimes to purity of heart and spirit. Thus in the verse "wa iyyaya
fattaqun" (and Me you fear [16:2]) taqwa implies fear, in the verse, "ittaqu'l-laha haqqa
tuqatihi" (worship Allah as He ought to be worshipped [3:102]), taqwa implies worship and
devotion and in the verse "wa yakhsha'l-laha wa yattaqhi faulaika humu'l-faizun" (24:52) taqwa
implies purity of spirit and cleanliness of heart.
In the traditions taqwa has been assigned three degrees. The first degree is that a man should
follow the injunctions and keep aloof from prohibitions. The second degree is that
recommended matters should also be followed and disliked things should be avoided. The third
degree is that for fear of falling into doubts one may abstain from the permissible as well. The
first degree is for the common men, the second for the nobles and the third for high
dignitaries. Allah has referred to these three degrees in the following verse:
On those who believe and do good, is no blame for what they ate, (before) when they did
guard themselves and did believe, and did good, still (furthermore) they guard themselves and
do good; and Allah loveth the doers of good. (Qur'an, 5:93)
Amir al-mu'minin says that only action based on piety is lasting, and only that action will
blossom and bear fruit which is watered by piety because worship is only that wherein the
feeling of submission exists. Thus, Allah says:
Is he therefore better who hath laid his foundation on fear of Allah and (His) goodwill or he
who layeth his foundation on the brink of a crumbling hollowed bank so it crumbled down with
him into the fire of Hell... (Qur'an, 9:109)
Consequently, every such belief as is not based on knowledge and conviction is like the edifice,
erected without foundation, wherein there is no stability or firmness while every action that is
without piety is like the plantation which withers for lack of watering.
