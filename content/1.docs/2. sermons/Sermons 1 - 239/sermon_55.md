On the swearing of allegiance
They leapt upon me as the camels leap upon each other on their arrival for drinking water,
having been let loose after unfastening of their four legs till I thought they would either kill
me or kill one another in front of me.
I thought over this matter in and out to the extent that it prevented me from sleeping. But I
found no way except to fight them or else to reject whatever has been brought by Muhammad
(PBUHAHP).
I found that to face war was easier for me than to face the retribution, and the hardships of
this world were easier than the hardships of the next world.
