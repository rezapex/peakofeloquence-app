In the battle of Siffin Amir al-mu'minin saw Imam al-Hasan proceeding rapidly to fight,
then he said:
Hold back this young man on my behalf, lest he causes my ruin, because I am loath to send
these two (meaning al-Hasan and al-Husayn) towards death, lest the descending line of the
Prophet - may Allah bless him and his descendants - is cut away by their death.
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: Amir al-mu'minin's words "amliku `anni hadha'l- ghulam" (i.e. "Hold
back this young man on my behalf") represents the highest and the most eloquent form of
expression.
