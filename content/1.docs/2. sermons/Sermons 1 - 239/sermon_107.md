About Islam
Praise be to Allah who established Islam and made it easy for those who approach it and gave
strength to its columns against any one who tries to overpower it.
So Allah made it (a source of) peace for him who clings to it, safety for him who enters it,
argument for him who speaks about it, witness for him who fights with its help, light for him
who seeks light from it, understanding for him who provides it, sagacity for him who exerts, a
sign (of guidance) for him who perceives, sight for him who resolves, lesson for him who
seeks advice, salvation for him who testifies, confidence for him who trusts, pleasure for him
who entrusts, and shield for him who endures.
It is the most bright of all paths, the clearest of all passages. It has dignified minarets, bright
highways, burning laps, prestigious field of activity, and high objective. It has a collection of
race horses. It is approached eagerly. Its riders are honourable.
Testimony (of Allah, Prophet etc.) is its way, good deeds are its minarets, death is its
extremity, this world is its race-course, the Day of Judgement is its horses and Paradise is its
point of approach.
A part of the same sermon about the Holy Prophet
The Prophet lighted flames for the seeker and put bright signs for the impeded. So he is Thy
trustworthy trustee, Thy witness on the Day of Judgement, Thy deputy as a blessing and Thy
messenger of truth as mercy. My Allah distribute to him a share from Thy Justice and award
him multiples of good by Thy bounty.
My Allah heighten his construction over the constructions of others, honour him when he
comes to Thee, dignify his position before Thee, give him honourable position, and award
him glory and distinction, and bring us out (on the Day of Judgement) among his party,
neither ashamed, nor repentant, nor deviators, nor pledge-breakers, nor strayers, nor
misleaders. nor seduced.
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: This sermon had already appeared earlier but we have repeated it here
because of the difference between the two versions.
A part of the same sermon addressed to his followers
By bounty of Allah over you, you have acquired a position where even your slave maids are
honoured, your neighbours are treated well. Even he over whom you enjoy no distinction or
obligation honours you. Even those people fear you who had no apprehension of attack from
you or any authority over you. You now see pledges to Allah being broken but do not feel
enraged although you fret and frown on the breaking of the traditions of your forefathers.
Allah's matters have been coming to you, and going from and again coming back to you; but
you have made over your place to wrong-doers and thrown towards them your
responsibilities, and have placed Allah's affairs in their hands.
They act in doubts and tread in (fulfilment of) desires. By Allah, even if they disperse you
under every star Allah would surely collect you on the day that would be worst for them.
