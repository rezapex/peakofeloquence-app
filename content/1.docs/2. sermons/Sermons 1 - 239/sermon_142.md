Against reliance on heresy
O' people! If a person knows his brother to be steadfast in faith and of correct ways he should
not lend ear to what people may say about him.
Sometimes the bowman shoots arrows but the arrow goes astray; similarly talk can be off the
point. Its wrong perishes, while Allah is the Hearer and the Witness. There is nothing between
truth and falsehood except four fingers.
Amir al-mu'minin was asked the meaning of this whereupon he closed his fingers together
and put them between his ear and eye and said: It is falsehood when you say, "I have heard
so," while it is truth when you say, "have seen."
