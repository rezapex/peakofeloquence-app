About those who give up supporting right
O' my Allah! whoever listens to our utterance which is just and which seeks the prosperity of
religion and the worldly life and does not seek mischief, but rejects it after listening, then he
certainly turns away from Thy support and desists from strengthening Thy religion.
We make Thee a witness over him and Thou art the greatest of all witnesses, and we make all
those who inhabit Thy earth and Thy skies witness over him. Thereafter, Thou alone can
make us needless of his support and question him for his sin.
