One should not be afraid of the scarcity of those who tread on the
right path
O' people, do not wonder at the small number of those who follow the right path, because
people throng only round the table (of this world) whose edibles are few but whose hunger is
insatiable.
O' people, certainly, what gathers people together (in categories) is (their) agreement (to good
or bad) and (their) disagreement, for only one individual killed the camel of Thamud (1) but
Allah held all of them in punishment because all of them joined him by their acquiescing in
their consenting to it. Thus, Allah, the Glorified. has said:
Then they hamstrung her, and turned (themselves) regretful. (Qur'an, 26:157).
Then their land declined by sinking (into the earth) as the spike of a plough pierces
unploughed weak land. O' people, he who treads the clear path (of guidance) reaches the
spring of water, and whoever abandons it strays into waterless desert.
(1). Thamud, in ancient Arabia, a tribe or group of tribes, seems to have been prominent from
about the 4th Century B.C. to the first half of the 7th Century A.D. Their place of stay and
homeland was at a place lying on the way between the Hijaz and Syria called the Valley of al-
Qura and bore this name because it consisted of several townships.
Allah deputed for their guidance and directions the Prophet Salih who preached to them as
Allah relates in his story:
And unto (the people of) Thamud (We did send) their brother Salih, he said: "O'
my people! worship ye Allah (alone). Ye have no god other than Him; indeed
came unto you a clear proof from your Lord; this is the She-camel of Allah
(which) unto you is a sign, so leave it (free) to pasture in Allah's earth and touch
her not with any harm, or ye shall be seized with a painful chastisement. And
remember when He made you successors after the (people) `Ad and settled you
in the earth, ye build mansions on its plain and hew the mountains into
dwellings. So remember ye the bounties of Allah, and see ye not evil in the
earth, making mischief." Said the chiefs of those who were puffed up with pride
among his people to those who were reckoned weak, to those who believed
from among them; "Know ye that Salih is sent by his Lord?" Said they: "Verily, in
what he hath been sent with, we are believers." Said those who were puffed up
with pride; "Verily we, in that which ye believe are disbelievers." They
hamstrung the She-camel and rebelled against the command of their Lord, and
they said: "O' Salih! bring us what thou didst, threaten us with, if thou art of the
apostles.
" Then seized them (unawares) the earthquake, so became they in their
dwellings, motionless (dead). Then he turned away from them and said: "O' my
people! Indeed I did deliver unto you the message of my Lord, and did
admonish you, but ye love not the admonishers." (Qur'an, 7:73-79).
(The people of) Thamud belied the warners, and said they: "What! a single man,
from among us! and we to follow him? Verily then we shall be astray and in
distress. It is that (the duty of) reminding hath been bestowed on him (alone),
of all the (people) among us? Nay! he is a great liar, an insolent one!" "Soon
they shall know on the morrow, (as to) who is the liar, the insolent one! (O' Our
Apostle Salih!) verily We are going to send the She-camel as a trial for them; so
watch them and be patient.
And (thou O' Salih!) make them aware (beforehand) that the water is (to be)
divided between them; and every drinking share shall be witnessed (on it)." But
they called their companions, then he pursued (her) and hamstrung (her).
How (great) was My chastisement and My warning? Verily sent We upon them a
single (violent) blast, and they were (all) like the dry stubble used by a fencer in
a fence. (Qur'an, 54:23-31).
