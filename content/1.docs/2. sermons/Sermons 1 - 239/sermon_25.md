About keeping aloof from envy, and good behaviour towards kith and
kin
Now then, verily Divine orders descend from heaven to earth like drops of rain, bringing to
every one what is destined for him whether plenty or paucity. So if any one of you observes
for his brother plenty of progeny or of wealth or of self, it should not be a worry for him.
So long as a Muslim does not commit such an act that if it is disclosed he has to bend his eyes
(in shame) and by which low people are emboldened, he is like the gambler who expects that
the first draw of his arrow would secure him gain and also cover up the previous loss.
Similarly, the Muslim who is free from dishonesty expects one of the two good things: either
call from Allah and in that case whatever is with Allah is the best for him, or the livelihood of
Allah. He has already children and property while his faith and respect are with him.
Certainly, wealth and children are the plantations of this world while virtuous deed is the
plantation of the next world. Sometimes Allah joins all these in some groups.
Beware of Allah against what He has cautioned you and keep afraid of Him to the extent that
no excuse be needed for it. Act without show or intention of being heard, for if a man acts for
some one else then Allah makes him over to that one. We ask Allah (to grant us) the positions
of the martyrs, company of the virtuous and friendship of the prophets.
O' people! surely no one (even though he may be rich) can do without his kinsmen, and their
support by hands or tongues. They alone are his support from rear and can ward off from him
his troubles, and they are the most kind to him when tribulations befall him. The good
memory of a man that Allah retains among people is better than the property which others
inherit from him.
In the same sermon
Behold! If any one of you finds your near ones in want or starvation, he should not desist
from helping them with that which will not increase if this help is not extended, nor decrease
by thus spending it. Whoever holds up his hand from (helping) his kinsmen, he holds only
one hand, but at the time of his need many hands remain held up from helping him. One who
is sweet tempered can retain the love of his people for good.
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: In this sermon "al-ghafirah" means plenty or abundance, and this is
derived from the Arab saying, "al-jamm al-ghafir" or "al-jamma' al-ghafir" meaning thick
crowd. In some versions for "al-ghafirah" "`afwatan" appears. "`afwah" means the good and
selected part of anything.
It is said "akaltu `afwata 't-ta`am", to mean "I ate select meal." About "wa man yaqbid yadahu
`an `ashiratihi" appearing towards the end he points out how beautiful the meaning of this
sentence is, Amir al-mu'minin implies that he who does not help his own kinsmen withholds
only his hand but when he is in need of their assistance and would be looking for their
sympathy and support then he would remain deprived of the sympathies and succour of so
many of their extending hands and marching feet.
