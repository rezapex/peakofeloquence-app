In eulogy of the Holy Prophet
Praise be to Allah who is such First that nothing is before Him and such Last that there is
nothing after Him. He is such Manifest that there is nothing above Him and such Hidden that
there is nothing nearer than He.
A part of the same sermon about the Holy Prophet
His place of stay is the best of all places and his origin the noblest of all origins in the mines
of honour and the cradles of safety. Hearts of virtuous persons have been inclined towards
him and the reins of eyes have been turned towards him.
Through him Allah buried mutual rancour and put off the flames of revolt. Through him He
gave them affection like brothers and separated those who were together (through unbelief).
Through him He gave honour to the low and degraded honour (of unbelief). His speaking is
clear and his silence is (indicative) like tongue.
