title: Sermon 48
description: This is sermon 48
---

When Amir al-mu'minin decided to march towards Syria (ash-Sham)
he spoke these words:
My Allah, I seek Thy protection from the hardships of journey, from the grief of returning
and from the scene of devastation of property and men. O' Allah, Thou art the companion in
journey and Thou art one who is left behind for (protection of the) family. None except Thee
can join these two because one who is left behind cannot be a companion in journey nor one
who is in company on a journey can at the same time be left behind.
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: The earlier part of this sermon is related from the Prophet but Amir almu'minin
has completed it very aptly by adding most eloquent sentences at the end. This
addition is from "None except Thee can join" upto the end.
