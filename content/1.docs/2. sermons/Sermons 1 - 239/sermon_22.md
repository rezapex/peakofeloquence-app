Death and taking lessons from it
If you could see that has been seen by those of you who have died, you would be puzzled and
troubled. Then you would have listened and obeyed; but what they have seen is yet curtained
off from you. Shortly, the curtain would be thrown off. You have been shown, provided you
see and you have been made to listen provided you listen, and you have been guided if you
accept guidance. I spoke unto you with truth. You have been called aloud by (instructive)
examples and warned through items full of warnings. After the heavenly messengers (angels),
only man can convey message from Allah. (So what I am conveying is from Allah).
