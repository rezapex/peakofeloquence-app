When Amir al-mu'minin's companions expressed displeasure about his attitude
concerning Arbitration, (1) he said:
O' people, matters between me and you went as I wished till war exhausted you. By Allah, it
has overtaken some of you and left others, and has completely weakened your enemy.
Till yesterday I was giving orders but today I am being given orders, and till yesterday I was
dissuading people (from wrong acts) but today I am being dissuaded. You have now shown
liking to live in this world, and it is not for me to bring you to what you dislike.
(1). When the surviving forces of the Syrians lost ground and were ready to run away from the
field Mu`awiyah changed the whole phase of the battle by using the Qur'an as his instrument
of strategy, and succeeded in creating such a division among the Iraqis that, despite Amir almu'minin's
efforts at counselling, they were not prepared to take any forward step, but insisted
on stopping the war, whereupon Amir al-mu'minin too had to agree to arbitration.
Among these people some had actually been duped and believed that they were being asked
to abide by the Qur'an but there were others who had become weary of the long period of war
and had lost courage. Then people got a good opportunity to stop the war, and so they cried
hoarse for its postponement.
There were others who had accompanied Amir al-mu'minin because of his temporal authority
but did not support him by heart, nor did they aim at victory for him. There were some people
who had expectations with Mu`awiyah, and had started attaching hopes to him for this, while
there were some who were, from the very beginning, in league with him.
In these circumstances and with this type of the army it was really due to Amir al-mu'minin's
political ability and competence of military control and administration that he carried the war
up to this stage, and if Mu`awiyah had not adopted this trick there could have been no doubt
in Amir al-mu'minin's victory because the military power of the Syrian forces had been
exhausted and defeat was hovering over its head.
In this connection, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid writes:
Malik al-Ashtar had reached Mu`awiyah and grabbed him by the neck. The
entire might of the Syrians had been smashed. Only so much movement was
discernible in them as remains in the tail of a lizard which is killed, but the tail
continues hopping right and left. (Sharh Nahj al-balaghah, vol. 11, pp.30-31)
