About the hypocrites
They(1) have made Satan the master of their affairs, and he has taken them as partners. He
has laid eggs and hatched them in their bosoms. He creeps and crawls in their laps. He sees
through their eyes, and speaks with their tongues.
In this way he has led them to sinfulness and adorned for them foul things like the action of
one whom Satan has made partner in his domain and speaks untruth through his tongue.
(1). Amir al-mu'minin says about the hypocrites (i.e. those who opposed him before and
during his Caliphate) that they are partners in action of Satan and his helpers and supporters.
He too has befriended them so much that he has made his abode with them, resides on their
bosoms, lays eggs and hatches young one from them there, while these young ones jump and
play in their laps without demur. He means that Satanic evil ideas take birth in their bosoms
and grow and thrive there.
There is no restrain on them, nor restriction of any kind. He has so permeated in their blood
and mingled in their spirit that both have become completely unified. Now eyes are theirs but
sight is his, the tongue is theirs but the words are his, as the Prophet had said, "Verily, Satan
permeates the progeny of Adam like blood." That is, just as the circulation of blood does not
stop, in the same way the quick succession of Satan's evil ideas know no break and he draws
man towards evil in sleep and wakefulness, and in every posture, rising or sitting.
He so paints them with his dye that their word and action reflect an exact portrait of his word
and action. Those whose bosoms shine with the effulgence of faith prevent such evil ideas but
some are already ready to welcome those evils and these are the persons who under the garb
of Islam are ever after advancement of heresy.
