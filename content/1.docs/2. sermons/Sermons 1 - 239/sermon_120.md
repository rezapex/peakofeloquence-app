title: Sermon 120
description: This is sermon 120

Amir al-mu'minin collected the people and exhorted them(1) to jihad but they observed long
silence. Then he said: "What is the matter with you. Have you become dumb?" A group of
them replied: "O' Amir al-mu'minin if you go forth we shall be with you." Whereupon Amir
al-mu'minin said:
What has happened to you? You may not be guided aright or shown the right path. Should in
these circumstances I go forth? In fact, at this time one of the brave and the valorous among
you whom I select should go out. It does not suit me to leave the army, the city, the public
treasury, the land revenue, the dispensation of justice among Muslims and looking after the
demands of the claimants and to follow one contingent after the other moving here and there
like a featherless arrow moving in the quiver.
I am the axis of the mill. It rotates on me while I remain in my position. As soon as I leave it
the centre of its rotation would be disturbed and its lower stone would also be disturbed.
By Allah, this is a very bad advice. By Allah, if I had not been hoping for martyrdom by my
meeting with the enemy - and my meeting with him has been ordained, I would have secured
my carrier and went away from you and would not have sought you so long as North and
South differed.
There is no benefit in the majority of your numbers because of lack of unity of your hearts. I
have put you on the clear path whereon no one will perish except who perishes by himself. He
who sticks to it would achieve Paradise and he who deviates goes to Hell.
(1). When after the Battle of Siffin, Mu'awiyah's forces began to attack various places in Amir
al-mu'minin's area, he asked the Iraqis to check them but they declined on the plea that they
would follow him if he himself came forward. Thereupon he delivered this sermon, and clarified
his limitations, that if he himself went out it was impossible to run the affairs of the state, and
that the enemy's attacks had already started on all sides.
In these circumstances it was impolitic to keep the centre unguarded. But what could be hoped
from those who changed the victory at Siffin into defeat and opened the door for these
attacks.
