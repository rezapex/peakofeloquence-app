Seeking rain
O' my Allah! surely our mountains have dried up and our earth has become dusty. Our cattle
are thirsty and are bewildered in their enclosures. They are moaning like the moaning of
mothers for their (dead) sons. They are tired of going to their meadows and longing for their
watering places. O' my Allah! have mercy on the groan of the groaning and yearn of the
yearning. O' my Allah! have mercy on their bewilderment and their passages and their
groaning in their yards.
O' my Allah ! we have come out to Thee when the years of drought have crowded over us like
(a herd of) thin camels, and rain clouds have abandoned us. Thou art the hope for the afflicted
and succour for the seeker. We call Thee when the people have lost hopes, cloud has been
denied and cattle have died, that do not seize us for our deeds and do not catch us for our sins,
and spread Thy mercy over us through raining clouds, rain-fed blossoming, amazing
vegetation, and heavy down-pours with which all that was dead regains life and all that was
lost returns.
O' my Allah! give rain from Thee which should be life giving, satisfying, thorough, widescattered,
purified, blissful, plentiful and invigorating. Its vegetation should be exuberant, its
branches full of fruits and its leaves green. With it Thou reinvigorates the weak among Thy
creatures and bringeth back to life the dead among Thy cities.
O' my Allah! give rain from Thee with which our high lands get covered with green herbage,
streams get flowing, our sides grow green, our fruits thrive, our cattle prosper, our far-flung
areas get watered and our dry areas get its benefit, with Thy vast blessing and immeasurable
grant on Thy distressed universe and Thy untamed beasts.
And pour upon us rain which is drenching, continuous and heavy; wherein one cycle of rain
clashes with the other and one rain drop pushes another (into a continuous chain), its lightning
should not be deceptive, its cheek not rainless, its white clouds not scattered and rain not
light, so that the famine-stricken thrive with its abundant herbage and the drought stricken
come to life with its bliss. Certainly, Thou pourest down rain after the people lose hopes and
spreadest Thy mercy, since Thou art the Guardian, the praiseworthy.
As-Sayyid ar-Radi says: The wonderful expressions of this sermon: Amir al-mu'minin's
words "insahat jibaluna" means the mountains cracked on account of drought. It is said
"insaha'ththawbu" when it is torn. It is also said "insaha'n-nabtu" or "saha" or "sawwaha"
when vegetation withers and dries up.
His words "wa hamat dawabbuna" means became thirsty, as "huyam" means thirst.
His words "hadabiru's-sinin". This is plural of "hidbar". It means the camel whom treading
has made thin. So Amir al-mu'minin likened with such a camel the year in which drought had
occurred. The Arab poet Dhu ar-Rummah has said:
These thin camels remain in their places, facing hardships and move only when
we take them to some dry area.
His words "wa la qaza`in rababuha". Here "al-qaza" means small pieces of cloud scattered all
round.
His words "wa la shaffanin dhihabuha". It stands for "wa la dhata shaffanin dhihabuha". "ashshaffan"
means the cold wind and "adh-dhihab" means light rain. He omitted the world
"dhata" from here because of the listener's knowledge of it.
