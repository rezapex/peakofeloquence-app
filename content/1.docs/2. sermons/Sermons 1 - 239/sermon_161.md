Praise of Allah
Allah's verdict is judicious and full of wisdom. His pleasure implies protection and mercy. He
decides with knowledge and forgives with forbearance.
O' my Allah! Praise be to Thee for what Thou takest and givest and for that from which Thou
curest or with which Thou afflictest; praise which is the most acceptable to Thee, the most
like by Thee and the most dignified before Thee; praise which fills all Thy creation and
reaches where Thou desirest; praise which is not veiled from Thee and does not end, and
whose continuity does not cease.
Greatness of Allah
We do not know the reality of Thy greatness except that we know that thou art Ever-living
and Self-subsisting by Whom all things subsist. Drowsiness or sleep do not overtake Thee,
vision does not reach Thee and sight does not grasp Thee. Thou seest the eyes and countest
the ages. Thou holdest (people as slaves) by foreheads and feet.
We see Thy creation and wonder over it because of Thy might, and describe it as (a result of)
Thy great authority; whereas what is hidden from us, of which our sight has fallen short,
which our intelligence has not attained, and between which and ourselves curtains of the
unknown have been cast, is far greater.
He who frees his heart (from all other engagements) and exerts his thinking in order to know
how Thou established Thy throne, how Thou created Thy creatures, how Thou suspended the
air in Thy skies and how Thou spread Thy earth on the waves of water, his eyes would return
tired, his intelligence defeated, his ears eager and his thinking awander.
A part of the same sermon about hope and fear in Allah.
He claims according to his own thinking that he hopes from Allah. By Allah, the Great, he
speaks a lie. The position is that his hope (in Allah) does not appear through his action
although the hope of every one who hopes is known through his action.
Every hope is so, except the hope in Allah, the Sublime, if it is impure; and every fear is
established except the fear for Allah if it is unreal.
He hopes big things from Allah and small things from men but he gives to man (such
consideration as) he does not give to Allah. What is the matter with Allah, glorified be His
praise? He is accorded less (consideration) than what is given to His creatures. Do you ever
fear to be false in your hope in Allah? Or do you not regard Him the centre of your hope?
Similarly, if a man fears man he gives him (such consideration) out of his fear which he does
not give to Allah. Thus, he has made his fear for men ready currency while his fear from the
Creator is mere deferment or promise. This is the case of every one in whose eye this world
appears big (and important) and in whose heart its position is great. He prefers it over Allah,
so he inclines towards it, and becomes its devotee.
The example of the Holy Prophet
Certainly, in the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him and his progeny)
was sufficient example for you and a proof concerning the vices of the world, its defects, the
multitude of its disgraces and its evils, because its sides had been constrained for him, while
its flanks had been spread for others; he was deprived of its milk and turned away from its
adornments.
The example of Musa (Moses)
If you want, I will, as a second example, relate to you concerning Musa, the Interlocutor of
Allah (p.b.u.h.) when he said: O' Allah! I need whatever good Thou mayest grant me (Qur'an,
28:24). By Allah, he asked Him only for bread to eat because he was used to eating the herbs
of the earth, and the greenness of the herbs could be seen from the delicate skin of his belly
due to his thinness and paucity of his flesh.
The example of Dawud (David)
If you desire I can give you a third example of Dawud (p.b.u.h.). He is the holder of the
Psalms and the reciter among the people of Paradise. He used to prepare baskets of date palm
leaves with his own hands and would say to his companions: "Which of you will help me by
purchasing it?" He used to eat barley bread (bought) out of its price.
The example of `Isa (Jesus)
If you desire I will tell you about `Isa (p.b.u.h.) son of Maryam (Mary). He used a stone for
his pillow, put on coarse clothes and ate rough food. His condiment was hunger. His lamp at
night was the moon. His shade during the winter was just the expanse of earth eastward and
westward. His fruits and flowers were only what grows from the earth for the cattle.
He had no wife to allure him, nor any son to give grief, nor wealth to deviate (his attention),
nor greed to disgrace him. His two feet were his conveyance and his two hands his servant.
Following the example of the Holy Prophet
You should follow your Prophet, the pure, the chaste, may Allah bless him and his
descendants. In him is the example for the follower, and the consolation for the seeker of
consolation. The most beloved person before Allah is he who follows His Prophet and who
treads in his footsteps. He took the least (share) from this world and did not take a full glance
at it.
Of all the people of the world he was the least satiated and the most empty of stomach. The
world was offered to him but he refused to accept it. When he knew that Allah, the Glorified,
hated a thing, he too hated it; that Allah held a thing low, he too held it low; that Allah held a
thing small, he too held it small. If we love what Allah and His Prophet hate and hold great
what Allah and His prophet hold small that would be enough isolation from Allah and
transgression of His commands.
The Prophet used to eat on the ground, and sat like a slave. He repaired his shoe with his
hand, and patched his clothes with his hand. He would ride an unsaddled ass and would seat
someone behind him. If there was a curtain on his door with pictures on it he would say to
one of his wives. "O' such-and-such, take it away out of my sight because if I look at it I recall
the world and its allurements." Thus, he removed his heart from this world and destroyed its
remembrance from his mind.
He loved that its allurements should remain hidden from his eye so that he should not secure
good dress from it, should not regard it a place of stay and should not hope to live in it.
Consequently, he removed it from his mind, let it go away from his heart and kept it hidden
from his eyes. In the same way he who hates a thing should hate to look at it or to hear about
it.
Certainly there was in the Prophet of Allah all that would apprise you of the evils of this
world and its defects, namely that he remained hungry along with his chief companions, and
despite his great nearness the allurements of the world remained remote from him. Now, one
should see with one's intelligence whether Allah honoured Muhammad (the peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him and his descendants) as a result of this or disgraced him. If he
says that Allah disgraced him, he certainly lies and perpetrates a great untruth.
If he says Allah honoured him, he should know that Allah dishonoured the others when He
extended the (benefits of the) world for him but held them away from him who was the
nearest to Him of all men.
Therefore, one should follow His Prophet, tread in his footsteps and enter through his
entrance. Otherwise he will not be safe from ruin. Certainly, Allah made Muhammad (the
peace and blessing of Allah be upon him and his descendants) a sign for the Day of
Judgement. a conveyor of tidings for Paradise and a warner of retribution.
He left this world hungry but entered upon the next world safe. He did not lay one stone upon
another (to make a house) till he departed and responded to the call of Allah. How great is
Allah's blessing in that He blessed us with the Prophet as a predecessor whom we follow and
a leader behind whom we tread.
The example of himself
By Allah, I have been putting patches in my shirts so much that now I feel shy of the patcher.
Someone asked me whether I would not put it off, but I said, "Get away from me." Only in
the morning do people (realised the advantage of and) speak highly of the night journey.
