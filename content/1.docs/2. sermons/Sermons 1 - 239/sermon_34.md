About the disparagement of the world and categories of its people
O' people! we have been borne in such a wrongful and thankless period wherein the virtuous
is deemed vicious and the oppressor goes on advancing in his excess. We do not make use of
what we know and do not discover what we do not know. We do not fear calamity till it
befalls.
People are of four categories. Among them is one who is prevented from mischief only by his
low position, lack of means and paucity of wealth.
Then there is he who has drawn his sword, openly commits mischief, has collected his
horsemen and foot-men and has devoted himself to securing wealth, leading troops, rising on
the pulpit and has allowed his faith to perish. How bad is the transaction that you allow
(enjoyment of) this world to be a price for yourself as an alternative for what there is with
Allah for you.
And among them is he who seeks (benefits of) this world through actions meant for the next
world, but does not seek (good of) the next world through actions of this world. He keeps his
body calm (in dignity), raises small steps, holds up his clothes, embellishes his body for
appearance of trust-worthiness and uses the position of Allah's connivance as a means of
committing sins.
Then there is one whose weakness and lack of means have held him back from conquest of
lands. This keeps down his position and he has named it contentment and he clothes himself
with the robe of renunciation although he has never had any connection with these qualities.
Then there remain a few people in whose case the remembrance of their return (to Allah on
Doomsday) keeps their eyes bent, and the fear of resurrection moves their tears. Some of
them are scared away (from the world) and dispersed; some are frightened and subdued; some
are quiet as if muzzled; some are praying sincerely, some are grief-stricken and pain-ridden
whom fear has confined to namelessness and disgrace has shrouded them, so they are in (the
sea of) bitter water, their mouths are closed and their hearts are bruised. They preached till
they were tired, they were oppressed till they were disgraced and they were killed till they
remained few in number.
The world in your eyes should be smaller than the bark of acacia and the clippings of wool.
Seek instruction from those who preceded you before those who follow you take instruction
from you, and keep aloof from it realising its evil because it cuts off even from those who
were more attached to it than you.
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: Some ignorant persons attributed this sermon to Mu`awiyah but it is
the speech of Amir al-mu'minin. There should be no doubt about it. What comparison is there
between gold and clay or sweet and bitter water. This has been pointed out by the skilful
guide and the expert critic `Amr ibn Bahr al-Jahiz as he has mentioned this sermon in his
book, al-Bayan wa't-tabyin (vol. 2, pp. 59-61).
He has also mentioned who attributed it to Mu`awiyah and then states that it is most akin to
be the speech of `Ali and most in accord with his way of categorising people and information
about their oppression, disgrace, apprehension and fear. (On the other hand) we never found
Mu`awiyah speaking on the lives of renunciates or worshippers .
