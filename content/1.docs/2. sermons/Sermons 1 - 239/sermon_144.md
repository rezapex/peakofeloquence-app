Praying for rain
Beware; the earth which bears you and the sky which overshadows you are obedient to their
Sustainer (Allah).
They have not been bestowing their blessings on you for any feeling of pity on you or
inclination towards you, nor for any good which they expect from you, but they were
commanded to bestow benefits on you and they are obeying, and were asked to maintain your
good and so they are maintaining it.
Certainly, Allah tries his creatures in respect of their evil deeds by decreasing fruits, holding
back blessings and closing the treasures of good, so that he who wishes to repent may repent,
he who wishes to turn away (from evils) may turn away, he who wishes to recall (forgotten
good) may recall, and he who wishes to abstain (from evil) may abstain.
Allah, the Glorified, has made the seeking of (His) forgiveness a means for the pouring down
of livelihood and mercy on the people as Allah has said:
... Seek ye the forgiveness of your Lord! Verily, He is the Most-forgiving, He
will send (down) upon you the cloud raining in torrents, and help you with
wealth and sons (children) . . . (Qur'an, 17:10-12)
Allah may shower mercy on him who took up repentance, gave up sins and hastened (in
performing good acts before) his death.
O' my Allah! we have come out to Thee from under the curtains and coverings (of houses)
when the beasts and children are crying, seeking Thy Mercy, hoping for the generosity of Thy
bounty an fearing Thy chastisement and retribution. O' my Allah! give us to drink from Thy
rain and do not disappoint us, nor kill us by years (of drought) nor punish us for what the
foolish among us have committed, O' the Most Merciful of all.
O' my Allah! we have come out to Thee to complain to Thee who is (already) not hidden from
Thee, when the seven troubles have forced us, droughty famines have driven us, distressing
wants have made us helpless and troublesome mischiefs have incessantly befallen us.
O' my Allah! we beseech Thee not to send us back disappointed nor to return us with downcast
eyes, nor to address us (harshly) for our sins, nor deal with us according to our deeds.
O' my Allah! do pour on us Thy mercy, Thy blessing, Thy sustenance and Thy pity, and make
us enjoy a drink which benefits us, quenches our thirst, produces green herbage with which all
that was lost gets a growing and all that had withered comes to life again.
It should bring about the benefit of freshness and plentifulness of ripe fruits. With it plains
may be watered, rivers may begin flowing, plants may pick up foliage and prices may come
down. Surely, Thou art powerful over whatever Thou willest.
