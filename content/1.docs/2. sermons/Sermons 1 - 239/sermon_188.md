Regarding the vicissitudes of time
(The mischiefs that are to occur and the absence of lawful ways of
livelihood)
May my father and my mother be sacrificed for those few whose names are well-known in the
sky and not known on the earth. Beware, you should expect what is to befall you such as
adversity in your affairs, severance of relations and the rising up of inferior people.
This will happen when the blow of a sword will be easier for a believer than to secure one
Dirham lawfully. This will happen (1) when the reward of the beggar is more than that of the
giver.
This will be when you are intoxicated, not by drinking, but with wealth and plenty, you are
swearing without compulsion and are speaking lies without compulsion. This will be when
troubles hurt you as the saddle hurts the hump of the camel.
How long will these tribulations be and how distant the hope (for deliverance from them)?
O' people, throw away the reins of the horses who carry on their backs the weight of your
hands (i.e. sins), do not cut away from your chief (Imam) otherwise you will blame yourself
for your own doings. Do not jump in the fire which is in flames in front of you; keep away
from its courses and leave the middle way for it. Because, by my life, the believer will die in
its flames, and others will remain safe in it.
I am among you like a lamp in the darkness. Whoever enters by it will be lit from it. So listen
O' men, preserve it and remain attentive with the ears of your hearts so that you may
understand.
(1). In that period the reward of the beggar who takes will be higher than that of the giver
because the ways of earning livelihood of the rich will be unlawful, and whatever he will donate
of it, its purpose will be showing himself, hypocrisy and seeking fame, for which he will not be
entitled to any reward, while the poor who take it by force of their poverty and helplessness,
and to spend it in the right manner, will deserve more reward and recompense.
The commentator, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written another meaning of it also, namely if the beggar
does not take the wealth from the rich and it remains with him he will spend it on unlawful
matters and enjoyments, and since his taking it from him prevents him from using it in
unlawful manner; therefore, for this prevention of evil, the beggar will deserve more reward
and recompense. (Sharh Nahj al-balaghah, vol. 13, p. 97)
