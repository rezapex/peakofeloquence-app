About the sincerity of his own intention and support of the oppressed
Your allegiance to me was not without thinking,(1) nor is my and your position the same. I
seek you for Allah's sake but you seek me for your own benefits.
O' people! support me despite your heart's desires. By Allah, I will take revenge for the
oppressed from the oppressor and will put a string in the nose of the oppressor and drag him
to the spring of truthfulness even though he may grudge it.
(1). Here Amir almu'minin points to the view of `Umar ibn al-Khattab which he had on the
allegiance of Abu Bakr on the day of Saqifah when he said: " . . . let me clarify this to you that
the allegiance with Abu Bakr was a mistake and without thinking (faltah) but Allah saved us
from its evil.
Therefore, whoever (intends to) acts like this you must kill him. . ." (as-Sahih, al-Bukhari, vol.
