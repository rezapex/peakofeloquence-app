About the Holy Prophet and his Descendants
Praise be to Allah Who spreads His bounty throughout the creation, and extends His hand of
generosity among them. We praise Him in all His affairs and seek His assistance for
fulfilment of His rights.
We stand witness that there is no god except He and that Muhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.p. ) is His
slave and Prophet. He sent him to manifest His commands and speak about His remembrance.
Consequently, he fulfilled it with trustworthiness, and he passed away while on the right path.
He left among us the standard of right. Whoever goes further from it goes out of Faith,
whoever lags behind it is ruined. Whoever sticks to it would join (the right). Its guide is short
of speech, slow of steps, and quick when he rises. When you have bent your necks before him
and pointed towards him with your fingers his death would occur and would take him away.
They would live after him as long as Allah wills, till Allah brings out for you one who would
collect you together and fuse you after diffusion.
Do not place expectations in one who does not(1) come forward and do not lose hope in one
who is veiled, because it is possible that one of the two feet of the veiled one may slip while
the other may remain sticking, till both return to position and stick.
Beware! The example of the descendant (Al) of Muhammad - peace and blessing of Allah be
upon him and his descendants - is like that of stars in the sky. When one star sets another one
rises. So you are in a position that Allah's blessings on you have been perfected and He has
shown you what you used to wish for.
(1). The implication is that if for the time being your expectations are not being fulfilled, you
should not be disappointed.
It is possible matters may improve, the impediments in the way of improvement may be
removed and matters may be settled as you wish.
