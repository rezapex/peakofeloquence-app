About Allah's attributes
Praise be to Allah for Whom one condition does not proceed another so that He may be the
First before being the Last or He may be Manifest before being Hidden. Everyone called one
(alone) save Him is by virtue of being small (in number); and everyone enjoying honour other
than Him is humble.
Every powerful person other than Him is weak. Every master (owner) other than Him is slave
(owned).
Every knower other than Him is seeker of knowledge. Every controller other than Him is
sometimes imbued with control and sometimes with disability. Every listener other than Him
is deaf to light voices while loud voices make him deaf and distant voices also get away from
him. Every onlooker other than Him is blind to hidden colours and delicate bodies.
Every manifest thing other than Him is hidden, but every hidden thing other than Him is
incapable of becoming manifest.
He did not create what He created to fortify His authority nor for fear of the consequences of
time, nor to seek help against the attack of an equal or a boastful partner or a hateful
opponent. On the other hand all the creatures are reared by him and are His humbled slaves.
He is not conditioned in anything so that it be said that He exists therein, nor is He separated
from anything so as to be said that He is away from it. The creation of what He initiated or the
administration of what He controls did not fatigue Him.
No disability overtook Him against what He created. No misgiving ever occurred to Him in
what He ordained and resolved. But His verdict is certain, His knowledge is definite, His
governance is overwhelming. He is wished for at time of distress and He is feared even in
bounty.
