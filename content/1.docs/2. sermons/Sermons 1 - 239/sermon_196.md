Allah's praise, advice about fear of Allah and details about the Day of
Judgement
Praise be to Allah who has displayed such effects of His authority and the glory of His
sublimity through the wonders of His might that they dazzle the pupils of the eyes and
prevent the minds from appreciating the reality of His attributes. I stand witness that there is
no god but Allah by virtue of belief, certainty, sincerity and conviction.
I also stand witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Prophet whom He deputed when the
signs of guidance were obliterated and the ways of religion were desolate. So, he threw open
the truth, gave advice to the people, guided them towards righteousness and ordered them to
be moderate. May Allah bless him and his descendants.
Know, O' creatures of Allah, that He has not created you for nought and has not left you free.
He knows the extent of His favours over you and the quantity of His bounty towards you.
Therefore, ask Him for success and for the attainment of aims. Beg before Him and seek His
generosity. No curtain hides you from Him, nor is any door closed before you against Him.
He is at every place, in every moment and every instance. He is with every man and jinn.
Giving does not create any breach in Him. Gifting does not cause Him diminution. A beggar
cannot exhaust Him and paying (to others) cannot take Him to the end.
One person cannot turn His attention from another, one voice does not detract Him from
another voice, and one grant of favour does not prevent Him from refusing another favour.
Anger does not prevent Him from mercy, mercy does not prevent Him from punishing; His
concealment does not hide His manifestness and His manifestness does not prevent Him from
concealment. He is near and at the same time distant. He is high and at the same time low.
He is manifest and also concealed. He is concealed yet well-known. He lends but is not lent
anything. He has not created (the things of) creation after devising, nor did He take their
assistance on account of fatigue.
I advise you, O' creatures of Allah, to have fear of Allah, for it is the rein and the mainstay (of
religion). Hold fast to its salient points, keep hold of its realities. It will take you to abodes of
easiness, places of comfort, fortresses of safety and houses of honour on the Day (of
Judgement) when eyes will be wide open, (Qur'an, 14:42), when there will be darkness all
round, when small groups of camels pregnant for ten months will be allowed free grazing, and
when the Horn will be blown, then every living being will die, every voice will become dumb
the high mountains and hard rocks will crumble (to pieces) so that their hard stones will turn
into moving sand and their bases will become level. (On that day) there will be no interceder
to intercede and no relation to ward off (trouble), and no excuse will be of avail.
