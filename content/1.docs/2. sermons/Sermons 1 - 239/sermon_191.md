Importance of fear of Allah, desolateless of the grave, and about the
death of the lover of Ahlu'l-bayt being like that of a martyr
I praise Him out of gratefulness for His reward, and I seek His assistance in fulfilling His
rights. He has a strong army. His dignity is grand. I stand witness that Muhammad - peace
and blessing of Allah be upon him and his progeny - is His slave and His Prophet.
He called (people) to His obedience and overpowered His enemies by fighting for the sake of
His religion. People's joining together to falsify him and their attempt to extinguish His light
did not prevent him from it.
You should therefore exercise fear of Allah because it has a rope whose twist is strong and its
pinnacle is lofty and invulnerable. Hasten toward death in its pangs (by doing good acts) and
be prepared for it before its approach, because the ultimate end is the Day of Judgement.
This is enough preaching for one who understands and enough of a lesson for one who does
not know. What idea do you have, before reaching that end, of the narrowness of grave, the
hardship of loneliness, fear of the passage towards the next world, the pangs of fear, the
shifting of ribs here and there (due to narrowing of the grave), the deafness of ears, the
darkness of the grave, fear of the promised punishment, the closing of the receptacle of the
grave and the laying of stones?
Therefore, (fear) Allah, (fear) Allah, O' creatures of Allah, because the world is behaving with
you in the usual way and you and the Day of Judgement are in the same rope (close to each
other).
As though it has come with its signs, has approached with its pleas and has made you stand in
its way; and as though it has come forward with all its quakings and has settled down with its
chest on the ground while the world has parted from its people and has turned them out of its
lap.
It was like a day that has passed or a month that has gone by. Its new things have become old
and the fat ones have become thin.
They are in a narrow place, in very complicated affairs and in a fire whose pain is sharp, cries
are loud, flames are rising, sound is trembling, burning is severe, abatement is remote; its fuel
is burning, its threats are fearful, its hollows are hidden, its sides are dark, its vessels are
aflame, and everything about it is abominable.
And shall be conveyed those who feared (the wrath of) their Lord, in
companies unto the garden. . . (Qur'an. 39:73)
They are safe from chastisement, away from punishment, and kept aloof from fire. Their
abode will be peaceful and they will be pleased with their longing and their place of stay.
These are the people whose acts in this world were chaste, their eyes were tearful, their nights
in this world were like days because of fearing and seeking forgiveness, and their days were
like nights because of feeling of loneliness and separation.
Therefore, Allah made Paradise the place of their (eventual) return and a reward in
recompense.... They were most eligible and suitable for it;... (Qur'an, 48:26) in the eternal
domain and everlasting favours.
Therefore, O' creatures of Allah, pay regard to all that by being regardful of which one will
succeed and by ignoring which one will incur loss, and hasten towards your death by means
of your (good) acts, because you are bound by what you have done in the past and you have
to your credit only what (good acts) you have sent forward.
(Behave in such a way) as though the feared event (death) has come upon you, so that you
cannot return (to do good acts) nor can you be cleared of evil acts. Allah may prompt us and
you for His obedience and obedience of His Prophet, and forgive us and you by His great
mercy.
Stick to the earth, keep patient in trials, do not move your hands and swords after the liking of
your tongues, and do not make haste in matters in which Allah has not asked for haste
because any one of you who dies in his bed while he had knowledge of the rights of Allah and
the rights of His Prophet and members of the Prophet's house, will die as martyr.
His reward is incumbent on Allah. He is also eligible to the recompense of what good acts he
has intended to do, since his intention takes the place of drawing his sword. Certainly, for
every thing there is a time and a limit.
