About Talhah and az-Zubayr
By Allah, they did not find any disagreeable thing in me, nor did they do justice between me
and themselves. Surely, they are now demanding a right which they have abandoned and
blood which they have themselves shed.
If I partook in it with them then they too have a share in it, but if they committed it without
me the demand should be against them. The first step of their justice should be that they pass
verdict against themselves. I have my intelligence with me.
I have never mixed matters nor have they appeared mixed to me. Certainly, this is the
rebellious group in which there is the near one (az-Zubayr), the scorpion's venom (`A'ishah)
and doubts which cast a veil (on facts). But the matter is clear, and the wrong has been shaken
from its foundation.
Its tongue has stopped uttering mischief. By Allah, I will prepare for them a cistern from
which I alone will draw water. They will not be able to drink from it nor would they be able
to drink from any other place.
A part of the same sermon
You advanced towards me shouting "allegiance, allegiance" like shecamels having delivered
newly born young ones leaping towards their young. I held back my hand but you pulled it
towards you., I drew back my hand but you dragged it. O' my Allah! these two have ignored
my rights and did injustice to me. They both have broken allegiance to me, and roused people
against me. Unfasten Thou what they have fastened, and do not make strong what they have
woven.
Show them the evil in what they aimed at and acted upon.
Before fighting I asked them to be steadfast in allegiance and behaved with them with
consideration but they belittled the blessing and refused (to adopt the course of) safety.
