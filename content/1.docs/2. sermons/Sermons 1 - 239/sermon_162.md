Deputation of the Holy Prophet
Allah deputed the Prophet with a sparkling light, a clear argument, an open path and a guiding
book. His tribe is the best tribe and his lineal tree the best lineal tree whose branches are in
good proportion and fruits hanging (in plenty).
His birth-place was Mecca, and the place of his immigration Taybah (Medina), from where
his name rose high and his voice spread far and wide.
Allah sent him with a sufficing plea, a convincing discourse and a rectifying announcement.
Through him Allah disclosed the ways that had been forsaken, and destroyed the innovations
that had been introduced. Through him He explained the detailed commands.
Now, whoever adopts a religion other than Islam, his misery is definite, his stick (of support)
will be cracked, his fate will be serious, his end will be long grief and distressing punishment.
Drawing lessons from this world
I trust in Allah, the trust of bending towards Him, and I seek His guidance for the way that
leads to His Paradise and takes to the place of His pleasure.
I advise you, O' creatures of Allah, to exercise fear of Allah and to obey Him because it is
salvation tomorrow and deliverance for ever. He warned (you of chastisement) and did so
thoroughly.
He persuaded (you towards virtues) and did so fully. He described this world, its cutting away
from you, its decay and its shifting. Therefore, keep aloof from its attractions, because very
little of it will accompany you. This house is the closest to the displeasure of Allah and the
remotest from the pleasure of Allah.
So close your eyes, O' creatures of Allah, from its worries and engagements, because you are
sure about its separation and its changing conditions.
Fear it like a sincere fearer and one who struggles hard, and take a lesson from what you have
seen about the falling places of those before you, namely that their joints were made to
vanish, their eyes and ears were destroyed, their honour and prestige disappeared and their
pleasure and wealth came to an end. The nearness of their children changed into remoteness.
The company of their spouses changed into separation with them. They do not boast over
each other, nor do they beget children nor meet each other nor live as neighbours. Therefore,
fear O' creature of Allah, like the fear of one who has control over himself, who can check his
passions and perceive with his wisdom. Surely, the matter is quite clear, the banner is
standing, the course is level and the way is straight.
