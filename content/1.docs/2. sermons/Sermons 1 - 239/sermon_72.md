In condemnation of the people of Iraq
Now then, O ' people(1) of Iraq! You are like the pregnant woman who, on completion of the
period of pregnancy delivers a dead child and her husband is also dead and her period of
widowhood is long while only remote relation inherits her. By Allah, I did not come to you of
my own accord. I came to you by force of circumstances. I have come to know that you say
`Ali speaks lie. May Allah fight you! Against whom do I speak lie? Whether against Allah?
But I am the first to have believed in him.
Whether against His Prophet? But I am the first who testified to him. Certainly not. By Allah
it was a way of expression which you failed to appreciate, and you were not capable of it.
Woe to you. I am giving out these measures of nice expression free of any cost.
I wish there were vessels good enough to hold them.
Certainly, you will understand it after some time. (Qur'an, 38:88)
(1). When after Arbitration the Iraqis displayed lethargy and heartlessness in retaliating the
continuous attacks of Mu`awiyah, Amir al-mu'minin delivered this sermon abusing and
admonishing them. Herein he has referred to their being deceived at Siffin and has likened
them to a woman who has five qualities:
i)
Firstly, she is pregnant. This implies that these people had full capability to fight, and
were not like a barren woman from whom nothing is expected
ii)
Secondly, she has completed the period of pregnancy. That is they had passed over all
difficult stages and had approached near the final goal of victory.
iii)
Thirdly, she wilfully miscarries her child. That is after coming close to victory they came
down to settlement and instead of achieving the coveted goal faced disappointment.
iv)
Fourthly, her period of widowhood is long. That is they fell in such a state as though
they had no protector or patron and they were roaming about without any ruler.
v)
Fifthly, her successors would be distant persons. That is the people of Syria who had no
relationship with them would occupy their properties.
