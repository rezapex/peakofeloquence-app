About the excesses of the Quraysh
O' my Allah! I beseech Thee to take revenge on the Quraysh and those who are assisting
them, for they have cut asunder my kinship and over-turned my cup and have joined together
to contest a right to which I was entitled more than anyone else. They said to me: "If you get
your right, that will be just, but if you are denied the right, that too will be just.
Endure it with sadness or kill yourself in grief." I looked around but found no one to shield
me, protect me or help me except the members of my family. I refrained from flinging them
into death and therefore closed my eyes despite the dust, kept swallowing saliva despite (the
suffocation of) grief and endured pangs of anger although it was more bitter than colocynth
and more grievous than the bite of knives.
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: This utterance of Amir al-mu'minin hasalready appeared in an earlier
Sermon (171), but I have repeated it here because of the difference of versions.
A part of the same sermon about those whowent to Basrah to fight Amir al-mu'minin
They marched on my officers and the custodians of the public treasury which is still under my
control and on the people of a metropolis, all of whom were obedient to me and were in
allegiance to me.
They created division among them, instigated their party against me and attacked my
followers. They killed a group of them by treachery, while another group took up swords
against them and fought with the swords till they met Allah as adherents to truth.
