About Umayyads
The Banu Umayyah (Umayyads) are allowing me the inheritance of Muhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.
p.) bit (by bit). By Allah, if I live I would throw them away as the butcher removes the dust
from the dust-covered piece of flesh.
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: In one version for "al-widhamu't-taribah" (dust covered piece of
flesh) the words "at-turabu'l-wadhimah" (the soil sticking on a piece of flesh) have been
shown. That is, for the adjective the qualified noun and for the qualified noun the adjective
has been placed.
Any by the word "layufawwiqunani" Amir al-mu'minin implies that they allow him bit by bit
just as a she-camel may be milked a little and then its young one may be made to suck milk so
that it may be ready to be milked. And "al-widham" is the plural of "wadhamah" which means
the piece of stomach or of liver which falls on the ground and then the dust is removed from
it.
