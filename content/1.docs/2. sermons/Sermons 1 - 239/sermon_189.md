Allah's favours
I advise you, O' people, to fear Allah and to praise Him profusely for His favours to you and
His reward for you and His obligations on you. See how He chose you for favours and dealt
with you with mercy. You sinned openly; He kept you covered. You behaved in a way to
incur His punishment, but He gave you more time.
Condition of persons facing death
I also advise you to remember death and to lessen your heedlessness towards it. Why should
you be heedless of Him Who is not heedless of you? Why expect from him (i.e., the angel of
death) who will not give you time? The dead whom you have been watching suffice as
preachers.
They were carried to their graves, not riding themselves, and were placed in them but not of
their own accord. It seems as if they never lived in this world and as if the next world had
always been their abode. They have made lonely the place where they were living, and are
now living where they used to feel lonely.
They remained busy about what they had to leave, and did not care for where they were to go.
Now they cannot remove themselves from&127; evil, nor add to their virtues They were
attached to the world and it deceived them. They trusted it and it overturned them.
Transience of this world
May Allah have pity on you. You should therefore hasten towards (the preparation of) houses
which you have been commanded to populate, and towards which you have been called and
invited. Seek the completion of Allah's favours on you by exercising endurance in His
obedience and abstention from His disobedience, because tomorrow is close to today.
How fast are the hours of the day, how fast are the days in the month, how fast are the months
in the years and how fast the years in a life.
