About the greatness and the attributes of Allah (1)
Praise be to Allah who is proof of His existence through His creation, of His being external
through the newness of His creation, and through their mutual similarities of the fact that
nothing is similar to Him. Senses cannot touch Him and curtains cannot veil Him, because of
the difference between the Maker and the made, the Limiter and the limited and the Sustainer
and the sustained.
He is One but not by the first in counting, is Creator but not through activity or labour, is
Hearer but not by means of any physical organ, is Looker but not by a stretching of eyelids, is
Witness but not by nearness, is Distinct but not by measurement of distance, is Manifest but
not by seeing and is Hidden but not by subtlety (of body).
He is Distinct from things because He overpowers them and exercises might over them, while
things are distinct from Him because of their subjugation to Him and their turning towards
Him.
He who describes Him limits Him. He who limits Him numbers Him. He who numbers Him
rejects His eternity. He who said "how" sought a description for Him.
He who said "where" bounded him. He is the Knower even though there be nothing to be
known. He is the Sustainer even though there be nothing to be sustained. He is the Powerful
even though there be nothing to be overpowered.
A part of the same sermon about the Divine leaders (Imams)
The riser has risen, the sparkler has sparkled, the appearer has appeared and the curved has
been straightened. Allah has replaced one people with another and one day with another.
We awaited these changes as the famine-stricken await the rain. Certainly the Imams are the
vicegerents of Allah over His creatures and they make the creatures know Allah. No one will
enter Paradise except he who knows them and knows Him, and no one will enter Hell except
he who denies them and denies Him.
Allah the Glorified, has distinguished you with Islam and has chosen you for it. This is
because it is the name of safety and the collection of honour. Allah the Glorified, chose its
way and disclosed its pleas through open knowledge and secret maxims.
Its (Qur'an)wonders are not exhausted and its delicacies do not end. It contains blossoming
bounties and lamps of darkness. (The doors of) virtues cannot be opened save with its keys,
nor can gloom be dispelled save with its lamps. Allah has protected its inaccessible points
(from enemies) and allowed grazing (to its followers) in its pastures. It contains cover (from
the ailment of misguidance) for the seeker of cure and full support for the seeker of support.
(1). The first part of this sermon consists of important issues concerning the science of
knowledge about Allah, wherein Amir al-mu'minin has thrown light on the matter that Allah is
from ever and His attributes are the same as He Himself. When we cast a glance at creation,
we see that for every movement there is a mover, from which every man of ordinary wisdom is
compelled to conclude that no effect can appear without a cause, so much so, that even an
infant a few days old, when his body is touched, feels in the depth of his consciousness that
someone has touched him.
He indicates it by opening his eyes or turning and looking. How then can the creation of the
world and the system of all creation be arranged without a Creator or Organiser?
Once it is necessary to believe in a Creator, then He should exist by Himself, because
everything which has a beginning must have a centre of existence from which it should
terminate.
If that too needed a creator, there would be the question of whether this creator is also the
creation of some other creator or exists by itself. Thus unless a Self-created Creator is believed
in, who should be the cause of all causes, the mind will remain groping in the unending
labyrinth of cause and effect, and never attain the idea of the last extremity of the series of
creation. It would fall into the fallacy of circular arguing and would not reach any end.
If the creator were taken to have created himself, then there would be (one of the two
positions, namely) either he should be non-existent or existent.
If he were not existent, then it would not be possible for something non-existent to create any
existent being. If he were existent before creating himself, there would be no sense in coming
into being again. Therefore it is necessary to believe that the Creator should be a Being not
dependent on any other creator for His own existence, and everything else should be
dependent on Him.
This dependence of the entire creation is a proof that the existence of the Source of all
creation is from ever and eternal. And since all beings other than He are subject to change, are
dependent on position and place and are similar to one another in qualities and properties, and
since similarity leads to plurality whereas unity has no like save itself, therefore nothing can be
like Him.
Even things called one cannot be reckoned after His Unity because He is One and Singular in
every respect. He is free and pure from all those attributes which are found in body or matter
because He is neither body, nor colour, nor shape, nor does He lie in any direction, nor is He
bounded within some place or locality. Therefore, man cannot see or understand Him through
his senses or feelings, because senses can know only those things which accord with the
limitations of time, place and matter. To believe that He can be seen is to believe that He has
body, but since He is not a body, and He does not exist through a body, and He does not lie in
any direction or place, there is no question of His being seen.
But His being unseen is not like that of subtle material bodies, due to whose delicacy the eye
pierces through them and eyes remain unable to see them; as for example the wind in the vast
firmament. But He is unseen by His very existence.
Nevertheless, nothing is unseen for Him. He sees as well as hears, but is not dependent on
instruments of seeing or hearing, because if He were in need of organs of the body for hearing
and seeing He would be in need of external things for His perfection and would not be a
perfect Being, whereas He should be perfect in all respects and no attribute of perfection
should be apart from His Self.
To believe in attributes separately from His Self would mean that there would be a self and a
few attributes and the compound of the self and the attributes would be Allah. But a thing
which is compounded is dependent on its parts and these parts must exist before their
composition into the whole. When the parts exist from before, how can the whole be from ever
and eternal because its existence is later than that of its parts.
But Allah had the attributes of knowledge, power and sustaining even when nothing was
existent, because none of His attributes were created in Him from outside, but His attributes
are His Self and His Self is His attributes. Consequently, His knowledge does not depend on the
object of knowledge existing first and then His knowledge, because His Self is prior to things
coming into existence.
Nor is it necessary for His power that there should first exist the object to be over-powered and
then alone He would be called Powerful, because Powerful is that who has power equally for
doing or abandoning and as such the existence of the object to be over-powered is not
necessary.
Similarly Sustainer means master. Just as He is the Master of the non-existent after its coming
into existence, in the same way He has power to bring it into existence from non-existence,
namely if He so wills He may bestow existence upon it.
