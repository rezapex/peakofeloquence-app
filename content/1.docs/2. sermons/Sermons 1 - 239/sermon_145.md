Deputation of Prophets
Allah deputed prophets and distinguished them with His revelation. He made them as pleas
for Him among His creation, so that there should not remain any excuse for people. He
invited people to the right path through a truthful tongue.
You should know that Allah fully knows creation. Not that He was not aware of what they
concealed from among their hidden secrets and inner feelings, but in order to try them as to
whom from among them performs good acts, so that there is reward in respect of good acts
and chastisement in respect of evil acts.
The position of Ahlu'l-bayt (the Household of the Holy Prophet)
Where are those who falsely and unjustly claimed that they are deeply versed in knowledge,
as against us, although Allah raised us in position and kept them down, bestowed upon us
knowledge but deprived them, and entered us (in the fortress of knowledge) but kept them out.
With us guidance is to be sought and blindness (of misguidance) is to be changed into
brightness. Surely Imams (divine leaders) will be from the Quraysh. They have been planted
in this line through Hashim. It would not suit others nor would others be suitable as heads of
affairs.
A part of the same sermon about those who are against the Ahlu'l-bayt
They have adopted this world and abandoned the next world; left clean water and drunk
stinking water. I can almost see their wicked one (1) who committed unlawful acts, associated
himself with them, befriended them and accorded with them till his hair grew grey and his
nature acquired their tinge. He proceeded onward emitting foam like a torrential stream not
caring whom he drowned, or, like fire in straw, without realising what he burnt.
Where are the minds which seek light from the lamps of guidance, and the eyes which look at
minarets of piety? Where are the hearts dedicated to Allah, and devoted to the obedience of
Allah? They are all crowding towards worldly vanities and quarrelling over unlawful issues.
The ensigns of Paradise and Hell have been raised for them but they have turned their faces
away from Paradise and proceeded to Hell by dint of their performances.
Allah called them but they showed dislike and ran away. When Satan called them they
responded and proceeded (towards him).
(1). Here the reference is to `Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan who committed extreme atrocities
through his officer al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath-Thaqafi.
