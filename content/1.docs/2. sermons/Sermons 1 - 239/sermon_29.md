Exhorting people for jihad
Now then, surely jihad is one of the doors of Paradise, which Allah has opened for His chief
friends. It is the dress of piety and the protective armour of Allah and His trustworthy shield.
Whoever abandons it Allah covers him with the dress of disgrace and the clothes of distress.
He is kicked with contempt and scorn, and his heart is veiled with screens (of neglect). Truth
is taken away from him because of missing jihad. He has to suffer ignominy and justice is
denied to him.
Beware! I called you (insistently) to fight these people night and day, secretly and openly and
exhorted you to attack them before they attacked you, because by Allah, no people have been
attacked in the hearts of their houses but they suffered disgrace; but you put it off to others
and forsook it till destruction befell you and your cities were occupied.
The horsemen of Banu Ghamid(1) have reached al-Anbar and killed Hassan ibn Hassan al-
Bakri. They have removed your horsemen from the garrison.
I have come to know that every one of them entered upon Muslim women and other women
under protection of Islam and took away their ornaments from legs, arms, necks and ears and
no woman could resist it except by pronouncing the verse, "We are for Allah and to Him we
shall return." (Qur'an, 2 :156) Then they got back laden with wealth without any wound or
loss of life.
If any Muslim dies of grief after all this he is not to be blamed but rather there is justification
for him before me.
How strange! How strange! By Allah my heart sinks to see the unity of these people on their
wrong and your dispersion from your right. Woe and grief befall you. You have become the
target at which arrows are shot. You are being killed and you do not kill. You are being
attacked but you do not attack. Allah is being disobeyed and you remain agreeable to it. When
I ask you to move against them in summer you say it is hot weather. Spare us till heat
subsides from us. When I order you to march in winter you say it is severely cold; give us
time till cold clears from us. These are just excuses for evading heat and cold because if you
run away from heat and cold, you would be, by Allah, running away (in a greater degree)
from sword (war).
O' you semblance of men, not men, your intelligence is that of children and your wit is that of
the occupants of the curtained canopies (women kept in seclusion from the outside world). I
wish I had not seen you nor known you. By Allah, this acquaintance has brought about shame
and resulted in repentance. May Allah fight you! You have filled my heart with pus and
loaded my bosom with rage. You made me drink mouthful of grief one after the other.
You shattered my counsel by disobeying and leaving me so much so that Quraysh started
saying that the son of Abi Talib is brave but does not know (tactics of) war. Allah bless
them ! Is any one of them more fierce in war and more older in it than I am? I rose for it
although yet within twenties, and here I am, have crossed over sixty, but one who is not
obeyed can have no opinion.
(1). After the battle of Siffin, Mu`awiyah had spread killing and bloodshed all round, and
started encroachments on cities within Amir al-mu'minin's domain. In this connection he
deputised Sufyan ibn `Awf al-Ghamidi with a force of six thousand to attack Hit, al-Anbar and
al-Mada'in. First he reached al-Mada'in but finding it deserted proceeded to al-Anbar.
Here a contingent of five hundred soldiers was posted as guard from Amir al-mu'minin's side,
but it could not resist the fierce army of Mu`awiyah. Only a hundred men stuck to their
position and they did face them stoutly as far as they could but collecting together the enemy's
force made such a severe attack that they too could no more resist and the chief of the
contingent Hassan ibn Hassan al-Bakri was killed along with thirty others. When the battlefield
was clear the enemy ransacked al-Anbar with full freedom and left the city completely
destroyed.
When Amir al-mu'minin got the news of this attack he ascended the pulpit, and exhorted the
people for crushing the enemy and called them to jihad, but from no quarter was there any
voice or response. He alighted from the pulpit utterly disgusted and worried and in the same
condition set off for the enemy on foot. When people observed this their sense of self respect
and shame was also awakened and they too followed him.
Amir al-mu'minin stopped at an-Nukhaylah. People then surrounded and insisted upon him to
get back as they were enough with the enemy. When their insistence increased beyond
reckoning, Amir al-mu'minin consented to return and Sa`id ibn Qays al-Hamdani proceeded
forward with a force of eight thousand.
But Sufyan ibn `Awf al-Ghamidi had gone, so Sa`id came back without any encounter. When
Sa`id reached Kufah then - according to the version of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid - Amir al-mu'minin was
so deeply grieved and indisposed during those days to an extent of not wishing to enter the
mosque, but instead sat in the corridor of his residence (that connects the entrance of the
mosque) and wrote this sermon and gave it to his slave Sa`d to read it over to the people. But
al-Mubarrad (al-Kamil, vol. 1, pp.
104-107) has related from `Ubaydullah ibn Hafs al-Taymi, Ibn `A'ishah, that Amir al-mu'minin
delivered this sermon on a high pace in an-Nukhaylah. Ibn Maytham has held this view
preferable.
