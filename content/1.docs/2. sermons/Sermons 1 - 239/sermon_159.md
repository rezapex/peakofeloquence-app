About the Holy Prophet and the Holy Qur'an
Allah deputed the Prophet at a time when there had been no prophets for some time. People
had been in slumber for a long time and the twist of the rope had loosened. The Prophet came
with (a Book containing) testification to what (books) were already there and also with a light
to be followed.
It is the Qur'an. If you ask it to speak it won't do so; but I will tell you about it. Know that it
contains knowledge of what is to come about, stories of the past, cure for your ills and
regulation for whatever faces you.

About the autocracy of the Umayyads
At that time there will remain no house or tent but oppressors would inflict it with grief and
inject sickness in it. On that day no one in the sky will listen to their excuse and no one on the
earth will come to their help. You selected for the governance (caliphate) one who is not fit
for it, and you raised him to a position which was not meant for him.
Shortly Allah will take revenge from every one who has oppressed, food for food and drink
for drink, namely (they will be given) colocynth for eating, myrrh and aloes for drinking, and
fear for an inner and the sword for an outer covering.
They are nothing but carrier-beasts laden with sins and camels laden with evil deeds. I swear
and again swear that the Umayyads will have to spit out the caliphate as phlegm is spat and
thereafter they will never taste it nor relish its flavour so long as day and night rotate.
