Supplication
O' my Allah! Thou art the most attached to Thy lovers and the most ready to assist those who
trust in Thee. Thou seest them in their concealments, knowest whatever is in their
consciences, and art aware of the extent of their intelligence.
Consequently, their secrets are open to Thee and their hearts are eager from Thee. If
loneliness bores them, Thy remembrance gives them solace. If distresses befall them, they
beseech Thy protection, because they know that the reins of affairs are in Thy hands, and that
their movements depend upon Thy commands .
O' my Allah! if I am unable to express my request or cannot see my needs, then guide me
towards my betterment and take my betterment and take my heart towards the correct goal.
This is not against (the mode of) Thy guidance nor anything new against Thy ways of
support.
O' my Allah! deal with me through Thy forgiveness and do not deal with me according to Thy
justice.
