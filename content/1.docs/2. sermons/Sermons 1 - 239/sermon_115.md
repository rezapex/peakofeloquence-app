About abstemiousness, fear of Allah and importance of providing for
the next life
Praise be to Him Who makes praise followed by bounty and bounty with gratefulness. We
praise Him on His bounties as on His trials. We seek His help against these hearts which are
slow to obey what they have been commended but quick towards what they have been
desisted from.
We seek His forgiveness from that which His knowledge covers and His document preserves
- knowledge which does not leave anything and a document which does not omit anything.
We believe in Him like the belief of one who has seen the unknown and has attained the
promised rewards - belief, the purity whereof keeps off from belief in partners of Allah, and
whose conviction removes doubt.
We stand witness that there is no god but Allah, the One, Who has no partner for Him, and
that Muhammad is His slave and His Prophet, Allah may bless him and his descendants.
These two testimonies heighten the utterance and raise the act. The scale wherein they would
be placed would not be light while the scale from which they are removed would not become
heavy.
Enjoining people to Piety
O' creatures of Allah! I advise you to have fear of Allah which is the provision (for the next
world) and with it is (your) return. The provision would take you (to your destination) and the
return would be successful. The best one, who is able to make people listen has called
towards it and the best listener has listened to it. So the caller has proclaimed and the listener
has listened and preserved.
O' creations of Allah! certainly fear of Allah has saved the lovers of Allah from unlawful
items and gave His dread to their hearts till their nights are passed in wakefulness and their
noons in thirst. So they achieve comfort through trouble and copious watering through thirst.
They regarded death to be near and therefore hastened towards (good) actions. They rejected
their desires and so they kept death in their sight.
Then, this world is a place of destruction, tribulations, changes and lessons. As for
destruction, the time has its bow pressed (to readiness) and its dart does not go amiss, its
wound does not heal; it afflicts the living with death, the healthy with ailment and the safe
with distress.
It is an eater who is not satisfied and a drinker whose thirst is never quenched. As for
tribulation, a man collects what he does not eat and builds wherein he does not live. Then he
goes out to Allah without carrying the wealth or shifting the building.
As for its changes, you see a pitiable man becoming enviable and an enviable man becoming
pitiable. This is because the wealth has gone and misfortune has come to him.
As for its lessons, a man reaches near (realisation of) his desires when (suddenly) the
approach of his death cuts them; then neither the desire is achieved nor the desirer spared.
Glory to Allah, how deceitful are its pleasures, how thirst-rousing its quenching and how
sunny its shade.
That which approaches (i.e. death) cannot be sent back, he who goes away does not return.
Glory to Allah, how near is the living to the dead because he will meet him soon and how far
is the dead from the living because he has gone away from him.
Certainly nothing is viler than evil except its punishment, and nothing is better than good
except its reward. In this world everything that is heard is better than what is seen, while of
everything of the next world that is seen is better than what is heard.
So you should satisfy yourself by hearing rather than seeing and by the news of the unknown.
You should know that what is little in this world but much in the next is better than what is
much in this world but little in the next. In how many cases little is profitable while much
causes loss.
Certainly that which you have been commanded to do is wider than what you have been
refrained from, and what has been made lawful for you is more than what has been
prohibited. Then give up what is less for what is much, and what is limited for what is vast.
Allah has guaranteed your livelihood and has commanded you to act. Therefore, the pursuit of
that which has been guaranteed to you should not get preference over that whose performance
has been enjoined upon you.
But by Allah, most certainly the position is that doubt has overtaken and certainty has been
shattered and it seems as if what has been guaranteed to you is obligatory on you and what
was made obligatory on you has been taken away from you. So, hasten towards (good)
actions and dread the suddenness of death, because the return of age cannot be hoped for, as
the return of livelihood can be hoped for.
Whatever is missed from livelihood today may be hoped tomorrow with increase, but
whatever is lost from the age yesterday, its return cannot be expected today.
Hope can be only for that which is to come, while about that which is passed there is only
disappointment. So "fear Allah as He ought to be feared and do not die until you are (true)
Muslim." (Qur'an , 3:102)
