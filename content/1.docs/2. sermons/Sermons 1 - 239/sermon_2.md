Delivered on return from Siffin
Arabia before proclamation of Prophethood
I praise Allah seeking completion of His Blessing, submitting to His Glory and expecting
safety from committing His sins. I invoke His help being in need of His Sufficiency (of
protection).
He whom He guides does not get astray, He with whom He is hostile gets no protection. He
whom He supports does not remain needy. Praise is most weighty of all that is weighed and
the most valuable of all that is treasured.
I stand witness that there is no god but Allah the One. He has no like. My testimony has been
tested in its frankness, and its essence is our belief. We shall cling to it for ever till we live
and shall store it facing the tribulations that overtake us because it is the foundation stone of
Belief (iman) and the first step towards good actions and Divine pleasure. It is the means to
keep Satan away.
I also stand witness that Muhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.p.) is His slave and His Prophet. Allah sent
him with the illustrious religion, effective emblem, written Book,(1) effulgent light, sparkling
gleam and decisive injunction in order to dispel doubts, present clear proofs, administer
warning through signs and to warn of punishments. At that time people had fallen in vices
whereby the rope of religion had been broken, the pillars of belief had been shaken, principles
had been sacrileged, system had become topsy turvy, openings were narrow, passage was
dark, guidance was unknown and darkness prevailed.
Allah was being disobeyed, Satan was given support and Belief had been forsaken. As a result
the pillars of religion fell down, its traces could not be discerned, its passages had been
destroyed and its streets had fallen into decay. People obeyed Satan and treaded his paths.
They sought water from his watering places. Through them Satan's emblems got flying and
his standard was raised in vices which trampled the people under their hoofs, and treaded
upon them with their feet. The vices stood on their toes (in full stature) and the people
immersed in them were strayed, perplexed, ignorant and seduced as though in a good house
(2) with bad neighbours. Instead of sleep they had wakefulness and for antimony they had
tears in the eyes. They were in a land where the learned were in bridle (keeping their mouths
shut) while the ignorant were honoured.
In the same sermon Amir al-mu'minin referred to Al an-Nabi (the Household of the Holy
Prophet) as under:
They are the trustees of His secrets, shelter for His affairs, source of knowledge about Him,
centre of His wisdom, valleys for His books and mountains of His religion. With them Allah
straightened the bend of religion's back and removed the trembling of its limbs.
In the same Sermon he spoke about the hypocrites
They sowed vices, watered them with deception and harvested destruction.
(Alu Muhammad)
None in the Islamic community can be taken at par with the Progeny(3) of the Prophet (Alu
Muhammad). One who was under their obligation cannot be matched with them. They are the
foundation of religion and pillar of Belief.
The forward runner has to turn back to them while the follower has to overtake them. They
possess the chief characteristics for vicegerency. In their favour exists the will and succession
(of the Prophet). This is the time when right has returned to its owner and diverted to its
centre of return.
(1). The Preserved Record.
(2). Good House means 'Mecca' while the bad neighbours mean the 'Unbelievers of Quraysh.'
(3). About the Progeny of the Prophet Amir al-mu'minin has said that no person in the world
can be brought at par with them, nor can any one be deemed their equal in sublimity, because
the world is overladen with their obligations and has been able to secure eternal blessings only
through their guidance. They are the corner stone and foundation of religion and the
sustenance for its life and survival.
They are such strong pillars of knowledge and belief that they can turn away the stormy flow
of doubt and suspicion. They are such middle course among the paths of excess and
backwardness that if some one goes far towards excess and exaggeration or falls behind then
unless he comes back or steps forward to that middle course he cannot be on the path of
Islam.
They possess all the characteristics which give the superiority in the right for vicegerency and
leadership. Consequently, no one else in the ummah enjoys the right of patronage and
guardianship. That is why the Prophet declared them his vicegerents and successors. About will
and succession the commentator Ibn Abi'l-Hadid Mu`tazili writes that there can be no doubt
about the vicegerency of Amir al-mu'minin but succession cannot imply succession in position
although the Shi`ite sect has so interpreted it.
It rather implies succession of learning. Now, if according to him succession is taken to imply
succession in learning even he does not seem to succeed in achieving his object, because even
by this interpretation the right of succeeding the Prophet does not devolve on any other
person. When it is agreed that learning is the most essential requirement of khilafah (caliphate)
because the most important functions of the Prophet's Caliph consist of dispensation of justice,
solving problems of religious laws, clarifying intricacies and administration of religious
penalties. If these functions are taken away from the Prophet's deputy his position will come
down to that of a worldly ruler.
He cannot be regarded as the pivot of religious authority. Therefore either we should keep
governmental authority separate from Prophet's vicegerency or accept the successor of
Prophet's knowledge to suit that position. The interpretation of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid could be
acceptable if Amir al-mu'minin had uttered this sentence alone, but observing that it was
uttered soon after `Ali's (p.b.u.h.) recognition as Caliph and just after it the sentence "Right
has returned to its owner" exists, this interpretation of his seems baseless. Rather, the
Prophet's will cannot imply any other will except that for vicegerency and caliphate, and
succession would imply not succession in property nor in knowledge because this was not an
occasion to mention it here but it must mean the succession in the right leadership which stood
proved as from Allah not only on the ground of kinship but on the ground of qualities of
perfection.
