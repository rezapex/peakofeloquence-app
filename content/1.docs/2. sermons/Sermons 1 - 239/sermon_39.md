Amir al-mu'minin's utterance which runs like a Sermon
About his own steadfastness in religion and precedence in (acceptance of) belief.
I discharged duties when others lost courage (to do so), and I came forward when others hid
themselves. I spoke when others remained mum. I stroke with Divine light when others
remained standing. I was the quietest of them in voice but the highest in going forward. I
cleaved to its rein and applied myself solely to its pledge, like the mountain which neither
sweeping wind could move nor storm could shake. No one could find fault with me nor could
any speaker speak ill of me.
The low is in my view worthy of honour till I secure (his) right for him while the strong is in
my view weak till I take (other's) right from him. We are happy with the destiny ordained by
Allah and have submitted to the command of Allah. Do you think I would speak lie about the
Prophet of Allah? By Allah, I am surely the first to testify him, so I will not be the first to
falsify him. I looked at my affairs and found that my obedience should have precedence over
my allegiance while my pledge with him is a burden on my neck.
