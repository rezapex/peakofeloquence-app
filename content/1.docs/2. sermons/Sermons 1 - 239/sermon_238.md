About the two arbitrators (Abu Musa al-Ash`ari and `Amr ibn al-`As)
and disparagement of the people of Syria (ash-Sham).
Rude, low people and mean slaves. They have been collected from all sides and picked up
from every pack. They need to be taught the tenets (of Islam), disciplined, instructed, trained,
supervised and led by the hand.
They are neither muhajirun (immigrants from Mecca), nor ansar (helpers of Medina) nor
those who made their dwellings in the abode (in Medina) and in belief.
Look! They have chosen for themselves one who is nearest of all of them to what they desire,
while you have chosen one who is nearest to what you dislike. You may certainly recall that
the other day `Abdullah ibn Qays (Abu Musa) was saying: "It is a mischief, therefore, cut
away your bow-string and sheathe your swords." If he was right (in what he said) then he was
wrong in marching (with us) without being forced, but if he was lying then he should be
viewed with suspicion.
Therefore, send `Abdullah ibn al-`Abbas to face `Amr ibn al-`As. Make use of these days and
surround the borders of Islam. Do you not see that your cities are being attacked and your
prowess is being aimed at?
