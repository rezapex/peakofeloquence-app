About the Angel of Death and depart of spirit
Do you feel when the Angel of Death enters a house, or do you see him when he takes out life
of anyone? How does he take out the life of an embryo in the womb of his mother? Does he
reach it through any part of her body or the spirit responded to his call with the permission of
Allah? Or does he stay with him in the mother's interior? How can he who is unable to
describe a creature like this, describe Allah?
