About preaching and counselling
Allah may bless him who listens to a point of wisdom and retains it, when he is invited to the
right path he approaches it, he follows a leader (by catching his waist band) and finds
salvation, keeps Allah before his eyes and fears his sins, performs actions sincerely and acts
virtuously, earns treasure of heavenly rewards, avoids vice, aims at (good) objectives and
reaps recompense, faces his desires and rejects (fake) hopes, makes endurance the means to
his salvation and piety the provision for his death, rides on the path of honour and sticks to the
highway of truth, makes good use of his time and hastens towards the end and takes with him
the provision of (good) actions.
