About the two arbiters (after the battle of Siffin)
Your party had decided to select two persons, and so we took their pledge that they would act
according to the Qur'an and would not commit excess, that their tongues should be with it and
that their hearts should follow it. But they deviated from it, abandoned what was right
although they had it before their eyes.
Wrong-doing was their desire, and going astray was their behaviour. Although we had settled
with them to decide with justice.
to act according to the light and without the interference of their evil views and wrong
judgement. Now that they have abandoned the course of right and have come out with just the
opposite of what was settled, we have strong ground (to reject their verdict).
