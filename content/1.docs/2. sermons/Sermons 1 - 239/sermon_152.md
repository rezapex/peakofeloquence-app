The condition of the people during disorder, and advice against
oppression and unlawful earning
I praise Allah and seek His help from (what led to the) punishment of Satan and his deceitful
acts, and (l seek His) protection from Satan's traps and waylayings. I stand witness that there
is no god but Allah and I stand witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Prophet (peace
be upon him and his progeny) and his chosen and his selected one.
Muhammad's (p.b.u.h.a.h.p.) distinction cannot be paralleled nor can his loss be made good.
Populated places were brightened through him when previously there was dark misguidance,
overpowering ignorance and rude habits, and people regarded unlawful as lawful, humiliated
the man of wisdom, passed lives when there were no prophets and died as unbelievers.
You, O' people of Arabia, will be victims of calamities which have come near. You should
avoid the intoxication of wealth, fear the disasters of chastisement, keep steadfast in the
darkness and crookedness of mischief when its hidden nature discloses itself, its secrets
become manifest and its axis and the pivot of its rotation gain strength.
It begins in imperceptible stages but develops into great hideousness. Its youth is like the
youth of an adolescent and its marks are like the marks of beating by stone.
Oppressors inherit it by (mutual) agreement. The first of them serves as a leader for the latter
one and the latter one follows the first one. They vie with each other in (the matter of) this
lowly world, and leap over this stinking carcass. Shortly the follower will denounce his
connection with the leader, and the leader with the follower.
They will disunite on account of mutual and curse one another when they meet. Then after
this there will appear another arouser of mischief who will destroy ruined things. The heart
will become wavering after being normal, men will be misled after safety, desires will
multiply and become diversified and views will become confused.
Whoever proceeds towards this mischief will be ruined and whoever strives for it will be
annihilated. They will be biting each other during it as the wild asses bite each other in the
herd. The coils of the rope will be disturbed and the face of affairs will be blinded. During it
sagacity will be on the ebb, and the oppressors will (get the opportunity to) speak. This
mischief will smash the Bedouins with its hammers and crush them with its chest.
In its dust the single marchers will be lost, and in its way the horsemen will be destroyed. It
will approach with the bitterness of destiny and will give pure blood (instead of milk).
It will breach the minarets of faith and shatter the ties of firm belief. The wise will run away
from it while the wicked will foster it. It will thunder and flash (like lightning). It will create a
severe disaster. In it kinship will be forsaken and Islam will be abandoned. He who declaims
it will also be affected by it, and he who flees from it will (be forced to) stay in it.
A part of the same sermon
Among them some will be unavenged martyrs and some will be stricken with fear and seek
protection. They will be deceived by pledges and fraudulent belief. You should not become
landmarks of mischiefs and signs of innovations but should adhere to that on which the rope
of the community has been wound and on which the pillars of obedience have been founded.
Proceed towards Allah as oppressed and do not proceed to Him as oppressors.
Avoid the paths of Satan and the places of revolt. Do not put in your bellies unlawful morsels
because you are facing Him Who has made disobedience unlawful for you, and made the path
of obedience easy for you.
