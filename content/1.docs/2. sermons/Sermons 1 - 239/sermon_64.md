About the transience of the world
Beware ! surely this world is a place from which protection cannot be sought except while
one is in it. The action which is performed only for this world cannot secure salvation.
People are tested in it through calamities. Those who have taken worldly pleasures here will
be taken out from them (by death) and will be questioned about them. And whatever (good
actions) they have achieved for the other world, they will get them there and stay in them.
For the intelligent this world is like the shade - one moment it is spread out and extended but
soon it shrinks and contracts.
