About this world and its people
I warn you of the world for it is the abode of the unsteady. It is not a house for foraging. It has
decorated itself with deception and deceives with its decoration. It is a house which is low
before Allah. So He has mixed its lawful with its unlawful, its good with its evil, its life with
its death, and its sweetness with its bitterness.
Allah has not kept it clear for His lovers, nor has He been niggardly with it towards His foes.
Its good is sparing. Its evil is ready at hand. Its collection would dwindle away.
Its authority would be snatched away. Its habitation would face desolation. What is the good
in a house which falls down like fallen construction or in an age which expires as the
provision exhausts, or in time which passes like walking?
Include whatever Allah has made obligatory on you in your demands. Ask from Him
fulfilment of what He has asked you to do. Make your ears hear the call of death before you
are called by death.
Surely the hearts of the abstemious weep in this world even though they may (apparently)
laugh, and their grief increases even though they may appear happy. Their hatred for
themselves is much even though they may be envied for the subsistence they are allowed.
Remembrance of death has disappeared from your hearts while false hopes are present in you.
So this world has mastered you more than the next world, and the immediate end (of this
world) has removed you away from the remote one (of the next life). You are brethren in the
religion of Allah. Dirty natures and bad conscience have separated you. Consequently you do
not bear burdens of each other nor advise each other, nor spend on each other, nor love each
other.
What is your condition? You feel satisfied with what little you have secured from this world
while much of the next world of which you have been deprived does not grieve you. The little
of this world which you lose pains you so much so that it becomes apparent in your faces, and
in the lack of your endurance over whatever is taken away from you; as though this world is
your permanent abode, and as though its wealth would stay with you for good.
Nothing prevents anyone among you to disclose to his comrade the shortcomings he is afraid
of, except the fear that the comrade would also disclose to him similar defects. You have
decided together on leaving the next world and loving this world. Your religion has become
just licking with the tongue. It is like the work of one who has finished his job and secured
satisfaction of his master.
