Transience of this world, and importance of collecting provisions for
the next life.
O' people, certainly this world is a passage while the next world is a place of permanent
abode. So, take from the passage (all that you can) for the permanent abode. Do not tear away
your curtain before Him Who is aware of your secrets.
Take away from this world your hearts before your bodies go out of it, because herein you
have been put on trial, and you have been created for the other world. When a man dies
people ask what (property) he has left while the angels ask what (good actions) he has sent
forward. May Allah bless you; send forward something, it will be a loan for you, and do not
leave everything behind, for that would be a burden on you.
