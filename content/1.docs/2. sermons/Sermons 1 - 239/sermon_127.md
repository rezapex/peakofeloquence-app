When Amir al-mu'minin was spoken ill of for showing equality in the distribution (of
shares from Bayt al-mal or the Muslim Public Treasury) he said:
Do you command me that I should seek support by oppressing those over whom I have been
placed? By Allah, I won't do so as long as the world goes on, and as long as one star leads
another in the sky. Even if it were my property, I would have distributed it equally among
them, then why not when the property is that of Allah. Beware; certainly that giving of wealth
without any right for it is wastefulness and lavishness.
It raises its doer in this world, but lowers him in the next world. It honours him before people,
but disgraces him with Allah. If a man gives his property to those who have no right for it or
do not deserve it, Allah deprives him of their gratefulness, and their love too would be for
others.
Then if he falls on bad days and needs their help, they would prove the worst comrades and
ignoble friends.
