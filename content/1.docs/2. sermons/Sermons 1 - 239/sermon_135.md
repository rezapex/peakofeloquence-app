Delivered when Caliph `Umar ibn al-Khattab consulted (1) Amir almu'minin
about himself, taking part in the march towards Rome
( Byzantine Empire ).
Allah has taken upon Himself for the followers of this religion the strengthening of
boundaries and hiding of the secret places. Allah helped them when they were few and could
not protect themselves. He is living and will not die.
If you will your self proceed towards the enemy and clash with them and fall into some
trouble, there will be no place of refuge for the Muslims other than their remote cities, nor any
place they would return to.
Therefore, you should send there an experienced man and send with him people of good
performance who are well-intentioned. If Allah grants you victory, then this is what you want.
If it is otherwise, you would serve as a support for the people and a returning place for the
Muslims.
(1). About Amir al-mu'minin, the strange position is adopted that on the one hand, it is said
that he was ignorant of practical politics and unacquainted with ways of administration from
which it is intended that the revolts created by the Umayyad's lust for power should be shown
to be the outcome of Amir al-mu'minin's weak administration. On the other hand, much is
made of the various occasions when the then Caliphs consulted Amir al-mu'minin in important
affairs of State in the matter of wars with unbelievers.
The aim in this is not to exhibit his correctness of thinking and judgement or deep sagacity but
to show that there was unity and concord between him and the Caliphs so that attention
should not be paid to the fact that in some matters they also differed and that mutual clashes
had also occurred. History shows that Amir al-mu'minin did have differences of principles with
the Caliphs and did not approve every step of theirs.
In the sermon of ash-Shiqshiqiyyah he has expressed in loud words his difference of opinion
and anger about each regime. Nevertheless, this difference does not mean that correct
guidance should be withheld in collective Islamic problems.
Again, Amir al-mu'minin's character was so high that no one could imagine that he would ever
evade giving counsel which concerned the common weal, or would give such counsel which
would damage public interests. That is why, despite differences of principle, he was consulted.
This throws light on the greatness of his character and the correctness of his thinking and
judgement.
Similarly, it is a prominent trait of the Holy Prophet's character that despite rejecting his claim
to prophethood the unbelievers acknowledged him the best trustee and could never doubt his
trustworthiness. Rather, even during clashes of mutual opposition they entrusted to him their
property without fear and never suspected that their property would be misappropriated.
Similarly, Amir al-mu'minin was held to occupy so high a position of trust and confidence that
friend and foe both trusted in the correctness of his counsel.
So, just as the Prophet's conduct shows his height of trustworthiness, and just as it cannot be
inferred from it that there was mutual accord between him and the unbelievers, because trust
has its own place while the clash of Islam and unbelief has another, in the same way, despite
having differences with the Caliphs, Amir al-mu'minin was regarded as the protector of national
and community interests and as the guardian of Islam's wellbeing and prosperity.
Thus when national interests were involved he was consulted and he tendered his unbiased
advice raising himself above personal ends and keeping in view the Prophet's tradition to the
effect that "He who is consulted is a trustee" never allowed any dishonesty or duplicity to
interfere.
When on the occasion of the battle of Palestine, the Caliph `Umar consulted him about his
taking part in it himself, then, irrespective of whether or not his opinion would accord with
`Umar's feelings, he kept in view Islam's prestige and existence and counselled him to stay in
his place and to send to the battlefront such a man who should be experienced and wellversed
in the art of fighting, because the going of an inexperienced man would have damaged the
established prestige of Islam and the awe in which the Muslims were held which had existed
from the Prophet's days would have vanished.
In fact, in the Caliph `Umar's going there Amir al-mu'minin saw signs of defeat and
vanquishment. He therefore found Islam's interest to lie in detaining him and indicated his view
in the words that:
"If you have to retreat from the battlefield, it would not be your personal defeat only, but the
Muslims would lose heart by it and leave the battle-field and disperse here and there, because
with the officer in command leaving the field the army too would lose ground.
Furthermore, with the centre being without the Caliph there would be no hope of any further
assistance from behind which could sustain courage of the combatants."
This is that counsel which is put forth as a proof of mutual accord although this advice was
tendered in view of Islam's prestige and life which was dearer to Amir al-mu'minin than any
other interest. No particular individual's life was dear to him for which he might have advised
against participation in the battle.
