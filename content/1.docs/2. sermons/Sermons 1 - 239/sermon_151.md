About future events and some activities of the hypocrites
They took to the right and the left piercing through to the ways of evil and leaving the paths
of guidance. Do not make haste for a matter which is to happen and is awaited, and do not
wish for delay in what the morrow is to bring for you. For, how many people make haste for a
matter, but when they get it they begin to wish they had not got it.
How near is today to the dawning of tomorrow. O' my people, this is the time for the
occurrence of every promised event and the approach of things which you do not know.
Whoever from among us will be during these days will move through them with a burning
lamp and will tread on the footsteps of the virtuous, in order to unfasten knots, to free slaves,
to divide the united and to unite the divided.
He will be in concealment from people. The stalker will not find his footprints even though he
pursues with his eye.
Then a group of people will be sharpened like the sharpening of swords by the blacksmith.
Their sight will be brightened by revelation, the (delicacies of) commentary will be put in
their ears and they will be given drinks of wisdom, morning and evening.
A part of the same sermon
Their period became long in order that they might complete (their position of) disgrace and
deserve vicissitudes, till the end of the period was reached, and a group of people turned
towards mischief and picked up their arms for fighting.
The virtuous did not show any obligation to Allah but calmly endured, and did not feel elated
for having engaged themselves in truthfulness. Eventually the period of trial came to an end
according to what was ordained. Then they propagated their good views among others and
sought nearness to Allah according to the command of their leader.
When Allah took the Prophet (to himself) a group of men went back on their tracks. The ways
(of misguidance) ruined them and they placed trust in deceitful intriguers, showed
consideration to other than kinsmen, abandoned the kin whom they had been ordered to love,
and shifted the building from its strong foundation and built it in other than its (proper) place.
They are the source of every shortcoming and the door of gropers in the dark. They were
moving to and fro in amazement and lay intoxicated in the way of the people of the Pharaohs.
They were either bent on this world and taking support on it or away from the faith and
removed from it.
