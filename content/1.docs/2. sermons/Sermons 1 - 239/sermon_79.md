Supplications of Amir al-mu'minin.
O' my Allah! Forgive me what Thou knowest about me more than I do. If I return (to the sins)
Thou return to forgiveness. My Allah forgive me what I had promised to myself but Thou
didst not find its fulfilment with me.
My Allah forgive me that with what I sought nearness to Thee with my tongue but my heart
opposed and did not perform it. My Allah forgive me winkings of the eye, vile utterances,
desires of the heart and errors of speech.
