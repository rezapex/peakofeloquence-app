About measures and weights, the transience of this world and the
condition of its people
O' creatures of Allah! You and whatever you desire from this world are like guests with fixed
period of stay, and like debtors called upon to pay. Life is getting short while (the records of)
actions are being preserved. Many strivers are wasting (their efforts) and many of those who
exert are heading towards harm. You are in a period when steps of virtue are moving
backwards, steps of evil are moving forward and Satan is increasing his eagerness to ruin
people.
This is the time that his equipment is strong, his traps have been spread and his prey has
become easy (to catch).
Cast your glance over people wherever you like, you will see either a poor man suffering
from poverty, or a rich man ignoring Allah despite His bounty over him, or a miser increasing
his wealth by trampling on Allah's obligations, or an unruly person closing his ears to all
counsel.
Where are your good people; where are your virtuous people? Where are your high spirited
men and generous men? Where are those of you who avoid deceit in their business and
remain pure in their behaviour? Have they not all departed from this ignoble, transitory and
troublesome world? Have you not been left among people who are just like rubbish and so
low that lips avoid mention of them and do not move even to condemn their low position.
... "Verily we are Allah's and verily unto Him shall we return." (Qur'an, 2:156)
Mischief has appeared and there is no one to oppose and change it, nor anyone to dissuade
from it or desist from it. Do you, with these qualities, hope to secure abode in the purified
neighbourhood of Allah and to be regarded His staunch lovers? Alas! Allah cannot be
deceived about His paradise and His will cannot be secured save by His obedience.
Allah may curse those who advise good but they themselves avoid it, and those who desist
others from evil but they themselves act upon it.
