Amir al-mu'minin said about Marwan ibn al-Hakam at Basrah. When Marwan was
taken on the day of Jamal, he asked Hasan and Husayn (p.b.u.t.) to intercede on his
behalf before Amir al-mu'minin. So they spoke to Amir al-mu'minin about him and he
released him. Then they said, "O' Amir al-mu'minin he desires to swear you allegiance"
Whereupon Amir al-mu'minin said:
Did he not swear me allegiance after the killing of `Uthman? Now I do not need his
allegiance, because his is the hand of a Jew. If he swears me allegiance with his hand he
would violate it after a short while. Well, he is to get power for so long as a dog licks his
nose. He is the father of four rams (who will also rule). The people will face days through him
and his sons.(1)
(1). Marwan ibn al-Hakam was the nephew (brother's son) and son-in-law of `Uthman. Due to
thin body and tall stature he was known with the nickname "Khayt Batil" (the thread of wrong).
When `Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan killed `Amr ibn Sa`id al-Ashdaq, his brother Yahya ibn Sa`id
said:
O' sons of Khayt Batil (the thread of the wrong) you have played deceit on `Amr
and people like you build their houses (of authority) on deceit and treachery.
Although his father al-Hakam ibn Abi al-`As had accepted Islam at the time of the fall of Mecca
but his behaviour and activities were very painful to the Prophet. Consequently, the Prophet
cursed him and his descendants and said, "Woe will befall my people from the progeny of this
man." At last in view of his increasing intrigues the Prophet externed him from Medina towards
the valley of Wajj (in Ta'if) and Marwan also went with him.
Prophet did not thereafter allow them entry in Medina all his life. Abu Bakr and `Umar did
likewise, but `Uthman sent for both of them during his reign, and raised Marwan to such
height as though the reins of caliphate rested in his hands.
Thereafter his circumstances became so favourable that on the death of Mu`awiyah ibn Yazid
he became the Caliph of the Muslims.
But he had just ruled only for nine months and eighteen days that death overtook him in such
a way that his wife sat with the pillow on his face and did not get away till he breathed his last.
The four sons to whom Amir al-mu'minin has referred were the four sons of `Abd al-Malik ibn
Marwan namely al-Walid, Sulayman, Yazid and Hisham, who ascended the Caliphate one after
the other and coloured the pages of history with their stories.
Some commentators have regarded this reference to Marwan's own sons whose names are
`Abd al-Malik, `Abd al-`Aziz, Bishr and Muhammad. Out of these `Abd al-Malik did become
Caliph of Islam but `Abd al-`Aziz became governor of Egypt, Bishr of Iraq and Muhammad of
al-Jazirah.
