title: Sermon 27
description: This is sermon 27
---

When Amir al-mu'minin received successive news that Mu`awiyah's men were occupying
cities(1) and his own officers in Yemen namely `Ubaydullah ibn `Abbas and Sa`id ibn
Nimran came to him retreating after being overpowered by Busr ibn Abi Artat, he was much
disturbed by the slackness of his own men in jihad and their difference with his opinion.
Proceeding on to the pulpit he said:
Nothing (is left to me) but Kufah which I can hold and extend (which is in my hand to play
with). (O' Kufah) if this is your condition that whirlwinds continue blowing through you then
Allah may destroy you.
Then he illustrated with the verse of a poet:
O' `Amr! By your good father's life. I have received only a small bit of fat from this pot (fat
that remains sticking to it after it has been emptied).
Then he continued:
I have been informed that Busr has overpowered Yemen. By Allah, I have begun thinking
about these people that they would shortly snatch away the whole country through their unity
on their wrong and your disunity (from your own right), and separation, your disobedience of
your Imam in matters of right and their obedience to their leader in matters of wrong, their
fulfilment of the trust in favour of their master and your betrayal, their good work in their
cities and your mischief.
Even if I give you charge of a wooden bowl I fear you would run away with its handle.
O' my Allah they are disgusted of me and I am disgusted of them. They are weary of me and I
am weary of them. Change them for me with better ones and change me for them with worse
one.
O' my Allah melt their hearts as salt melts in water. By Allah I wish I had only a thousand
horsemen of Banu Firas ibn Ghanm (as the poet says):
If you call them the horsemen would come to you like the summer cloud.
(Thereafter Amir al-mu'minin alighted from the pulpit):
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: In this verse the word "armiyah" is plural of "ramiyy" which means
cloud and "hamim" here means summer. The poet has particularised the cloud of summer
because it moves swiftly. This is because it is devoid of water while a cloud moves slowly
when it is laden with rain. Such clouds generally appear (in Arabia) in winter. By this verse
the poet intends to convey that when they are called and referred to for help they approach
with rapidity and this is borne by the first line "if you call them they will reach you."
(1). When after arbitration Mu`awiyah's position was stabilised he began thinking of taking
possession of Amir al-mu'minin's cities and extend his domain. He sent his armies to different
areas in order that they might secure allegiance for Mu`awiyah by force.
In this connection he sent Busr ibn Abi Artat to Hijaz and he shed blood of thousands of
innocent persons from Hijaz upto Yemen, burnt alive tribes after tribes in fire and killed even
children, so much so that he butchered two young boys of `Ubaydullah ibn `Abbas the
Governor of Yemen before their mother Juwayriyah bint Khalid ibn Qaraz al-Kinaniyyah.
When Amir al-mu'minin came to know of his slaughtering and blood shed he thought of
sending a contingent to crush him but due to continuous fighting people had become weary
and showed heartlessness instead of zeal. When Amir al-mu'minin observed their shirking from
war he delivered this sermon wherein he roused them to enthusiasm and self respect, and
prompted them to jihad by describing before them the enemy's wrongfulness and their own
short-comings.
At last Jariyah ibn Qudamah as-Sa`di responded to his call and taking an army of two
thousand set off in pursuit of Busr and chased him out of Amir al-mu'minin's domain.
