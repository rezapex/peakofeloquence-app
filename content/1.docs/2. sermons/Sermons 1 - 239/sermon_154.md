About negligent persons and the characteristics of beasts, carnivores
and women
He has been allowed time by Allah. He is falling into error along with negligent persons and
goes early in the morning with sinners, without any road to lead or any Imam to guide.
A part of the same sermon
At last when Allah will make clear to them the reward for their sins, and take them out from
the veils of their neglectfulness they will proceed to what they were running away from, and
run away from what they were proceeding to. They will not benefit from the wants they will
satisfy or the desires they would fulfil.
I warn you and myself from this position. A man should derive benefit from his own self.
Certainly, prudent is he who hears and ponders over it, who sees and observes and who
benefits from instructive material and then treads on clear paths wherein he avoids falling into
hollows and straying into pitfalls, and does not assist those who misguide him by turning
away from truthfulness, changing his words, or fearing truth.
O' my listener! Be cured from your intoxication, wake up from your slumber, decrease your
hasty activity and ponder over what has come to you through the Holy Prophet, the Ummi (1)
which is inevitable and inescapable. You should turn away from him who opposes him and
leave him and leave whatever he has adopted for himself. Put off your vanity, drop your
haughtiness and recall your grave because your way passes over it.
You will be dealt with as you deal with others, you will reap what you sow, and what you
send today will meet you tomorrow. So provide for your future and send (some good acts) for
your day (of reckoning). Fear, fear, O' listener! Act, act, O' careless! No one will warn you
like him who knows.
One of the firm decisions of Allah in the Wise Reminder (Qur'an) upon which He bestows
reward or gives punishment, and through which He likes or dislikes is that it will not benefit a
man, even though he exerts himself and acts sincerely if he leaves this world to meet Allah
with one of these acts without repenting, namely that he believed in a partner with Allah
during his obligatory worship, or appeased his own anger by killing an individual, or spoke
about acts committed by others, or sought fulfilment of his needs from people by introducing
an innovation in his religion, or met people with a double face, or moved among them with a
double tongue.
Understand this because an illustration is a guide for its like.
Beasts are concerned with their bellies. Carnivores are concerned with assaulting others.
Women are concerned with the adornments of this ignoble life and the creation of mischief
herein (2). (On the other hand) believers are humble, believers are admonishers and believers
are afraid (of Allah).
(1). The word "ummi" has been used in the Holy Qur'an with reference to the Holy Prophet in
chapter 7:157-158. For better understanding of the word refer to the books of commentary on
the Holy Qur'an. (2). The intention is to say that the cause of all mischief and evil is the
passion to satisfy bodily needs and the passion to subdue.
If a human being is subjugated by the passion to satisfy bodily needs and considers filling the
stomach as his aim there will be no difference between him and a beast, because a beast too
has no aim except to fill its belly.
But if he is over-powered by the passion to subdue others and takes to killing and devastation
there will be no difference between him and a carnivorous beast, because the latter's aim is
also tearing and devouring.
If both the passions are at work in him then he is like a woman, because in a woman both
these passions act side by side and because of this she is extremely eager of adornment and is
active in fanning mischief and disturbance.
However, a true believer will never agree to adopt these habits as his mode of behaviour,
rather he keeps his passions suppressed so that he neither allows pride and vanity to approach
near him nor does he fan mischief or disturbance for fear of Allah.
Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written that Amir al-mu'minin delivered this sermon at the time of marching
towards Basrah, and since the trouble of Basrah was the result of a woman's instigation, Amir
al-mu'minin has, after mentioning beasts and carnivore, held a woman also to possess such
qualities. Thus the battle of Basrah was the result of these qualities, whereby thousands of
persons were involved in death and destruction.
