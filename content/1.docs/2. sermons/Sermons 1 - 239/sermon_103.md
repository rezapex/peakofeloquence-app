description: This is sermon 103

On the same subject - Day of Judgement
That day would be such that Allah would collect on it the anteriors and the posteriors, to stand
in obedience for exaction of accounts and for award of recompense for deeds. Sweat would
flow upto their mouths like reins while the earth would be trembling under them.
In the best condition among them would be he who has found a resting place for both his feet
and an open place for his breath.
A part of the same sermon about future troubles (fitan)
The troubles are like a dark night. Horses would not stand for (facing) them nor would their
banners turn back. They would approach in full reins and ready with saddles. Their leader
would be driving them and the rider would be exerting (them).
The trouble-mongers are a people whose attacks are severe. Those who would fight them for
the sake of Allah would be a people who are low in the estimation of the proud, unknown in
the earth but well known on the sky. Woe to you O' Basrah, when an army of Allah's
infliction would face upon you without (raising) dust of cries. Your inhabitants would then
face bloody death and dire hunger.
