What Amir al-mu'minin said on the occasion of the burial of Sayyidatu'n-nisa' (Supreme lady)
Fatimah (p.b.u.h.) while addressing the Holy Prophet at his grave.
O' Prophet of Allah, peace be upon you from me and from your daughter who has come to
you and who has hastened to meet you. O' Prophet of Allah, my patience about your chosen
(daughter) has been exhausted, and my power of endurance has weakened, except that I have
ground for consolation in having endured the great hardship and heart-rending event of your
separation. I laid you down in your grave when your last breath had passed (when your head
was) between my neck and chest.
... Verily we are Allah's and verily unto Him shall we return. (Qur'an 2:156)
Now. the trust has been returned and what had been given has been taken back. As to my
grief, it knows no bounds, and as to my nights. they will remain sleepless till Allah chooses
for me the house in which you are now residing.
Certainly, your daughter would apprise you of the joining together of your (1) ummah
(people) for oppressing her. You ask her in detail and get all the news about the position. This
has happened when a long time had not elapsed and your remembrance had not disappeared.
My salam (salutation) be on you both, the salam of a grief stricken not a disgusted or hateful
person; for if I go away it is not because I am weary (of you), and if I stay it is not due to lack
of belief in what Allah has promised the endurers.
(1). The treatment meted out to the daughter of the Prophet after his death was extremely
painful and sad. Although Sayyidatu'n-nisa' Fatimah (p.b.u.h.) did not live in this world more
than a few months after the death of the Prophet yet even this short period has a long tale of
grief and woe (about her).
In this connection, the first scene that strikes the eyes is that arrangements for the funeral
rites of the Prophet had not yet been made when the contest for power started in the Saqifah
of Banu Sa`idah. Naturally, their leaving the body of the Prophet (without burial) must have
injured Sayyidatu'n-nisa' Fatimah's grief-stricken heart when she saw that those who had
claimed love and attachment (with the Prophet) during his life became so engrossed in their
machinations for power that instead of consoling his only daughter they did not even know
when the Prophet was given a funeral ablution and when he was buried, and the way they
condoled her was that they crowded at her house with material to set fire to it and tried to
secure allegiance by force with all the display of oppression, compulsion and violence.
All these excesses were with a view to so obliterate the prestigious position of this house that it
might not regain its lost prestige on any occasion. With this aim in view, in order to crush her
economic position, her claim for (the estate of) Fadak was turned down by dubbing it as false,
the effect of which was that Sayyidatu'n-nisa' Fatimah (p.b.u.h.) made the dying will that none
of them should attend her funeral.
