title: Sermon 33
description: This is sermon 33
---

When before the commencement of the Battle of Jamal Amir al-mu'minin sent
`Abdullah ibn `Abbas to az-Zubayr ibn al- `Awwam with the purpose that he should
advise him back to obedience, he said to him on that occasion:
Do not meet Talhah (ibn `Ubaydillah). If you meet him you will find him like an unruly bull
whose horns are turned towards its ears. He rides a ferocious riding beast and says it has been
tamed. But you meet az-Zubayr because he is soft-tempered. Tell him that your maternal
cousin says that, "(It looks as if) in the Hijaz you knew me (accepted me), but (on coming
here to) Iraq you do not know me (do not accept me). So, what has dissuaded (you) from what
was shown (by you previously)?!"
as-Sayyid ar-Radi says: The last sentence of this sermon "fama `ada mimma bada" has been
heard only from Amir al-mu'minin.
