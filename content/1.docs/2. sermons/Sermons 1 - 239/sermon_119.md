In praise of his faithful companions
You are supporters of Truth and brethren in faith. You are the shield on the day of tribulation,
and (my) trustees among the rest of the people.
With your support I strike the runner away and hope for the obedience of him who advances
forward. Therefore, extend to me support which is free from deceit and pure from doubt
because, by Allah, I am the most preferable of all for the people.
