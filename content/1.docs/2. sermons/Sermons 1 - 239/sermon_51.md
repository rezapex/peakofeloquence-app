About Allah's greatness and sublimity
Praise be to Allah Who lies inside all hidden things, and towards Whom all open things guide.
He cannot be seen by the eye of an onlooker, but the eye which does not see Him cannot deny
Him while the mind that proves His existence cannot perceive Him.
He is so high in sublimity that nothing can be more sublime than He, while in nearness, He is
so near that no one can be nearer than He. But his sublimity does not put Him at a distance
from anything of His creation, nor does His nearness bring them on equal level to Him.
He has not informed (human) wit about the limits of His qualities. Nevertheless, He has not
prevented it from securing essential knowledge of Him. So he is such that all signs of
existence stand witness for Him till the denying mind also believes in Him. Allah is sublime
beyond what is described by those who liken Him to things or those who deny Him.
