When Amir al-mu'minin heard the cry of Kharijites that "Verdict is
only that of Allah" he said:
The sentence is right but what (they think) it means, is wrong. It is true that verdict lies but
with Allah, but these people say that (the function of) governance is only for Allah. The fact
is that there is no escape for men from ruler good or bad.
The faithful persons perform (good) acts in his rule while the unfaithful enjoys (worldly)
benefits in it. During the rule, Allah would carry everything to end. Through the ruler tax is
collected, enemy is fought, roadways are protected and the right of the weak is taken from the
strong till the virtuous enjoys peace and allowed protection from (the oppression of) the
wicked.
Another version:
When Amir al-mu'minin heard the cry of the Kharijites on the said verdict he said:
I am expecting the verdict (destiny) of Allah on you.
Then he continued:
As for good government the pious man performs good acts in it, while in a bad government
the wicked person enjoys till his time is over and death overtakes him.
