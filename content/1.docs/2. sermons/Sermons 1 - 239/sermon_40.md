About naming of doubt as such and disparagement of those in doubt
Doubt is named doubt because it resembles truth. As for lovers of Allah, their conviction
serves them as light and the direction of the right path (itself) serves as their guide; while the
enemies of Allah, in time of doubt call to misguidance in the darkness of doubt and their
guide is blindness (of intelligence). One who fears death cannot escape it nor can one who
fears for eternal life secure it.
