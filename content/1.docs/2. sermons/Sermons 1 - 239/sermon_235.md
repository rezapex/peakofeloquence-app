Spoken when Amir al-mu'minin was busy in the funeral ablution
(ghusl) of the Holy Prophet and shrouding him
May my father and my mother shed their lives for you. O' Messenger of Allah! With your
death the process of prophethood, revelation and heavenly messages has stopped, which had
not stopped at the death of others (prophets).
Your position with us (members of your family) is so special that your grief has become a
source of consolation (to us) as against the grief of all others; your grief is also common so
that all Muslims share it equally.
If you had not ordered endurance and prevented us from bewailing, we would have produced
a store of tears and even then the pain would not have subsided, and this grief would not have
ended, and they would have been too little of our grief for you. But this (death) is a matter
that cannot be reversed nor is it possible to repulse it.
May my father and my mother die for you; do remember us with Allah and take care of us.
