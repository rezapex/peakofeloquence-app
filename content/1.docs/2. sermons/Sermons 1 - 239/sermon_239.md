Amir al-mu'minin describes herein the members of the Prophet's
family
They are life for knowledge and death for ignorance. Their forbearance tells you of their
knowledge, and their silence of the wisdom of their speaking. They do not go against right
nor do they differ (among themselves) about it. They are the pillars of Islam and the asylums
of (its) protection.
With them right has returned to its position and wrong has left its place and its tongue is
severed from its root. They have understood the religion attentively and carefully, not by
mere heresy or from relaters, because the relaters of knowledge are many but its
understanders are few.
