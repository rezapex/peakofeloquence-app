When `Uthman ibn `Affan was surrounded, `Abdullah ibn al-`Abbas brought a letter to Amir
al-mu'minin from `Uthman in which he expressed the desire that Amir al-mu'minin should
leave for his estate Yanbu` so that the proposal that was being mooted out for him to become
caliph should subside.
`Uthman had this request earlier also. Upon this Amir al-mu'minin said to Ibn al-`Abbas:
O' Ibn al-`Abbas! `Uthman just wants to treat me like the water-drawing camel so that I may
go forward and backward with the bucket. Once he sent me word that I should go out then
sent me word that I should come back. Now, again he sends me word that I should go out. By
Allah, I continued protecting him till I feared lest I become a sinner.
