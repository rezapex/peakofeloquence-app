description: This is sermon 233

On Ja`dah ibn Hubayrah al-Makhzumi's (1) inability to deliver a
sermon. About speaking the truth
Know that the tongue is a part of a man's body. If the man desists, speech will not co-operate
with him and when he dilates, speech will not give him time to stop.
Certainly, we are the masters of speaking. Its veins are fixed in us and its branches are
hanging over us.
Know that - may Allah have mercy on you - you are living at a time when those who speak
about right are few, when tongues are loath to utter the truth and those who stick to the right
are humiliated. The people of this time are engaged in disobedience.
Their youths are wicked, their old men are sinful, their learned men are hypocrites, and their
speakers are sycophants. Their youngs do not respect their elders, and their rich men do not
support the destitute.
(1). Once Amir al-mu'minin asked his nephew (sister's son) Ja`dah ibn Hubayrah al-Makhzumi
to deliver a sermon, but when he rose for speaking his tongue faltered and he could utter
nothing, whereupon Amir al-mu'minin ascended the pulpit to speak and delivered a long
sermon out of which a few sentences have been recorded here by as-Sayyid ar-Radi.
