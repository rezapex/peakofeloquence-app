`Abdullah ibn `Abbas says that when Amir al-mu'minin set out for war with the people of
Basrah he came to his audience at Dhiqar and saw that he was stitching his shoe. Then Amir
al-mu'minin said to me, "What is the price of this shoe?" I said: "It has no value now." He
then said, "By Allah, it should have been more dear to me than ruling over you but for the fact
that I may establish right and ward off wrong." Then he came out and spoke:
Verily, Allah sent Muhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.p.) when none among the Arabs read a book or
claimed prophethood. He guided the people till he took them to their (correct) position and
their salvation. So their spears (i.e. officers) became straight and their conditions settled
down.
By Allah, surely I was in their lead till it took shape with its walls. I did not show weakness or
cowardice. My existing march is also like that. I shall certainly pierce the wrong till right
comes out of its side.
What (cause of conflict) is there between me and the Quraysh? By Allah, I have fought them
when they were unbelievers and I shall fight them when they have been misled. I shall be the
same for them today as I was for them yesterday.
By Allah, the Quraysh only take revenge against us because Allah has given us (i.e. the Holy
Prophet and his progeny) preference over them. So, we have allowed them into our domain,
whereupon they have become as the former poet says:
By my life, you continued drinking fresh milk every morning,
And (continued) eating fine stoned dates with butter;
We have given you the nobility which you did not possess before;
And surrounded (protected) you with thoroughbred horses and tawny-coloured
spears (strong spears) (1).
(1). In fact, the aim of the poet here is to say that the condition of the addressee's life, from
the moral and material point of view, had been worse in the past, and that the poet and his
tribe have given him the best means of leading their lives.
But as the result of this improved condition the addressee has completely lost himself and
forgotten his past condition and thinks that he had had this kind of life previously.
Now, Amir al-mu'minin wants to convey the same idea here to the Quraysh as Fatimah (p.b.u.
h.) the holy daughter of the Holy Prophet said in her speech on Fadak:
(O' People) ... You were on the brink of the pit of Hell Fire (Qur'an, 3:103). You were as
worthless as the mouthful of water. You were minority like the handful greedy and a spark of
the hasty. You were as down-trodden as the dust under feet. You drank dirty water. You ate
untanned skin. You were abased and condemned. But Allah has rescued you through my father
Muhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.p.). . .
