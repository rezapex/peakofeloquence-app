title: Orations 425 by a limit or reckoned by counting, for
---
# Chapter 42: Orations 425 by a limit or reckoned by counting, for
instruments can only limit other instru- ments, and implements can only
indicate similar things. "Since" prevents them from antiquity, "just"
precludes them from eternity, and "if not for" drives them from
perfection.1 Through these things, the artisan who crafted them displays
his light to intellects, yet because of these things, it is impossible
for eyes to see him. Stillness and motion do not apply to him. How can
something he set forth apply to him? How can something he originated
become part of him? How can something he made happen, happen to him? If
that were the case, his being would have contrasting modes, his essence
would be divided into parts, and it would be impossible for his reality
to be eternal. If he had a front, he would also have a back, if he were
incomplete, he would need completing, and if that were the case, the
mark of craftsmanship would appear in him. He would become a sign
instead of something to which all signs point. But---through the utter
impossibility of that being the case---nothing that affects his
creatures affects God. 1.184.2 He is the one who never changes, never
ceases, never sets. He has not begotten, else he himself would be like
one born, he was not begotten, else he would be constrained.2 His glory
precludes begetting sons, his purity pre- cludes intimacy with women.
The imagination cannot attain or measure him, the intellect cannot
imagine or picture him, our senses cannot grasp or sense him, our hands
cannot touch or feel him. No situation causes him to change, no
conditions cause him to alter.The passage of night and day do not cause
him to decay, light and dark do not cause him to transform. He cannot be
described as possessing parts, or limbs and organs, or segments, or
accidental qualities that can change, or the trait of being other than
something, or comprised of sec- tions. It cannot be said of him that he
has limit, end, termination, conclusion, or that things control him so
as to raise or lower him, or that things carry him so as to balance him
or cause him to incline. He neither enters into things nor exits them.
He informs without tongue or mouth. He hears without ears or any other
organ. He speaks without uttering, remembers without memorizing, and
wills without pondering. He loves and is pleased without sentiment, he
hates and is angry without toil. For anything whose being he wills, he
says «"Be!"--- and it is,»3 without emitting a sound that strikes the
ear, or a call that can be 1 Ar. mundhu, qad, and law-lā. These words
distinguish creatures from the creator, to whom none of these terms
apply, for they imply coming into existence, being newly created, and
imperfection. 2 Reference to Qurʾan, Ikhlāṣ112:3. 3 Qurʾan, Baqarah

427 heard. Rather, his speaking of words is itself an act that he
created and formed. His words did not exist before, for if they had been
present from antiquity, they would have constituted a second god. It
cannot be said of him that he came into being after non-existence, or
else the attributes of newly created beings would apply to him, there
would be no difference then between him and them, nor would he possess
any distinction over them. The craftsman and his craft would become the
same, the initiator and the initiated would become equal. 1.184.3 He
created his creation without using an earlier model, without seek- ing
help from any of his creatures. Forming the earth, he held it firm with-
out labor, anchored it without a seabed, erected it without supports,
raised it without pillars, ensured it was safe from bending and
buckling, and secured it from disintegration and rupture. He then set
down its stakes, established its barriers, released its wellsprings, and
furrowed its valleys. What he built never becomes unstable, what he
strengthened never becomes weak. He is powerful over it through his
authority and glory, he is concealed within it through his knowledge and
recognition, he is lofty above all things through his magnificence and
might. Nothing that he seeks eludes him, nothing can stand up against
him or overpower him, no creature can outrun or outstrip him, he needs
no wealthy benefactor to sustain him. All things bow to him and efface
themselves before his majesty. No one can flee his power or be free of
his benefit or harm. He has no equal to match him, no peer to rival him.
1.184.4 He will annihilate the world after its existence, until
everything that existed in it will be lost. But the annihilation of the
world after its creation is no more marvelous than its origination and
formation. How could it not be so? For if all the world's living beings
came together---its birds and its beasts, all its cattle in stables and
pastures, all its many species in terms of their ori- gins and types,
the dullards among its nations and the clever---if they all came
together to try to create a gnat, they could not, they would never find
a way to bring it into existence. Their minds would be dazed by the
attempt to know how, their faculties would be perplexed and
incapacitated and would retreat, beaten and weary, recognizing defeat,
conceding their incapacity to bring it into existence, and acknowledging
that they are too weak even to cause its destruction. God will once
again be alone after the annihilation of this world--- nothing else will
exist with him. As he was before its beginning, so will he be
afteritsend,beyondseason,place,moment,ortime.Lifespansandseasonswill
become non-existent, years and hours will cease. Nothing will remain

1: Orations 429 one, the vanquisher, to whom all affairs return. The
beginning of their creation
tookplacewithouttheirvolition,theirannihilationtoowillcomewithoutthem
having the power to arrest its march. If they had been able to, they
would have existed forever. 1.184.5 Crafting any part of what he crafted
caused him no hardship. Cre- ating what he created, what he formed,
caused him no fatigue. He did not bring his creatures into being in
order to consolidate his authority, or from fear of cessation or loss,
or to bolster his worth against a wealthier peer, or to protect himself
from an avenging enemy, or to expand his kingdom, or to boast of greater
riches to a partner, or out of loneliness such that he wanted the
comfort of their company. Now, after bringing the world into being, he
will annihilate it, but not because he is wearied by planning and
running it, or to seek rest, or because any of it weighs him down. Its
long existence does not tire him and require him to annihilate it
swiftly. He has planned it through his grace, upheld it with his
command, and perfected it with his power. After annihilating it, he will
bring it back again. This, too, without hav- ing a need for it, without
seeking help from any creature to create it, or to emerge from a state
of loneliness to a state of comfort, or from a state of igno- rance and
blindness to knowledge and attainment, or from poverty and desti- tution
to wealth and abundance, or from shame and abjectness to might and
power. 1.185 From an oration by ʿAlī prophesying a calamitous time:1 I
would offer my father and mother as ransom for that host whose names are
recognized in the heavens but remain unknown on earth. Hark, people,
pre- pare for what is coming! Your affairs will soon turn topsy turvy,
your ties will soon be severed. Only the rash among you will find
employment. On that day, it will be easier for a believer to suffer the
blow of a sword than to earn a single dirham through licit means. On
that day, the receiver will be rewarded more than the giver.2 On that
day, you will become intoxicated, not from drink, but with luxury and
affluence, you will swear gratuitous oaths and lie without scruple. On
that day, calamity will bite like a packsaddle biting into a camel's
withers.Ohowlengthythehardship,howdistantthehope!People!Stopdriving
beasts you have loaded with sin! Stop challenging your authorities, or
you will 1 Excerpt from an oration ʿAlī delivered in Kufa after the
Battle of Nahrawān in 38/658. Ḥ6:134-- 135, after Madāʾinī (the
preceding lines are also recorded). 2 Because those who give at this
time will do so from illicit earnings, while those who receive will do
so legitimately. Ḥ13:96--97; B 712; F 350; R 2:440. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

thanks for his bounties to you, his blessings on you, and his favors for
you. How often has he singled you out for a blessing and rescued you
with an act of mercy! You revealed your shame, and he concealed it, you

How can you place your hopes in something which will not grant you
reprieve? The dead whom you have seen with your own eyes are sufficient
counselors. They are carried to their graves, not riding there, then
placed inside without choosing to dismount, as though they had never
lived merrily in the world, as though the hereafter had always been
their home. Now, they recoil from their earlier abode, they make their
home in that place from which they had ear- lier recoiled. Long did they
occupy themselves with concerns they now have to leave behind! Long did
they ignore the cares to which they are now trans- ported!2 Now, they
cannot run away from their vile deeds or increase their stock of good.
They became familiar and comfortable with the world, and she deceived
them. They trusted her, and she hurled them to the ground. People, race
toward the home that you have been commanded to inhabit---may God have
mercy on you!---the one to which you have been urged and invited. Seek
the completion of God's blessings through obedience, do good and shun
sin, for tomorrow is close to today. O how swift the passage of hours in
a day! How swift the passage of days in a month! Howswift the passage of
months in a year! How swift the passage of years in a lifetime! 1.187
From an oration by ʿAlī:3 1 Excerpt from ʿAlī's oration soon after his
accession to the caliphate in Medina, when he was informed that Ṭalḥah
and Zubayr had rebelled. Iskāfī, Miʿyār, 109--111. 2
Or,"Theyareoccupiedwithpayingforthethingstheyhavehadtoleavebehind,havingsquan-
dered the opportunity to prepare for that to which they are now
transported." Ḥ13:100. 3 This could be an excerpt from an early oration
in Medina in 35--36/356, since the penultimate line, "Ask me before you
lose me," is said to be the prompt for Dhiʿlib's question about seeing
God and ʿAlī's answer in §1.177 (Ṣadūq, Amālī, 423, Majlis no. 55; see
note there), set in Med- ina. But, on the other hand, the line also
occurs in §90.2, from the late Kufa period, ca. 38/658, and in another
oration in Māmaṭīrī, Nuzhah, 145--147---the line appears to be a
recurrent one in ʿAlī's orations, from the beginning of his caliphate to
the end. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -

433 Some people's hearts are firm and steadfast in belief, while for
others belief is a temporary loan lodged between heart and breast. If
you wish to dissociate from anyone, wait until death comes to him---that
is the point at which dis- sociation becomes appropriate.1 Migration
continues to be required as it was when first mandated,2 although God
has no need of any of the earth's people, neither those who conceal
their affiliation to this community, nor those who declare it publicly.3
Moreover, the honor of migration is not earned by a person unless he
recognizes God's proof on earth.4 To recognize and acknowledge this
proof is to be a true migrant. The phrase "too weak" does not apply to
anyone whom God's proof reaches, that is, if his ears hear it and his
heart preserves it.5 Our affair is hard and challenging, and only a
person whose heart God has tested with belief can bear it patiently. Our
words are preserved only by trusted hearts and mature minds. People! Ask
me before you lose me, for I know more about the pathways of the heavens
than I do about the pathways of the earth! Do this before sedition
rushes to attack, raising its hind-foot, trampling on its nose-rein, and
destroying people's minds. 1.188 From an oration by ʿAlī:6 I offer
praise to God in thanks for his blessings and ask his aid in upholding
his rights. His army is mighty, and his nobility great. I bear testimony
that Muḥam- mad is his servant and messenger, who called on people to
obey God and vanquished his enemies, fighting tirelessly to defend his
religion. They banded together to call him a liar and attempted to
extinguish his light, but they could not turn him away from his purpose.
1 I.e., see whether the person dies a believer or an unbeliever before
you cast him off. 2 Ar. hijrah. The first migration refers to the
migration to Medina, the Prophet Muḥammad's city, following his own
migration there from Mecca. 3
Translationbasedonreadingmāasanegationandthetwosentencesasindependentclauses,
based on B 717; R 2:444--445. If we read mā to be the particle that
means "as long as," the two lines would be combined into one clause
(cf. Ḥ13:103), and would translate quite differently as: "Migration
continues to be required as it was when first mandated, as long as God
has need of any of the earth's people, those who conceal their
affiliation to this community and those who declare it publicly." 4 The
Shiʿi commentators Baḥrānī (B 717--718) and Rāwandī (R 2:444--445) state
that "God's proof" is the Imam. The Sunni Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd
(Ḥ13:103--104) says this passage is about the "secrets of legatee-ship,"
and it refers to migration toward the Imam, ʿAlī himself. Both are
effectively saying the same thing. 5 Reference to Qurʾan, Nisāʾ 4:97,
which excuses people who are "too weak" from migrating to Medina. 6
Called one of ʿAlī's most eloquent orations, especially for the rhythmic
and graphic descrip- tion of hellfire; echoed later by Ibn Nubātah
al-Khaṭīb (d. 374/985) (Ḥ13:114; B 725). The last paragraph about
standing fast is interpreted variously: ʿAlī is either (1) instructing
his Kufan supporters not to be hasty in drawing swords against the
Kharijites (Ḥ13:113); or (2) directing his followers never to draw
swords in the absence of the rightful Imam (B 725); possibly both.
