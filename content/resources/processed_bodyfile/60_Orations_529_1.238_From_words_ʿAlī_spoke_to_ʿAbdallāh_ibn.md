# Chapter 60: Orations 529 1.238 From words ʿAlī spoke to ʿAbdallāh ibn
al-ʿAbbās1---Ibn al-ʿAbbās had brought ʿAlī a missive from ʿUthmān ibn
ʿAffān, who was under siege, asking him to depart for his estate in
Yanbuʿ al-Nakhl, hoping this would stop people calling out ʿAlī's name
for the caliphate; ʿUthmān had made the same demand of ʿAlī earlier.
ʿAlī responded to Ibn al-ʿAbbās:
Ibnal-ʿAbbās!ʿUthmānwishestomakemeacameldrawingwaterwithapulley,con-
stantly going forward and back! He insisted that I leave, then sent for
me to return, and now he has again sent you with instructions for me to
leave! By God, I have defended him until I feared I was sinning! This is
the end of the section on orations. It is followed by selections from
ʿAlī's letters and epistles. 1 In Medina, 35/656. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

the Faithful's dis- patches and letters to his enemies and his regional
governors, including selections from instructions to his tax collectors
and testaments to his family and companions 2.1 From ʿAlī's dispatch to
the residents of Kufa, when he was about to march from Medina on Basra:1
From God's servant, ʿAlī, Commander of the Faithful, to the residents of
Kufa--- renowned face of the Allies, crest of the Arabs.2 And now to the
matter at hand: I write to inform you of what happened to ʿUthmān, and
when you hear my words,3 you will see the events unfold before your
eyes: The public censured ʿUthmān for his conduct, and the Emigrants
each took their stand. I tried hard to reconcile and lower the heat,
while Ṭalḥah and Zubayr galloped to escalate the affair, harshly driving
the camels of castigation toward their destination, and ʿĀʾishah fired
out an angry outburst.4 A group, emboldened, killed ʿUth- mān. The
Muslims then pledged allegiance to me as their caliph, willingly and of
their free choice, without any coercion or force. Kufans, know that
Medina 1 Sent with Ḥasan and ʿAmmār in 36/656, from Rabadhah, 200km to
the NE of Medina, soon after ʿAlī's accession to the caliphate, on his
way to confront ʿĀʾishah, Ṭalḥah, and Zubayr, who had rebelled and
marched to Basra to garner military support (Mufīd, Jamal, 131--132).
See also Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd's (Ḥ14:8--21) "Accounts of ʿAlī's march on
Basra, and his letters to the residents of Kufa." See also comments on
ʿĀʾishah's, Ṭalḥah's, and Zubayr's later repentance, according to this
Sunni-Muʿtazilī account (Ḥ14:24--25). 2 "Allies" (Anṣār) here refers
either to (1) the Medinese Allies, of which there was a small but
discrete section in Kufa in the earliest time of its settlement
(cf. Ṭabarī, Tārīkh, 4:44--45); or (2) ʿAlī's allies more generally
(Ḥ14:6; R 3:12). "Crest," lit. "camel's hump (sanām)." 3 Note that ʿAlī
writes, "When you hear my words." At this time, and for some centuries
there- after, official state letters and proclamations were read out to
the populace in the mosque or other public space. Similarly, in §2.73. 4
WhenʿUthmānstoodupinthemosquetryingtoappeasethepublic,ʿĀʾishahreportedlyspoke
harshly from behind a curtain, and she displayed a pair of the Prophet's
slippers, shouting that ʿUthmān had "changed the Prophet's religion,
when the Prophet's slippers had not even worn out" (B 785). ʿĀʾishah
reportedly called out to the people of Medina to "Kill the Long- beard
(naʿthal)!" ʿUthmān's nickname (R 3:13). Unusually, ʿAlī calls her out
by name in this letter, presumably due to the very real and imminent
danger she posed in that moment. In the aftermath of the battle, he used
the generic "woman/women" to allude to her: §1.13, §1.77, §1.151.3,
§1.154.1. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -

2: Letters 533 reels, and its people reel with it.1 It boils like a
cauldron and revolt has raised its banner, so hasten to join your ruler
and advance to fight your enemy! Battle, if that be God's will, looms
ahead. 2.2 From ʿAlī's dispatch to the residents of Kufa, after his
victory at Basra:2 Residents of Kufa, may God reward you on behalf of
your Prophet's family! May he bestow on you the reward he reserves for
those who obey him through their actions and thank him for his favors!
You heard and you obeyed, you were called, and you answered. 2.3 From a
missive that ʿAlī wrote to his judge, Shurayḥibn al-Ḥārith. It is
related that during ʿAlī's reign, Shurayḥibn al-Ḥārith, a judge
appointed by the Commander of the Faithful, purchased a house for eighty
gold dinars. The news reached ʿAlī, who sum- moned Shurayḥand said, "I'm
told that you have bought a house for eighty gold dinars, and that you
wrote up a contract and called witnesses to attest to the purchase."
Shu- rayḥresponded, "That is correct, Commander of the Faithful." ʿAlī
looked at Shurayḥ with some anger, then said to him:3 Shurayḥ, soon
there will come to you one who will not look at your written con- tract
nor ask for your testimonials but will turn you out of your house and
over to your grave. Take heed, Shurayḥ! You had better not have bought
this house with money that doesn't belong to you or in coin gained from
unlawful sources. If so, you will have lost the abode of this world and
the abode of the hereafter. If you had come to me when you were about to
buy the house, I would have writ- ten up a different kind of contract,
in this manner. You would not then have wished to purchase this house
for a single silver dirham, let alone for the sum you paid. The
transcript: This is what a humble servant has bought from a
soon-to-be-dead man whose departure from the world has already begun.
The humble servant bought from the soon-to-be-dead man one of the houses
of calamity located in the district of those soon-to-perish in the
quarter of the dead. There are four borders to this house: The first
extends to the summons of calamity, the second extends 1 "Medina," lit.
"The Home of Migration" (dār al-hijrah; Ḥ14:8; B 785; R 3:15). Rāwandī
(R 3:15) states it could also refer to "Kufa, to which ʿAlī migrated,"
which appears incorrect, as ʿAlī set- tled there only after the Battle
of the Camel. 2 In36/656,inBasra,followingtheBattleof
theCamel,sentwithʿAmribnSalamahal-Hamdānī al-Arḥabī. The Kufans had been
the mainstay of ʿAlī's army. Full letter in Mufīd, Jamal, 216, after
Wāqidī. 3 Shurayḥserved as judge in Kufa during ʿAlī's reign,

535 to the summons of catastrophe, the third extends to destructive
passions, and the fourth extends to Satan, the great deceiver. The door
of this house opens from this side. This man, deceived by false hopes,
has bought this house from that man, who is soon to be evicted by death.
The buyer has left the protec- tive might of contentment and entered the
shameful condition of petition and entreaty---he has not purchased
anything good. Might belongs to God, who decomposes the bodies of kings,
snatches the souls of pharaohs, destroys the empire of despots such as
Chosroes, Caesar, Tubbaʿ, and Ḥimyar, rulers who
amassedwealth,whoconstructed,fortified,decorated,furnished,hoarded,and
stockpiled, thinking they were providing for their children. When the
com- mand comes for the final judgment, all will be forced to the dock
of review and reckoning, the station of reward and punishment, «and
there shall the falsifiers lose everything.»1 This contract has been
witnessed by an intellect liberated from the shackles of passion and
protected from worldly attachments. 2.4 From ʿAlī's dispatch to one of
his army commanders:2 If they reenter the canopy of obedience, then that
is what we desire. But if their
affairsdirectthemtodissentanddisobey,thenriseupwiththosewhoobeyyou to
fight those who disobey, make do with those who accept your leadership,
without seeking the help of the recalcitrant. One who marches against
his will is better absent than present. He is more helpful to us sitting
than standing. 2.5 From ʿAlī's dispatch to al-Ashʿath ibn Qays, his
governor in Azerbaijan:3 Your governorship is not a meal for you to
devour but a trust to which your neck is shackled. You have been charged
with taking care of it by a man who is supe- rior to you in rank, and
are not authorized to order your subjects around, or to imperil their
funds---those must be secured. What you have in your hands is property
belonging to God---you have been entrusted with safeguarding it and
submitting it to me. Rest assured, however, that I shall be one of the
kinder rulers you encounter.4 Go in peace. 1 Qurʾan, Ghāfir 40:78. 2
Excerpt from dispatch to ʿUthmān ibn Ḥunayf, governor of Basra, when
many residents had turned away from their sworn pledge to ʿAlī, after
ʿĀʾishah, Ṭalḥah, and Zubayr marched there in the lead-up to the Battle
of the Camel in 36/656. B 787. 3 Excerpt from letter to Ashʿath
following the Battle of the Camel in 36/656, when Ashʿath seized 100,000
dirhams from the treasury. Minqarī, Waqʿat Ṣiffīn, 20; B 787; Ḥ14:34,

worst of rulers you encounter." The line is meant to placate. B 787; Ḥ

537 2.6 From ʿAlī's letter to Muʿāwiyah:1 The same people who pledged
allegiance to Abū Bakr, ʿUmar, and ʿUthmān pledged allegiance to me, and
they did so on the same basis.2 Those who were
presentdidnothavetherighttochoose,andthoseabsentdidnothavetheright to
object---consultation is reserved for the Emigrants and Allies alone,
and if
theyagreeonsomeoneandnamehimtheirleader,thenthatisGod'swill.After- ward,
if a person secedes from the consensus with accusations and excuses,
they should compel him to return. If he refuses, they should fight him,
for he has strayed from the path of believers, and God will shun him for
as long as he continues his recalcitrance. By my life, Muʿāwiyah, if you
would look with your mind and not your passion, you would find me of all
people to have the least share of blame in the matter of ʿUthmān's
blood, you would know that I kept away from the fray. Unless you insist
on making a patently false accusation---if so, then go ahead and accuse
me of what you will! Go in peace. 2.7 From another letter sent by ʿAlī
to Muʿāwiyah:3 I have received from you a string of advice, enclosed in
an embroidered epistle, embellished with your misguidance, and
dispatched by your specious views. It is the letter of a man with no
perception to direct him and no guide to show him the way, a man who
answered the call of his passions, who was led by the reinsof
misguidance,adeliriousmanwhoramblesandblundersfromthepath. From the same
letter: The pledge of allegiance happens once. It is not open to
reconsideration or a second round of selection. One who breaks the
pledge is an aggressor, one who holds back and wavers is a traitor. 1
One of ʿAlī's earliest letters to Muʿāwiyah following the Battle of the
Camel, sent from Kufa to Damascus in 36/656 with Jarīr ibn ʿAbdallāh
al-Anṣārī. Full text and context in Minqarī, Waqʿat Ṣiffīn, 28--30.
Further details of Jarīr's embassy to Muʿāwiyah in Damascus as ʿAlī's
envoy, and related events and letters, in Ḥ3:74--91; Jarīr's prior
dealings with ʿAlī in Ḥ3:70--74. 2 The Sunni Muʿtazilī commentator
(Ḥ14:35) takes these lines to endorse the validity of the people
selecting a caliph. The Shiʿi commentators (B 787; R 3:18) say ʿAlī used
this argument here, rather than citing the Prophet's designation (naṣṣ)
of himself, because it was what his addressees were more likely to
accept. 3 Excerpt from letter in response to Muʿāwiyah's, (1) sent from
Kufa, while ʿAlī's envoy Jarīr was in Damascus in 36/656, persuading
Muʿāwiyah to give the pledge of allegiance to ʿAlī (Min- qarī, Waqʿat
Ṣiffīn, 57--58; Māmaṭīrī, Nuzhah, 300--303); and/or (2) written in
Ṣiffīn, toward the end of the battle, in 37/657 (Ḥ14:42--43, includes
text of Muʿāwiyah's letter, and ʿAlī's full response; B 788). al-Sharīf
