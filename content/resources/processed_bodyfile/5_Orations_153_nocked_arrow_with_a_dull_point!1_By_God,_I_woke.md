---
# Chapter 5: Orations 153 nocked arrow with a dull point!1 By God, I woke
this morning not trusting any- thing you say, not expecting your
support, not threatening the enemy with your strength. What is wrong
with you? What is your cure? What is your remedy? They are but men like
you! So much talk and no comprehension, so much rash- ness and no piety,
so much greed for things that don't belong to you! 1.30 From words ʿAlī
spoke about ʿUthmān's assassination:2 If I had commanded it, I would be
a killer. If I had forbidden it, I would be a supporter. In truth, the
supporter cannot claim that he is more righteous than the detractor,
while the detractor would not be correct in saying that the sup- porter
is more righteous than he is.3 Let me summarize the situation for you:
ʿUthmān misappropriated, and that was wrong. You responded with
violence, and that was also wrong. Both the one who misappropriated and
the one who responded with violence will face God's judgment. 1.31 From
words ʿAlī spoke just before the fighting began at the Battle of the
Camel, when he sent ʿAbdallāh ibn al-ʿAbbās to urge Zubayr to return to
the fold of obedience. ʿAlī said:4 Don't speak with Ṭalḥah, for you will
find him a bull with twisted horns, a man who rides a refractory beast
and swears it is docile. Speak instead with Zubayr, whose hump is
softer, and say to him:Your cousin ʿAlī says to you:You acknowl- edged
me in Medina and rejected me in Iraq---what turned you from what you
deemed good? Raḍī: ʿAlī was the first to use the expression, "What
turned you from what you deemed good?" (mā ʿadā mimmā badā). 1
"Broken-nocked," ( fūq, used here in the elative form, afwaq), is a
notch at the end of an arrow into which the bowstring fits. 2 On the
events leading up to ʿUthmān's killing in Medina in 35/656, see
Ḥ1:129--161. Raḍī tran- scribes this text among ʿAlī's orations, but Ibn
Ṭāwūs (Kashf, 174, 180) cites it as part of a lengthy epistle ʿAlī wrote
after Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr was killed in 38/658, which ʿAlī gave to
al-Aṣbagh ibn Nubātah et al., instructing them to have Ibn Abī Rāfiʿ
read it out every Friday in the Kufa mosque. The Sunni commentators are
at pains to point out that although ʿAlī did not pick up a sword to
defend ʿUthmān, he spoke out against his murder, even sending his sons
Ḥasan and Ḥusayn to guard ʿUthmān's door. Ḥ2:126; ʿA 98 n. 1. 3 "The
supporter" could be a reference to Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam, and "the
detractor" to ʿAbdal- lāh ibn Masʿūd. R 1:224. 4 Basra, 36/656. On
details of the conversation between ʿAbdallāh ibn al-ʿAbbās and Zubayr,
and related events at the Battle of the Camel, see Ḥ2:166--170. Zubayr
was the son of ʿAlī's paternal aunt, Ṣafiyyah bint ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib.

155 1.32 From an oration by ʿAlī:1 People! We live in a challenging age
and a difficult time, when the good are deemed evil, and oppressors grow
ever more brutal. We neither benefit from what we have learnt, nor ask
about what we don't know---we ignore calamities until they set up camp
in our homes. Men today fall into one of four categories: One is
prevented from spreading corruption on earth by the weakness of his
person, the dullness of his blade, and the sparseness of his wealth.
Another unsheathes his sword, announces his intention, and assembles
foot soldiers and cavalry, selling his soul and forfeiting his religion
to amass baubles, lead an army, or ascend a pulpit---what a terrible
transaction, when you deem the world an equitable price for your soul, a
fair exchange for heavenly reward! A third seeks worldly gain by
performing the deeds of the hereafter, rather than seeking the hereafter
by performing good deeds in this world; he appears calm in his person,
walks with slow steps, tucks up his garments, and presents himself as a
trustworthy man, taking advantage of the concealment offered by God's
veil to sin. A fourth is only prevented from seeking power by his own
ser- vility and lack of support---these are what keeps him in his place.
He wears the mark of contentment and dons the garment of renunciants,
but neither his haunts in the daytime nor his retreats in the night are
anything like theirs. Only a few men remain---their eyes are wet with
remembrance of the return to God, and their tears flow from fear of the
resurrection. One is a solitary fugitive, another is curbed by fear, a
third is shushed and muzzled, a fourth, sincere, prays, and a fifth is
bereaved and grieving. They are weakened by ter- ror and humiliated on
all sides; they drink from a bitter sea, tongues silenced,
heartswounded.Theygavecounseluntilexhausted,nowtheyarebeatendown; almost
all have been killed off, only a few remain. People, let this world be
smaller in your eyes than fibers of a spiny acacia pod, or fluffs of
wool float- ing off a pair of shears. Learn from the fate of those who
came before, let not those who come later have occasion to learn from
yours. Reject this world and
censureher,forshehasrejectedmanywhowerefarmoreenamoredof herthan you.
Raḍī: Some individuals who lack any knowledge attribute this oration to
Muʿāwiyah, when it is unquestionably the speech of the Commander of the
Faithful. Can one com- pare dirt to gold, or the bitter to the sweet?
Indeed, an experienced guide has shown 1 ʿAlī delivered this oration in
the Grand Mosque of Kufa, during his caliphate, 35--40/656--661, in the
presence of the community's leaders. Ibn Ṭalḥah, Maṭālib, 176. al-Sharīf

1: Orations 157 us the way, a discerning assayer has scrutinized it and
pronounced judgment: ʿAmr ibn Baḥr al-Jāḥiẓ, in his book, Eloquence and
Exposition (al-Bayān wa-l-tabyīn), mentions that certain people
attribute this oration to Muʿāwiyah, then he discusses the issue at some
length. This is the gist of Jāḥiẓ's comments: "These words resemble the
words of ʿAlī. They are closer to his style in categorizing people and
providing information about their state, describing them as beaten,
humiliated, fearful, and terrified. In con- trast, when did we ever see
Muʿāwiyah's speech follow the path of the renunciants and the way of the
worshippers!"1 1.33 FromanorationbyʿAlī,whenhemarchedonthepeopleof
Basra.ʿAbdallāhibnal- ʿAbbās narrated: I entered the Commander of the
Faithful's tent at Dhū Qār and found him mending his sandal. He asked
me, "What's the value of this sandal?" and, when I replied, "It's worth
nothing," he responded, "By God, it's worth more to me than com- mand
over you! That I undertake only to establish truth and fight falsehood!"
Then he went out and addressed the people in the following oration:2 God
sent Muḥammad when no Arab read scripture or claimed prophecy. He
shepherded them until he had brought them to a safe encampment, a place
of refuge, where their lances were straightened and the ground under
them madefirm.ByGod,Ialwaysfoughtinthefront,alwaysbattleduntiltheenemy's
battalions were repulsed and defeated, never holding back from weakness
or cowardice. This march is the same. I shall impale the demon of
falsehood until truth breaks out from its side. Heavens, why do the
Quraysh hate me so? By God, I fought them when they were unbelievers,
and I shall fight them now in this revolt. I brought them to their knees
then and shall do so again. 1 Jāḥiẓ, Bayān, 2:59--61. Attributed to
Muʿāwiyah in Ibn ʿAbd Rabbih, ʿIqd, 4:176. ʿAbd al-Zahrāʾ (Maṣādir,
1:418) argues in favor of the attribution to ʿAlī, based on Raḍī's and
Jāḥiẓ's remarks, and on the fact that the individual who supposedly
narrated the oration from Muʿāwiyah, Shuʿayb ibn Ṣafwān, is considered
an untrustworthy narrator (after Abū Ḥātim al-Rāzī and Ibn ʿAdī). 2 The
march culminated in the Battle of the Camel near Basra in
36/656---between the Caliph ʿAlī on one side, and the Prophet's widow
ʿĀʾishah, and the Prophet's CompanionsṬalḥah and Zubayr on the
other---in which ʿAlī won a decisive victory. This oration is also
narrated in a variant version, §1.101. Dhū Qār was a caravan stop east
of Kufa, in the direction of Wāsiṭ, where ʿAlī camped---on events there,
see Ḥ2:187--188---en route to the Battle of the Camel at Basra.
Alternatively, Mufīd (Irshād, 247) places the oration at Rabadhah, where
hajj pilgrims were also in the audience. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015)

159 1.34 From an oration by ʿAlī, as he mobilized his followers to fight
the Syrians:1 Shame! I am tired of rebuking you! Is it that you are
satisfied with this world in exchange for the hereafter? Is it that you
are happy with humiliation after having known strength and might? When I
call you to fight your enemy, you roll your eyes as though in the throes
of death, as if numb with strong drink. You struggle to find words and
appear mystified by what I say, pretending that your minds are addled
and that you grasped nothing. To the end of the long nights, never will
you be supporters in whom I can trust, or a column on which I can lean,
or allies on whom I can depend! You are like camels whose herder is at
his wits end---each time he gathers them from one side, they scatter
from another. God's life! What cowards you are when faced with the
flames of war! Your enemies conspire but you do not respond, your
boundaries contract but you feel no anger, your enemies never sleep but
you remain merrily oblivious. By God, the slothful will be crushed! By
God, I know that when battle blazes and death burns, you will split from
Abū Ṭālib's son as cleanly as a head sliced off a body. By God, how
powerless the man who lets his enemy eat his flesh, pound his bones, and
flay his skin! His ribs conceal a feeble heart! You be that person if
you wish. I, by God, shall strike a blow with my Mashrafī sword that
will crush skulls and sever limbs.Then God may do with me as he wills!
People! You have rights over me, and I have rights over you. I owe you
sincere coun- sel, generous stipends, teaching that dispels ignorance,
and lessons that make you better. You owe me fulfilment of your pledge
and sincere support in my presence and my absence. You must answer when
I call and obey when I com- mand. 1.35 From an oration by ʿAlī after the
arbitration:2 1 ʿAlī delivered this oration in Kufa, shortly after
defeating the Kharijites at Nahrawān. Ṭabarī, Tārīkh, 5:90--91. It is
his fourth post-Nahrawān oration attempting to muster his followers
against Muʿāwiyah---the first was at Nahrawān itself, the second at
Nukhaylah, near Kufa, the third immediately after reaching Kufa, and
this, the fourth, after a few days had passed in Kufa. Details of his
followers' responses at each of these events in B 239; Ḥ2:193--197. ʿAbd
al- Zahrāʾ(Maṣādir,2:192)arguesthatthisispartof

held back from marching on Muʿāwiyah. 2 Refers to the arbitration
(taḥkīm) between ʿAlī and Muʿāwiyah, after the Battle of Ṣiffīn, at the
hands of Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī and ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣat Dūmat al-Jandal, in

161 I praise God even though this age has brought a great calamity and
dealt a mighty blow. I testify that there is no god but God---there is
no god other than he. I testify that Muḥammad is his servant and
messenger---may God bless him and his descendants. And now to the matter
at hand:1 Disobeying a kind, learned, and experienced counselor yields
only regret and remorse. I gave you my considered opinion regarding this
arbitration, ⟨O if only Qaṣīr's command had been obeyed!⟩2 With
rebellious defiance you rejected my warnings, enough to make a
counsellor doubt his own counsel and a flint hold back its spark! In
this, you and I may be likened to the Hawāzin poet's lines:3 I gave you
my considered opinion At the place of the winding sands But you heeded
not my counsel Till forenoon the next day. 1.36 From an oration by ʿAlī
warning the people of Nahrawān:4 I warn you! Take heed or you will soon
be corpses strewn at the bend of this river in the hollows of this
plain, holding no mandate from your Lord or proof of righteousness, cast
out by your lands, and enmeshed in fate's deadly snare. I forbade you
from engaging in arbitration, but you challenged me with defi- ance and
insolence until I gave in to your reckless dictates. Lightheaded fools,
the lot of you! May you be deprived of fathers! I'm not the one who has
brought calamity on you, nor have I ever intended you harm. 1 "And now
to the matter at hand" (lit. "As for what comes after," ammā baʿdu), is
a standard phrase in the early Arabic oration, inserted between the
praise-and-benedictions formula and the body of the oration. 2 Proverb
referring to the treacherous death of the pre-Islamic Iraqi Azdī king
Jadhīmah ("the leper") ibn Mālik ibn Naṣr (fl. 3rd c. ad)---at the hands
of the Queen of Palmyra, Zenobia, whose father he had killed and whom he
had set out to wed---and the unheeded warnings of his wise counsellor
Qaṣīr ibn Saʿd al-Lakhmī. For details of the incident, see Maydānī,
Majmaʿ al-amthāl, 1:570--575 (under "khaṭb yasīr fī khaṭb kabīr"); R
1:243; B 243--244; Kawar, "D ̲ j̲ad̲h̲īma al-Abras̲h̲ or al-Waḍḍāḥ,"ei2; and
Shahid, "al-Zabbāʾ,"ei2. 3 Often cited proverbially, the verse is by
Durayd ibn al-Ṣimmah (Dīwān, 61) of the Hawāzin tribe, a famous poet and
warrior who lived mostly in the pre-Islamic period and is said to have
been killed at the age of a hundred fighting against Muḥammad in the
Battle of Ḥunayn in 8/630. The verse is from a poem lamenting Durayd's
deceased brother ʿAbdallāh, which begins: (أَرَث َ بْعَم ِّمُأ ْنِم ِلْبَ حلاُديِدَج
َ ّ دٖ .)R 1:243--244; B 244--245. 4 Nahrawān,eastof

and the Kharijites, and this oration was delivered in 38/658 before the

https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ Chapter 1: Orations
163 1.37 From an address by ʿAlī that resembles an oration:1 I answered
Muḥammad's call when others held back, sped forward when oth- ers
dragged their feet, and welcomed God's light when others hesitated. The
humblest in speech, I outpaced all in action. With the reins of religion
firmly in my hands, I flew like the wind, staking everything I
possessed, like a moun- tain that no gales could shake, no storms could
budge. No one can find fault or speak ill of me in any of this. In my
eyes, the weak were mighty as I strove to restore their rights, the
mighty were weak as I wrested from them the rights of the weak. I
accepted God's decree and bowed to his command. Do you think I
wouldlieregardingGod'sMessengerwhenIwasthefirsttosupporthim?Ishall not
be the first to lie about him! But when I paused to reflect on my
situation, I found that my obedience had preceded my oath of allegiance,
and my pledge was a shackle around my neck.2 1.38 From an oration by
ʿAlī: 1.38.1 Doubt is called doubt because it resembles truth.3 1.38.2
Certainty illumines the way for those who place their faith in God, and
the path of right guidance carries them forward, while the call of God's
ene- mies is the embodiment of error, and their guide is blindness
itself. You will not escape death just because you fear it. You will not
remain in this world just because you want to.4 1 The address was
delivered following the Battle of Nahrawān against the Kharijites in
Ṣafar
38/658.Ḥ1:284.Kulaynī(Kāfī,1:454--456)narratesthefirstparagraphasaposthumousaddress
in the second grammatical person, by an anonymous speaker to ʿAlī, just
after he died. 2 Multiple pronouns make this an ambiguous statement. The
majority interpretation is this: ʿAlī is saying that he was obliged to
obey the wishes of the Messenger who had commanded him to refrain from
raising his sword to seek his right. He was thus forced to give an oath
of
allegiancetotheearliercaliphs,forhispledgetotheMessengerwasashacklearoundhisneck
that stopped him from fighting for his right (Ḥ2:296; B 249; Gh 1:242).
A second interpretation is this: ʿAlī is saying that the people had been
commanded to render him obedience, a man- date that preceded their
actual oath of allegiance to him; their pledge to him was a shackle
around his neck, and he could not refuse to lead them (B 249). 3 The
line plays on the paronomasia ( jinās) between "doubt" (shubhah), and
"resemble" (tush- bih), both deriving from the root letters "Sh-B-H." 4
Some sources attribute the last two lines to ʿAlī's associate Mālik
al-Ashtar in the lead-up to the Battle of Ṣiffīn, in a speech he gave
following ʿAlī's speech, calling on the people to march
onMuʿāwiyah.Minqarī,WaqʿatṢiffīn,95;Iskāfī,

1: Orations 165 1.39 From an oration by ʿAlī:1 I am tested with
followers who do not obey my command or answer my call. May you be
deprived of fathers!What are you waiting for?Why do you not fight and
serve your Lord? Does no religion unite you, no outraged honor goad you
to action? I stand among you shouting till I'm hoarse, appealing to you
for suc- cor, but you hear not a word, not a single command.These events
are the result of your despicable behavior. No requital can be sought
with you at my side, no purpose achieved. When I summoned you to come to
your brothers' aid, you growled like a sullen camel with sores on its
chest, you plodded like a scraggy beast with lesions on its rump. The
few who came forward came limp and dithering, «as though driven to a
death they could see in front of their eyes.»2 Raḍī: By "dithering
(mutadhāʾib)," ʿAlī means: "jerkily," from the commonly used phrase,
"the wind dithered (tadhāʾabat al-rīḥ)," meaning, "it blew jerkily." It
is from this mean- ing---the jerkiness of its walk---that the wolf
(dhiʾb) is named. 1.40 From an address by ʿAlī when he heard the
Kharijites shout, ⟨No rule save God's!⟩:3 The statement is true, but the
intent is false. Yes, there is no authority save God's, but these people
are claiming that there should be no other ruler. In truth, the
community must have a ruler, whether pious or wicked, under whose
jurisdictionbelieversdogoodanddisbelieversmakemerry,tillGodbringseach
period to its destined conclusion. Taxes need to be collected, enemies
repudi- ated, highways protected, and rights wrested from the mighty for
the weak---all this, until the pious ruler goes to his rest, or the
wicked ruler's death allows the community to rest. 1 ʿAlī delivered this
address in Kufa following the raid by Muʿāwiyah's commander, Nuʿmān ibn
Bashīr al-Anṣārī, on ʿAyn al-Tamr, west of the Euphrates, on the
frontier between Syria and Iraq, in 39/659 (Ḥ1:301; B 250; see events of
the raid in Ḥ1:301--306; Zetterstéen, "al-Nuʿmān b. Bas̲h̲īr,"ei2; see
also §1.66, delivered at around the same time). Some lines are
transcribed by Ṭabarī (Tārīkh, 5:107) within an oration ʿAlī delivered
chastising the Kufans for not respond- ing to his call to mobilize in
aid of Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr, who was killed by ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ in Egypt
in 38/658. 2 Qurʾan, Anfāl 8:6. 3 Ar. Lā ḥukma illā li-llāh. ʿAlī was
preaching in the mosque in Kufa, in 37/657, soon after the Battle of
Ṣiffīn, when he was interrupted by a group of Kharijites shouting this
slogan, and he responded with the words at hand (Balādhurī, Ansāb,
2:404; Shāfiʿī, Umm, 4:229; Ṭabarī, Tārīkh, 5:72--73; see the events
surrounding the Kharijites' use of this slogan, and ʿAlī's attempts to
conciliate them before the Battle of Nahrawān, in Ḥ2:310--312). The
first Kharijite to utter the slogan was Burak (or al-Ḥajjāj) ibn
ʿAbdallāh al-Tamīmī, who later conspired with the Kharijites Ibn Muljam
and ʿAmr ibn Bakr to assassinate ʿAlī, Muʿāwiyah, and ʿAmr ibn al- ʿĀṣ;
Ibn Muljam killed ʿAlī, but the other two attempts failed, and all three
conspirators were immediately executed (R 1:252). See also §1.182 and
§3.182. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -
