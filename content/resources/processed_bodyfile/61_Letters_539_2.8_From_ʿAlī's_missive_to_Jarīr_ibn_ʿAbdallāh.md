# Chapter 61: Letters 539 2.8 From ʿAlī's missive to Jarīr ibn ʿAbdallāh
al-Bajalī, his emissary to Muʿāwiyah:1 When you receive my letter, tell
Muʿāwiyah that he must take a final deci- sion and give a binding
response. Then ask him to choose between a war that displaces or a
settlement that disgraces. If he chooses war, then dissolve the covenant
of peace and fling that threat at him. If he chooses to settle, then
make him give me the pledge of allegiance. Go in peace. 2.9 From ʿAlī's
letter to Muʿāwiyah:2 Our tribe decided to kill our Prophet and
extirpate our root. They came at us with evil intentions and spiteful
actions, denying us the sweetness of life, throwing over us a blanket of
fear, forcing us into the rugged mountains, and kindling the flames of
war. But God willed that we should protect the enclosure of
hisreligionandshielditssanctityfrompiercingarrows.Thoseof uswhowere
believers did so in the hope of God's reward, and those who were
unbelievers acted in defense of their kin. Muslims from other clans of
Quraysh---protected by a pact or by kin---were not exposed to our
hardships but were protected from lethal assault. Whenever red flames of
battle blazed, moreover, whenever the Muslims drew back in fear, the
Messenger would send men of his own fam- ily to the front, and, through
them, he would shield his Companions from the heat of swords and spears.
ʿUbaydah ibn al-Ḥārith was killed at the Battle of Badr, Ḥamzah was
killed at the Battle of Uḥud, Jaʿfar was killed at the Battle of Muʾtah.
Another man---and I could name him if I wished---sought to attain
martyrdom just as they did, but their deaths were decreed early, while
his was deferred.3 What a strange age we live in, when I am placed on
the same level as men who have not raced out in front, who do not
possess my precedence! If any man were to make this, or any similar
claim, they would be claiming a status I do not recognize, nor, I
believe, does God. But God deserves praise in every situation. You
demand that ʿUthmān's killers be handed over---I have looked 1 From Kufa

541 into the matter and have concluded that I am unable to hand them
over to you, or to anyone else. By my life, if you do not desist in your
deceit and dissent, you will very soon see those same men seeking you
out, saving you the trouble of seeking them out on land, or sea, or
mountains, or plains. Your search will end badly---these are visitors
you will not enjoy meeting. Peace to the deserv- ing. 2.10 From another
letter sent by ʿAlī to Muʿāwiyah:1 How will you fare when the robes with
which this world adorns herself, with whose beauty she has ensnared you,
are stripped off? She called, and you answered, she led, and you
followed, she commanded, and you obeyed. Very soon, you will face
something no shield can protect you from. Stand down from this path,
gather provisions for the final reckoning, roll up your sleeves to
prepare for life's imminent end, and do not give ear to the wicked.
Desist, or let me inform you about your own situation, a situation that
you appear not to know: You live a life of excess. Satan has had his way
with you, he has achieved his fullest hopes of you, and he now moves
inside you as your own blood and spirit. When were your family ever
rulers of the people, Muʿāwiyah, or guardians of the community's
affairs?You can claim no high honor there, no winning horse! We should
all seek refuge in God from clinging to the stakes of wretchedness! I
give you warning: Cease to be deceived by false hopes. Cease to hide
intentions that differ from your speech. You call me to war, do you?
Leave the people out of this and take the field! Meet me yourself and
spare our armies the killing! Let it be known to all which of us
possesses a blinded heart and blindfolded eyes!2 I am Abū Ḥasan, who
killed your grandfather, your uncle, and your brother in the Battle of
Badr with the cutting blow of my sword---that

enemy!3 I have not changed my religion or adopted a new prophet. I walk
the path that you abandoned so willingly, that you had joined only under

Similar lines in §2.64. 2 "Blinded heart" is a reference to Qurʾan,
Muṭaffifūn 83:14. 3 Ar. anā Abū Ḥasan (I am Ḥasan's father), i.e., I am
ʿAlī; it was common to refer to use a fil- ionymic ("father of X") to
address individuals; see also §2.18. At the Battle of Badr, ʿAlī had
killed Muʿāwiyah's maternal grandfather, ʿUtbah ibn Rabīʿah, his
maternal uncle Walīd ibn ʿUtbah, and his brother Ḥanẓalah ibn Abī

543 pulsion.1 You claim to seek vengeance for ʿUthmān---you know well
who was responsible for shedding ʿUthmān's blood, so seek vengeance
there if you wish! I can see you now, mauled by battle, screaming like a
camel grumbling under a heavy load. I can see your faction panicked by
unrelenting sword strikes, by the descent of fate, by death after death,
inviting me, ironically, to follow the Qurʾan's judgment, while you
yourselves are unbelieving deniers, or men who swore allegiance then
broke the pledge!2 2.11 From ʿAlī's instructions to a battalion he had
dispatched against the enemy:3 When you reach the enemy, or when they
reach you, set up camp just before the high ground, or on the foothills
of a mountain, or at the bend of a river, so these can serve as
protection and barrier. Attack from a single side or from two at most.
Place sentries on the horns of mountains and the shoulders of
knolls---the enemy should not be able to take you by surprise, whether
from a side you fear or even one you think is secure. Know that the eyes
of the army are its vanguard, and the eyes of its vanguard are its
scouts. Don't split up into separate groups---stay together when you set
up camp and stay together when you set off. When night descends, place
your spears in a circle around you and sip the cup of sleep only from
time to time. 2.12 From ʿAlī's instructions to Maʿqil ibn Qays
al-Riyāḥī, when he dispatched him to Syria at the head of a
three-thousand-man vanguard:4
FearGod,whomyoumustmeet,andbeyondwhomyouhavenogoal.Fightonly those who
fight you. March during the two cooler periods of the day, alight at
noon so your men can rest, and drive your camels at a comfortable pace.
Don't march in the first part of the night, for God has made it a time
for repose and ordained it as a time of quiet and calm, not as a time
for marching---so rest your body and your mounts. Then, when you rise at
the spread of dawn, at the 1

the main army would meet up with him. Minqarī,Waqʿat Ṣiffīn, 148--149; B

545 break of day, march forward with God's blessing. When you meet the
enemy, stand at the center of your men. Don't allow your army to draw so
near to the enemy that they fear you are on the verge of battle, but
don't stay so far away
fromthemthattheythinkyoufeartheirattack.Waitonmyfurtherorders.Don't let
their insults incite you to begin the fight before you have called on
them to make peace and exhausted your pleas. 2.13 From ʿAlī's missive to
two of his army commanders:1 I have appointed Mālik ibn al-Ḥārith
al-Ashtar over both of you and over all those under your command. Listen
to him and obey his orders, consider him your armor and shield. He is a
person from whom neither weakness nor error is to be feared---he will
not delay when speed is of the essence, nor hasten when measured steps
are called for. 2.14 From ʿAlī's instructions to his army just before
confronting the enemy at Ṣiffīn:2 Don't attack them unless they attack
you first. Praise God, you already pos- sess proof of righteousness, and
waiting until they begin the fighting will be yet another proof against
them and in your favor. If we defeat the enemy--- and with God's
permission, we shall!---then don't kill those who flee, don't strike the
unarmed, and don't bear down on the wounded. Don't threaten or hurt
women, even if they insult your honor or abuse your leaders, for women
are weak in strength, spirit, and mind, and we were commanded not to
hurt them even when they were unbelievers. Even in the Age of Ignorance,
if a man struck a woman with as much as a pebble or a small stick, he
was held in shame for his act evermore, and so too were his descendants
after him. 2.15 ʿAlī would offer this supplication whenever he met his
enemy on the battlefield:3 God, it is to you that our hearts flow, our
necks stretch, our eyes are raised, and
ourfeetmove.Itisfromtheswiftnessof ourjourneytoyouthatourbodieshave 1
The two commanders are Ziyād ibn al-Naḍr and Shurayḥibn Hānī, whom ʿAlī
sent from Kufa, at the head of his 12,000-strong vanguard, to Syria in
36/657 (see also §2.11 earlier, and §2.56 later, addressed to them). En
route, the vanguard encountered a Syrian contingent under Abū al-Aʿwar
al-Sulamī. They wrote for help to ʿAlī, who responded by sending Mālik.

Minqarī, Waqʿat Ṣiffīn, 152--155; Ṭabarī, Tārīkh, 4:566--567 (letter at

battle-ethics speech ahead of any mil- itary conflict. B 795. Minqarī,
Waqʿat Ṣiffīn, 203--204; Ṭabarī, Tārīkh, 5:10--11. 3 Prayer at Ṣiffīn,

547 become emaciated.1 God, buried rancor has surfaced today, and
cauldrons of malice simmer. God, we complain to you of our Prophet's
death, our enemies' numbers, and our community's implosion. «Lord,
decide between us and our tribesmen with truth, for you are the best
conqueror.»2 2.16 ʿAlī would give his supporters these instructions
ahead of battle:3 Don't hesitate to retreat then assail, to withdraw
then attack. Give your swords their due. Think of the place where your
body may fall as your home. Prepare
yourframesforpiercingspear-throwsandpowerfulsword-strikes.Deadenyour
voices, for this will drive out your fear. I swear by him who split the
grain and created the soul---your enemies have never really accepted
Islam! They had to surrender but concealed their unbelief. When they
found supporters, they revealed it again. 2.17 From ʿAlī's letter
replying to Muʿāwiyah:4 You demand Syria, but I'm not about to give you
today what I refused you yes- terday. We are not equal in war and
men---you in your state of doubt don't possess sharper perception than I
do in my certainty, and the people of Syria don't covet this world more
than the people of Iraq covet the hereafter.You say, "We are all sons of
ʿAbd Manāf"---yes, we are, but Umayyah is not the equal of Hāshim, Ḥarb
is not the equal of ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib, Abū Sufyān is not the equal of Abū
Ṭālib, the Emigrant is not like the Freedman,5 the purebred is not like
the adopted, the righteous is not like the falsifier, and the believer
is not like the closet antagonist! The worst son is one who follows his
forebears into the Fire of Gehenna! Our hands possess the honor of

Islam, some willingly and some by force, you were among those who did so
out of greed or fear. By that
time,thetruewinnershadalreadyattainedprecedence,andthefirstEmigrants had
already won distinction. Don't let Satan have a share in you, Muʿāwiyah,
don't show him a way to control your soul. 2.18 From ʿAlī's missive to
ʿAbdallāh ibn al-ʿAbbās, his governor in Basra:1 Know that Basra is
where Iblīs landed after his fall from grace and where the trees of
sedition have taken root, so tame its people with kindness and unravel
from their heart the knot of fear. It has reached me that you have
castigated the Tamīm tribesmen and spoken with them harshly. Know that
no star of Tamīm has ever set except that another has risen in its
place, and no one has dared to attack them either in the Age of
Ignorance or since the coming of Islam. They are our intimate kin and
our close relations---we shall be rewarded for fostering their bonds and
incur sin if we sever them. Exercise restraint, Abū al- ʿAbbās2---may
God have mercy on you!---in whatever flows from your hand or your
tongue, be it good or bad, for we are partners in this endeavor. Behave
as I hope you will behave, and don't make me change my opinion of you.
Go in peace. 2.19 From ʿAlī's missive to one of his governors:3 The
Dihqān landowners in your province have complained of your harshness,
strictness, contempt, and ill-treatment.4 I have looked into this
matter, and although I find them unworthy of being your close associates
because of their polytheism, yet they certainly do not deserve to be
alienated or to be treated harshly, for they have entered into our
compact. In dealing with them, wear a soft garment with an edge of
toughness, and alternate between strictness and compassion. Mix intimacy
and closeness with remoteness and reserve.You will do this, God willing.
1 Presumably from Kufa, soon after the Battle of the Camel in 36/656.
During that battle, the loyalties of the Tamīm tribe of Basra had been
divided, and many had fought against ʿAlī. Afterward, when ʿAlī
appointed Ibn al-ʿAbbās governor of Basra, Ibn al-ʿAbbās was harsh with
the Tamīm for this reason. Details and ʿAlī's full letter in B 801. 2

2: Letters 551 2.20 From ʿAlī's missive to Ziyād ibn Abīhi, who was
acting as deputy for ʿAlī's gover- nor ʿAbdallāh ibn al-ʿAbbās in Basra.
ʿAbdallāh was then ʿAlī's governor in Basra and he also had jurisdiction
over the provinces of Ahwaz, Fars, and Kirman.1 I swear this by God, in
all truth: If I hear that you have misappropriated funds from the
Muslims' treasury, whether it be a small or a large amount, I shall
inflict on you a harsh punishment that will leave you short of wealth,
dimin- ished in strength, and burdened with shame. Go in peace. 2.21
From another missive sent by ʿAlī to Ziyād:2 Turn from extravagance to
moderation, think today of tomorrow, and spend what you must, but put by
the rest for your day of want. Do you expect God to remunerate you with
the humble if he counts you among the arrogant? Do you think he will
reward you with the charitable when you wallow in luxu- ries and refuse
to help the weak and the widowed? A man is recompensed for the work he
has accomplished. He advances to meet what he sent on. Go in peace. 2.22
From ʿAlī's letter to ʿAbdallāh ibn al-ʿAbbās. Ibn al-ʿAbbās used to
say: After the words of the Prophet, I have benefited from no words as
much as I have benefited from these:3 1 Presumably sent from Kufa to
Fars sometime in 37--38/657--658: Yaʿqūbī (Tārīkh, 2:204) pref- aces
this missive with the words, "\[ʿAlī\] wrote to Ziyād, his governor in
Fars"; Ziyād was appointed as governor there after Ṣiffīn, which was in
37/657. This text is an escalation from the earlier, relatively milder
reproof against corruption in §2.21. 2
PresumablyalsofromKufa,butearlierthan§2.20,in36/657,inthelead-uptotheBattleof
Ṣif- fīn, when ʿAbdallāh ibn al-ʿAbbās left his post to join ʿAlī for
preparations. ʿAlī had dispatched his freedman Saʿd to Ziyād,
instructing him to send funds to him in Kufa from the treasury of Basra;
they argued, and, presumably, Ziyād did not send the funds, which is
what prompted ʿAlī's reply. Details of the context, ʿAlī's full missive,
and Ziyād's reply, in Balādhurī, Ansāb, 2:164--165; Ḥ16:196--197, within
the commentary on §2.44. 3 Excerpt from a letter---of which §2.66 is a

Basra treasury, arguing that as a member of the Prophet's family, he had
a right to the Qurʾanic "fifth" (khums) share. When ʿAlī chastised him,
he retracted his claim and returned the money. Text and context for
§2.22 and §2.66 in Yaʿqūbī, Tārīkh, 2:205. The commentators also discuss
the episode under §2.41, which includes explicit mention of the affair:
Ḥ16:169--172; B 867, includes ʿAbdallāh's reply, and ʿAlī's further
reply; details are also given in Balādhurī, Ansāb, 2:169--176; Rāwandī
(R 3:134--135) argues---contra the other commentators---that the
reference is more likely to ʿAbdallāh's brother ʿUbaydallāh ibn al-
ʿAbbās. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -
