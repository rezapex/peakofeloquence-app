# Chapter 9: Orations 179 You taunt, "All these excuses to avoid death!"
By God, I care not whether I con- front death or death confronts me! You
mock, "Or perhaps you hesitate to fight the Syrians?" By God, I would
not delay battle even by a day, were it not for the hope that a few may
yet return, to be guided by me, and---although their sight is weak!---to
discern my light.This would please me more than killing them for their
errant ways, notwithstanding they would die yoked to their sins. 1.55
From an address by ʿAlī:1 We fought in support of God's Messenger and
killed our fathers, our sons, our
brothers,andouruncles,2allthewhileincreasinginfaithandacceptance,com-
mitment to the true path, endurance in the face of stinging pain, and
intensity in fighting the enemy. A warrior from our side and another
from the enemy would clash like two stallions to the death, each
attempting to steal the other's life, each offering the other fate's
cup.3 Ours would win in one combat, theirs would prevail in another.
When God saw our true courage, he crushed our
enemyindefeatandsentustriumphantvictory.SowasIslamfounded.Thusdid it
rest its withers and settle into its stall. I swear on my life! If we
had behaved like you, religion would never have been established, belief
would never have blossomed. I swear God's oath! You shall squeeze
calamity's udders and find blood in your pail.4 You shall be dogged
forever by regret. 1.56 From ʿAlī's address to his followers:5 1 ʿAlī
gave this address to his followers, either at Ṣiffīn in 37/657, when
many of his troops, despite being close to winning, pressed him to
accept Muʿāwiyah's truce (B 273), or a year later in Kufa, when
Muʿāwiyah's commander ʿAbdallāh ibn al-Ḥaḍramī attacked neighboring
Basra (Ḥ4:34--53). It is also possible that he spoke similar lines on
more than one occasion. 2 In the Battle of Badr, for example, Ḥamzah ibn
ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib fought and killed Muʿāwi- yah's paternal cousin, who
was also from Ḥamzah's tribe, Shaybah ibn Rabīʿah, and ʿUmar ibn
al-Khaṭṭāb fought and killed his own maternal uncle Hishām ibn
al-Mughīrah. Ḥ4:34. 3 In variousearly battles,for
example,ʿAlīsinglehandedly fought and killed the knownwarriors Walīd ibn
ʿUtbah, Ṭalḥah ibn Abī Ṭalḥah, and ʿAmr ibn ʿAbd Wadd. Ḥ4:34. 4
"Milkingblood"isametaphorforthepainfulresultsof thefailureof
ʿAlī'ssupporterstoanswer his call. B 274; Gh 1:305. 5 "The man with a
large maw" is probably Muʿāwiyah, who was a glutton, or, less likely,
Ziyād ibn Abīhi, Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf, or al-Mughīrah ibn Shuʿbah (R
1:276--277; B 275; Ḥ4:54). The full text is narrated by Nuʿaym (Fitan,
1:164) from the Prophet via ʿAlī, and it names the man as Muʿāwiyah. The
second half is placed by Kulaynī (Kāfī, 2:219) on the pulpit of the Kufa
mosque, while it is transcribed by Kūfī (Manāqib, 2:64) as a tag to a
response to a merchant from whom ʿAlī had purchased a shirt. al-Sharīf

181 After me, you will be ruled by a man with a large maw and a massive
belly who swallows all that is in front of him and demands everything
else besides. Kill him! But no, you won't. Listen to me! He will command
you to curse me with vile names and disassociate from me.1 Call me names
if you must---it will be a purge for me and save your life. But never
disassociate from me, for I was born in a pure state of nature,2 and was
the first to believe and migrate.3 1.57 From ʿAlī's address to the
Kharijites:4 May you be wiped out by sandstorms! May your date palms
wither untended! Are you saying I should testify against myself and
confess unbelief? This, after believing in God and fighting alongside
his messenger! «I should stray from the path if so, no longer among the
guided.»5 Return to the hole that you came from! Turn on your heels and
retreat! After me, you face complete humiliation and a cutting sword.
Indeed, despots will make it their custom to attack you and plunder.6
Raḍī: In his line, "May your date palms wither untended (wa-lā baqiya
minkum ābir)," the word ābir, when transmitted with an R, refers to a
person who tends (yaʾburu) date palms, i.e., cultivates them. Another
transmission is "one who narrates a tale (āthir)," i.e., recounts and
transmits it. The latter, in my opinion, is the most viable option.
Accordingly, ʿAlī is saying, "May not one of you remain to carry forward
your report." Yet another transmission is "one who jumps (ābiz)" with a
Z,7 meaning someone who leaps. A dying man is also called ābiz. 1 Ibn
Abī al-Ḥadīd discusses the Umayyads' commanding people to curse ʿAlī,
often on penalty of death, in three full chapters. Ḥ4:56--114; see also
B 275--276. For additional reports and ref- erences, see Qutbuddin,
Arabic Oration, 85--86. 2 Ar. ʿalā l-fiṭrah, meaning he was born Muslim.
The usage derives from the Prophetic hadith, "Every child is born in the
natural form (كلّ مولود يولد على الفطرة ---)it is his parents who raise
him Christian or Jewish." ʿAlī was "raised by the Prophet in the light
of Islam." Ḥ4:114--116; R 1:277--278; B 275--276. 3 Muslims consider
early conversion and migration a source of honor, indicating dedication
to the Prophet, and participation in setting up the nascent religion. On
ʿAlī being the first male to accept Islam and to migrate with the
Prophet from Mecca to Medina, see Ḥ4:116--128. 4 In Nahrawān, 38/658
(Ṭabarī, Tārīkh, 5:84). Yaʿqūbī (Tārīkh, 2:193) places these lines in an
oration ʿAlī delivered immediately upon his return to Kufa after
Nahrawān, addressing his supporters. 5 Qurʾan, Anʿām 6:56. 6 Details of
Umayyad-era Kharijite leaders and battles in Ḥ4:132--278, 5:80--129. 7
Both Z and R have the same shape in Arabic orthography, but Z ()زhas a
dot on top, and R ()ر is undotted. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and

1: Orations 183 1.58 1.58.1 When ʿAlī expressed his resolve to fight the
Kharijites, he was told, "They have already crossed the river at Jisr
al-Nahrawān," and he declared:1 Their deaths are written on this side of
the clear water. By God, not ten of them will survive, and not ten of
you will be killed. Raḍī: By "clear water (nuṭfah)," he means the water
of the river, an eloquent metaphor for water, even in large quantities.
1.58.2 Following the battle with the Kharijites, ʿAlī was told, "Every
man among them has been killed," and he declared: No, by God!They hide
in the loins of men and the wombs of women. But when- ever a horn
protrudes from their head, it will be cut off,2 and the last of them
will be thieves and brigands. 1.58.3 ʿAlī also said about them:3 Do not
fight the Kharijites after me, for those who seek right but miss it are
not like those who seek wrong and find it. Raḍī: He means Muʿāwiyah and
his associates. 1.59 From ʿAlī's address, when warned of assassination:4
I am protected by God's shield. When my day comes, it will leave and
hand me over. Then, the arrow will not miss, and the wound will not
heal. 1 Jisr al-Nahrawān (The Bridge of Nahrawān) is the same as
Nahrawān (present-day Sifwah), a town east of the Tigris River in Iraq,
the location of the Battle of Nahrawān between ʿAlī and the Kharijites
in 38/658. For details of the place and the battle, see Morony,
"al-Nahrawān," ei2. 2 "Horn" (qarn) is interpreted as leader, and a horn
protruding is a metaphor for the emergence of a leader. B 277; R 1:283;
Ḥ5:73. 3 ʿAlī spoke these words after the Battle of Nahrawān in 38/658.
Ṣadūq, ʿIlal, 218. 4 It is narrated that Ibn Muljam, the Kharijite who
would shortly assassinate ʿAlī, had revealed his intention in Kufa. When
people urged ʿAlī to act, he refused, saying that Ibn Muljam had not yet
perpetrated the crime; then he spoke the words in the text at hand,
thus, in Kufa, in 40/661. B 278--279. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015)
