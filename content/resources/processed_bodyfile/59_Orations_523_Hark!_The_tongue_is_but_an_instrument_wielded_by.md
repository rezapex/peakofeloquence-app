# Chapter 59: Orations 523 Hark! The tongue is but an instrument wielded by
men.1 Words do not come to it when a man feels constrained, nor does it
hesitate to produce speech when its owner feels at ease. Indeed, it is
we, the Prophet's family, who are the princes of language.2 It is in us
that its roots are fixed, upon us that its branches dangle.
Knowthis,mayGodhavemercyonyou!Youliveinanagewhenupholdersof right are
few, tongues are blunted against truth, and champions of justice are
shamed. People in this age practice incessant disobedience and shake
hands on treason.Their youth are violent, their old are sinners, their
scholars are hyp- ocrites, and their Qurʾan-readers are two-faced. Their
young do not respect the old, their rich do not care for the poor. 1.231
From ʿAlī's address explaining why people differ. Yamānī3 narrated this
report from Aḥmad ibn Qutaybah, who narrated it from ʿAbdallāh ibn Mālik
ibn Dajnah,4 who said: We were with the Commander of the Faithful when
the talk turned to differences among people, and he said: What
differentiates them is the source of their clay, for they are fragments
from saline or sweet soil, and from hard or smooth earth.They resemble
one another based on the closeness of their soil and diverge in
accordance with its differ- ence. A person may have perfect features but
an imperfect mind, or be tall in stature but short in aspiration, or
have beautiful deeds but an ugly appearance, or he may have little depth
yet be able to sense a great deal, or his temper could be good while his
traits are bad, or his heart could be lost while his wits are also
scattered, or he could possess an eloquent tongue as well as a strong
heart. 1.232 From an address ʿAlī delivered as he conducted the
Messenger's funeral ablu- tions and prepared his body for burial:5 May
my father and mother give their lives for you! Your death has cut short
what the death of no other has: prophecy, divine reports, and accounts
of the heavens. You brought some of us so close that you comforted us
against the loss of anyone else, yet you were there for all---all people
were equal in your 1 Ar. baḍʿah, lit. "part" or "piece," translated here

525 eyes.1 If you had not commanded us to be patient in adversity or
forbidden outpourings of grief, we would have used up all the tears in
our eyes weeping over you, and our ailment would be chronic, our grief
would endure---and yet both would be sorely inadequate! But enough!
Death cannot be fended off or rebuffed. May my father and mother be your
ransom, O Messenger! Remember us to your Lord and keep us in your
thoughts. Additional Orations2 1.233 From an address by ʿAlī in which he
narrated what all he did after the Prophet's migration until he caught
up with him:3 I began to follow the path taken by God's Messenger and
continued to tread the foot- steps of his reports until I reached ʿArj.
Raḍī: This is a passage from a long address by ʿAlī. His words, "I
continued to tread the footsteps of his reports (aṭaʾu dhikrahu),"
strike the targets of eloquence and pithiness both. He means that "I
kept receiving word of God's Messenger from when I started out until I
reached this location." He expressed this meaning through this marvelous
allusion. 1.234 From an oration by ʿAlī discussing the two arbitrators
and censuring the Syri- ans:4 They are uncouth riffraff and vile
bondsmen gathered from every shore and gleaned from every rabble, who
need to be taught, disciplined, instructed, trained, supervised, and
restricted in their doings. They belong neither to the Emigrants nor the
Allies who made their homes in Medina. Hark and listen! The Syrians have
selected the person who is closest to what they love, while you have
selected the person who is closest to what you hate. You have
experienced ʿAbdallāh ibn Qays (Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī)! Just yesterday, he
was saying to you, "This is sedition---cut your bowstrings and sheathe
your swords!" If he was right then, he is wrong in marching with us
today, but if he was wrong then---and he was---he deserves to be viewed
with suspicion. Strike ʿAmr ibn 1 I have translated this differently
than Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd and Baḥrānī (Ḥ13:24--25; B 682), who state that
"making special (khaṣaṣta)" and "making common (ʿamamta)" both refer to
the grief of the Prophet's passing: with their interpretation, I find
the next phrase---"that you comforted us against the loss of any
other"---difficult to understand. Rāwandī (R 2:415) states that the two
phrases refer to the manner of the Prophet's life and death. 2 An
additional six orations---perhaps added by Raḍī, or by others---are
transcribed in some of our primary and secondary manuscripts (further
details in the Edition's footnotes, and in Note on the Edition and
Translation) 3 Details of ʿAlī's role in Muḥammad's migration in B 778;
Ḥ13:303--306, after Ibn Isḥāq, Mag- hāzī. 4 Presumably in Ṣiffīn, in
37/657, after the Syrians asked for arbitration. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

527 al-ʿĀṣin the chest with ʿAbdallāh ibn al-ʿAbbās! Take advantage of
the respite granted by these days and protect the borders of Islam!
Don't you see your lands under attack, your ramparts under siege? 1.235
From an oration by ʿAlī in which he speaks of the Prophet's family: They
are the life of knowledge and the death of ignorance. Their forbearance
stems from their knowledge, and their silence from the wisdom of their
speech. They never go against what is right and never differ in it. They
are the pillars of Islam and the doors to the halls of protection. It is
through them that right has returned to its home, wrong has been
displaced from its residence, and its tongue has been excised at the
root. They have assimilated religion with understanding and mindful
attention, not by rote learning and narration. There are many narrators
of hadith,1 but those who tend to it mindfully are rare. 1.236 From an
oration by ʿAlī: Act while you still possess the breath of life, while
registers are open and repentance is extended, while one who turns away
is invited back and one who sins is asked to desist, before action is
extinguished, the respite is cut short, the interlude ends, the door of
repentance is shut, and the angels ascend. Let each man gather
provisions by himself, for himself, by the self that is living for the
self that will soon be dead, by the self that will perish for the self
that will remain, by the self that will depart, for the self that will
abide. Such a man fears God during his allotted span, while he is given
time to act. Such a man places a bridle and halter on his sentient soul.
He curbs it with this bridle from acts of disobedience to God and leads
it with the halter toward acts of obedience to God. 1.237 From an
address by ʿAlī urging his supporters to jihad:2 God has required you to
thank him, given you his command, and a lengthy respite to prepare for
the race so that you may compete and win. Tighten your belts and lose
your belly fat, for resolve and feasting never come together. How
completely does sleep destroy resolutions made in the day! How
completely does darkness erase the memory of high aspirations! 1 Lit.
"knowledge," ʿilm; in early Islamic times, the word usually referred to
religious knowledge, and often specifically to the Prophet Muḥammad's
teachings. 2 Presumably in Kufa, after the arbitration in 37/658.
