# Chapter 18: Orations 249 1.93 From an oration by ʿAlī: Praise God! He is
the first---there was nothing before him. He is the last---there is
nothing after him. He is the manifest---there is nothing above him. He
is the hidden---there is nothing below him. From the same oration
describing God's Messenger: Muḥammad came from the worthiest repository
and the noblest roots, from themineof honorandthecradleof
soundness.Virtuousheartsinclinedtohim, and discerning eyes were drawn.
Rancorous intentions were buried because of
him,andburningflamesweredoused.Brotherswerereconciledandpeerswere
separated, servility was converted to might and might was rendered
servile. His words were the epitome of elucidation, his very silence was
eloquent. 1.94 From an address by ʿAlī:1 1.94.1 God may have granted the
tyrant a reprieve, but he will surely appre- hend him. He lies in wait
on the road along which the tyrant must pass, in the place where his
saliva, dripping into his throat, will choke him. By the one who holds
my life in his hand, I swear that this faction will overpower you---not
because they have a greater right, but because they hasten to support
their leader's unrighteous claim,2 while you hold back from supporting
my right! Other communities fear tyranny from their rulers, while I have
come to fear tyranny from my subjects! I urge you to fight, but you
don't respond, I speak to you, but you don't listen, I call on you in
private and in public, but you don't answer, I counsel you, but you
don't accept my counsel. Those present among you are like those absent,
and servants behave like masters. I recite litanies of wisdom to you but
you bolt from them, I counsel you with profound advice but you scatter
in its wake, I urge you to fight these treacherous people, but before I
reach the end of my speech you ⟨disperse like the hands of Sabā⟩3---you
1 In Nukhaylah, just outside Kufa, after the arbitration in 37/658. A
few lines are repeated in §3.254, that specifies the location. Mufīd
(Irshād, 277) cites it as part of an oration which begins "O people of
Kufa, start preparations for fighting your enemy Muʿāwiyah and his sup-
porters." ʿAbd al-Zahrāʾ (Maṣādir, 2:192) argues that this text is part
of §1.34, delivered after Nahrawān when the Kufans held back from
marching on Muʿāwiyah. 2 The reference is to the Syrians, the Umayyads,
and Muʿāwiyah. Ḥ7:72; B 403; R 1:431. 3 The reference is to the proverb,
⟨They dispersed like the hands of Sabā (Sheba)⟩(tafarraqū aydiya Sabā),
i.e., they dispersed never to be reunited again. Sabā was a pre-Islamic
man from Yemen. His hands are a metaphor for his sons who, warned by a
sybil of the Maʾrib dam's imminent rupture and flooding, dispersed
widely across the Arabian Peninsula. Maydānī, Majmaʿ al-amthāl, 2:6--8;
Ḥ7:74--75; B 403; R 1:432. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera
