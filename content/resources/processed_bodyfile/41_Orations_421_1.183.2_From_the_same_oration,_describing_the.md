# Chapter 41: Orations 421 1.183.2 From the same oration, describing the
wondrous creation of many species of animals: Had they contemplated the
greatness of his power and the vastness of his bounty, they would have
returned to the Path, and feared the punishment of the Fire. But hearts
are sickly and eyes diseased. Do they not observe the small- est of
things he has created, how he has perfected its creation, refined its
form, provided orifices for hearing and sight, and fashioned bones and
skin? Observe the ant in its tiny frame and delicate shape! It can
hardly be spotted by the eye or grasped by the mind, yet see how it
crawls on the earth and guards its food, transporting a single seed to
its nest and stashing it in its lair! It gath- ers in the hot season for
the cold, in the time of abundance for the time of dearth, its
sustenance is guaranteed, and its provisions are made to suit. The Great
Benefactor does not ignore it and the Great Rewarder does not deprive
it, even when it lives on dry rock and barren stone. And if you were to
con- template the tracts through which its food passes inside its parts,
high and low, the membranes of its stomach within its abdomen, and all
that its head con- tains, eyes, ears, and everything else, you would
marvel at its creation and be hard pressed to describe it. Exalted be
the one who righted it upon its legs and set it on its limbs! No partner
assisted him to make it, no power helped him in its creation! And if you
were to follow the path of your thought to its log- ical end, you would
infer that the maker of the ant is also the maker of the honeybee.1
Every creature has subtle particulars, and every living being has
imperceptible variances, but with regard to their being created, the
large, the slight, the heavy, the light, the strong, the weak, all are
the same---all are God's creatures. 1.183.3 The case of sky, air, wind,
and water is similar. Observe the sun, moon, plants, trees, water, and
rocks. Observe the alternation of night and day, the roiling of the
seas, the majesty of the mountains, the loftiness of the mas- sifs, the
diversity of languages, and the variety of tongues. Woe to those who
deny the Great Ordainer, who reject the Great Planner! They claim they
are like plants without a cultivator, that there is no artisan who
crafted their dif- ferent forms, but they have no proof for their claim
and no justification for their belief. Can there ever be a building
without a builder, an act without an actor?2 1 Ar. naḥlah; Or, per mss M
"the date-palm (nakhlah)." 2 Lit. "Can there be a crime without a
perpetrator?"; my translation is in the generic sense of action,

423 1.183.4 If you wish, I can also speak of the locust. God gave it two
red eyes and within them he suspended two pupils, two moon-like orbs. He
fashioned for it
minuteearsandanopeningforamouth,gaveitkeensenses,twofang-liketeeth with
which to cut, and two scythe-like forelegs with which to grip. Farmers
dread their ravages---even if they join forces, they can't drive the
locusts away until they've inflicted their violence on the crops and
satisfied their hunger, yet all the while each one measures no more than
a tiny finger! Blessed is he before whom «all who are in the skies and
the earth, obedient or unwilling,»1 fall pros- trate!They press their
cheeks and faces to the earth, throw down their weapons in a vulnerable
plea for amnesty, and offer their reins to him in awe and fear! The
birds are also subject to his command. He reckons the number of their
feathers and their breaths, keeps their feet firm on wet land and dry,
ordains their food, and knows their innumerable species. This one is a
crow, that an eagle, this one a pigeon, that an ostrich. He calls each
bird by its name, and he guarantees its sustenance. Quickening heavy
clouds,2 drawing forth pour- ing rain, and enumerating appointed
bounties, he drenches the land after it was parched and prompts it to
germinate after it was barren. 1.184 From an oration by ʿAlī on God's
oneness that brings together principles of knowledge like no other:
1.184.1 Thosewhoassignhimaformhavenotacknowledgedhisoneness,those who
liken him have not hit upon his reality, those who compare him have not
denoted him, those who point to him or imagine him have not directed
them- selves to him. Each entity that is known in its essence is
constructed, and each entity that stands with another's support is a
result. God acts without imple- ments, he ordains without thought, he is
wealthy without acquisition. Time does not accompany him, and appendages
do not attend him. His being pre- cedes time, his existence precedes
non-existence, and his eternity precedes the beginning. By his forming
of the senses, we know that he has no senses, by his creation of
opposites, we know that he has no rival, by his design of similarities,
we know that he has no peer. He made light the opposite of darkness,
clarity the opposite of gloom, dry the opposite of wet, and heat the
opposite of cold. He joined what was disparate, gathered what was
distinct, brought close the things that were far, and separated those
that were near. He cannot be confined 1 Qurʾan, Raʿd 13:15. 2 Modified
