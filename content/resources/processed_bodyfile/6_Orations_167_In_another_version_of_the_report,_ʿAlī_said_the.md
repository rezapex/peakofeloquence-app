# Chapter 6: Orations 167 In another version of the report, ʿAlī said the
following when he heard their declaration about authority: It's the
manifestation of God's authority in you that I'm waiting for! In a third
version, he said: Under the rule of the pious, the virtuous perform good
deeds. Under the rule of the wicked, the wretched make merry till their
time runs out and death over- takes them. 1.41 From an oration by ʿAlī:1
Loyalty is honesty's twin. I know of no better shield from hellfire, and
those who believe they will return to God never betray.We have entered
an age when the public equates betrayal with intelligence and the
ignorant view duplicitous liars as clever strategists.What is wrong with
them? May God punish them!The man of discernment also knows how to
practice cunning, but he is checked by God's commands and prohibitions.
Although he sees the option and has the capability, he chooses to
refrain. It is the man who has no religion or scruple who exploits the
opportunity to deceive. 1.42 From an oration by ʿAlī:2 People! I fear
most for you two things: pursuit of desire and lengthy yearnings.
Pursuit of desire stops you from seeing the truth, while lengthy
yearnings make
youforgetthehereafter.Takeheed!Theworldisretreatinginhaste!Onlyasmall
residue remains, like dregs in an emptied vessel. Take heed! The
hereafter is at hand! And each of the two has children. Be children of
the hereafter, be not children of the world, for children will be
returned to their mothers on the day of resurrection. Today is the day
for deeds, not reckoning. Tomorrow is the day of reckoning, not deeds. 1
The commentators do not provide context, but Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd narrates
examples of ʿAlī's honorable actions in war, including his allowing
Muʿāwiyah's army to access the river, even after they had earlier denied
it to him. Ḥ2:313--314. The "man of discernment" is ʿAlī himself. 2 ʿAlī
delivered this oration in the Grand Mosque in Kufa immediately following
his arrival after the Battle of the Camel in Rajab 36/656. Minqarī,
Waqʿat Ṣiffīn, 3--4 (with this text, and fur- ther sections of the
oration containing political themes). Some lines are similar in §1.28
and §1.45. Kulaynī (Kāfī, 8:58) transcribes it as the earlier part of
§1.50, which is placed by Yaʿqūbī (Tārīkh, 2:191) after the arbitration
in 37/658. Māmaṭīrī (Nuzhah, 211) attributes the oration to the Prophet,
