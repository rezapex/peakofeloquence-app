# Chapter 1: Orations 111 1.1.4 From the same oration, describing the
creation of Adam: God gathered soil by sifting coarse earth and fine,
sweet earth and salty. He rinsed it with water until it became pure and
clean, and moistened and kneaded it until it was smooth and malleable.
With this mixture, he molded a
formwithcurves,joints,limbs,andnodes.Heletitdryuntilithardened,setting
it aside for a fixed period of time, until it became firm. Then he
breathed into it of his spirit, and it stood before him as a human
being. This being had faculties it could harness, a mind it could
engage, limbs it could yoke to its service, parts it could use as
instruments, and perception with which it could differentiate between
right and wrong, tastes and smells, colors, and species. Its clay was a
blend of disparate entities, assembled forms, warring opposites, and
dissimilar mixtures: hot and cold, wet and dry, painful and joyous.
1.1.5 Then God commanded his angels to fulfill the trust with which he
had charged them and discharge the covenant he had enjoined---to
prostrate hum- bly, deferentially, before Adam, in recognition of the
honor he had received from God. God said, «Prostrate before Adam, and
they all prostrated except Iblīs»1 and Iblīs's tribe. Pride held them
back and wretchedness took over when they boasted of their creation from
fire and scorned the creation of clay. God gave Iblīs a respite so that
he could earn yet more of God's wrath, to complete
thetrialandfulfillthepledge.Hesaid,«Youhavebeenplacedamongthosewho have
been grantedrespiteuntil the dayof destiny.»2 Asfor Adam,God gavehim a
home, with a good life therein and a safe dwelling. He warned him of
Iblīs and of Iblīs's enmity. Iblīs misled Adam, for he was jealous of
Adam's heavenly abode and pious companions. Adam was deceived---he
exchanged certainty for doubt and resolve for weakness, his bliss was
replaced by fear, his decep- tion was followed by regret. Afterward, God
accepted his plea for forgiveness, spoke words of mercy, and promised
him a return to paradise, but he never- theless cast Adam into the abode
of tribulation, where his descendants would multiply for generations.
1.1.6 FromAdam'sdescendants,Godselectedprophets,exactingapledgefrom
themtoconveyhisrevelation,andentrustingthemwithdeliveringhismessage. As
time passed, most people altered God's covenant, denied what they owed
him, and ascribed partners to him. The devils had driven them away from
their earlier recognition of him, stopping them from his worship
altogether. God dis- patched messengers and a succession of prophets to
restore people to their 1 Qurʾan, Baqarah 2:34, Ṭāhā 20:116, Isrāʾ

113 original pledge. He directed his prophets to remind people of the
divine favors they had forgotten, establish the truth by conveying his
message, and revive their numbed intellects. He instructed his prophets
to show people the signs of his power: the sky raised above, and the
earth spread below, livelihoods that sustained life, and lifespans that
ended in death, suffering that made people age, and relentless
calamities. Never in all this time did God allow his creation to be left
without a prophet, a revealed scripture, a sure proof, or a clear path.
The scanty number who answered did not stop God's messengers, nor the
mul- titudes of their repudiators. Each messenger had his successor
named for him, each successor was identified by his predecessor. In this
manner, generations went by, and ages passed. Fathers died, and sons
took their place. 1.1.7 So it was, until God sent Muḥammad to fulfill
his promise and complete the line of prophecy. All earlier prophets had
been made to affirm Muḥammad, whose qualities had been made known to
them, with a binding oath. His birth, when it came, brought auspicious
blessings. At that time, the earth's inhabi- tants were divided into
numerous faiths with different notions and divergent views. One group
likened God to his creatures, another rejected his name, and a third
looked to a separate deity. Through Muḥammad, God saved the peo- ple
from their errant ways. Because of his eminence, he delivered them from
ignorance. Then God summoned Muḥammad to meet with him and desired for
him the blessings to be enjoyed at his side. Raising him from the
vileness of this worldly abode and lifting him from this place of
tribulation, God brought him into his presence, honored and esteemed.
For you, he left you what earlier prophets left their communities, they
did not abandon their followers without guidance, without a clear path
or a signpost. Muḥammad, too, left you your Lord's Book, and he fully
elucidated its contents: the licit versus the illicit, rec- ommended
virtues versus required mandates, abrogating verses versus abro- gated
ones, licenses versus decrees, specifics versus generalities, lessons
versus parables, free verses versus restricted ones, and clear verses
versus ambiguous
ones.HeexplainedtheBook'ssubtletiesandclarifiedwhatwasobscure,includ-

and things that were compulsory in their time, versus others whose

prohibitions of grave sins which incur the punishment of the Fire,
versus smaller transgressions which hold the prospect of God's
forgiveness; of acts acceptable in minimal form, ver- sus those that
earn maximum reward. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera

115 1.1.8 From the same oration: God mandated the rite of pilgrimage to
his House, which he commanded you to face in prayer. He directed you to
race to the House like cattle to water, like doves to seed,
demonstrating your prostration before his greatness and your submission
to his power. He selected true listeners to answer his call, believe in
his word, stand in the stations of the prophets, and follow the example
of angels who circumambulate his throne. These pilgrims obtain abundant
profit through their worship of him, and they speedily secure his
forgiveness. God characterized his House as Islam's lofty banner and
made it a sanctuary for all who seek shelter. Mandating pilgrimage to
it, he com- manded you to submit its due and come to it, and he decreed,
«Pilgrimage to the House is compulsory for all who are able to find a
path. As for those who disbelieve, they should know that God has need of
no one from all the worlds.»1 1.2 From an oration given by ʿAlī during
his return from Ṣiffīn:2 1.2.1 I praise God, seeking the completion of
his favor, submitting to his might, and entreating his protection
against sin. I beseech him, needing only his all-sufficing aid.
Whomsoever God guides never goes astray, whomsoever he abhors never
endures, and whomsoever he suffices never wants. His praise is the
weightiest commodity placed on the celestial scales, and the best
treasure one can hoard. I testify that there is no god but God---I
render this testimony with firm sincerity and true belief. We, all of
us, shall cling to it for as long as God gives us life, relying on it to
dispel the terrors we must face, for it is the requirement of our faith
and the key to God's gifts, it pleases the Merciful and banishes Satan.
I testify that Muḥammad is God's servant and messenger and acknowledge
that God sent Muḥammad with a celebrated religion, a legacy of
knowledge,3 a transcribed scripture, brilliant light, gleaming radiance,
and clear command. All this, in order to remove doubts, establish
proofs, caution with portentous signs, and warn against God's
punishments. When Muḥam- 1 Qurʾan, Āl ʿImrān 3:97. God's House (Bayt

1: Orations 117 mad arrived,1 people were embroiled in seditions.
Religion's rope was severed, conviction's foundations were shaken,
principles were scattered, the commu- nity was shattered, the egress had
narrowed, and a way out could not be seen. Right guidance was not
recognized, and the blindness was total. The Merciful Lord was
disobeyed, Satan was abetted, and faith had no support. Its pillars had
come crashing down, its features were distorted, its paths had fallen
into disre- pair, and its trails had worn away. In obedience to Satan,
people had followed his ways and alighted at his watering hole.With
their support, his banners were raised high, and his pennants were
unfurled. This was a time when sedition was ascendant, when people were
crushed by its steeds and trampled under its hooves. Enmeshed in its
throes, they were in a state of convulsion, lost, confused, and
ignorant. They lived in the best of abodes but with the worst of
neighbors. They lived in a land where the learned were demeaned and the
ignorant esteemed.Here,slumber had turned intoinsomniaand kohlhadbeen
replaced by tears. 1.2.2 From the same oration, referring to the
Prophet's family: They are the embodiments of God's mystery, the
foundations of his creed, the vessels of his knowledge, the harbors for
his wisdom, the havens for his scrip- tures,andthepeaksof
hisreligion.Throughthem,hestraightensreligion'sback when it becomes
crooked, and calms its limbs when it trembles. From the same oration,
referring to the hypocrites: They sowed immorality, watered it with
arrogance, and reaped perdition. No one from this community may be
compared to Muḥammad's family, and no one blessed by God's favors may be
equated with them in this regard. They are the pillar of religion and
the column of certainty. The exaggerator must return to their position,
and the laggard must join up with it. Theirs is the right of allegiance,
theirs the Prophet's testament and inheritance. Now, in this moment,
truth has been restored to its owners and returned to its home. 1 After
Ḥ1:137. These lines, from "fī fitanin," to the end of the section, have
alternatively been read as a reference to the seditions in ʿAlī's time.

119 1.3 FromanorationbyʿAlīknownasShiqshiqiyyah---"TheRoarof
theCamelStallion":1 1.3.1 By God, that man donned its cloak knowing that
I am the pivot to its grinding stone---its stream flows from my summit
and no soaring bird can reach my heights. I draped a curtain across it
and turned my face away. I weighed two options: strike with an amputated
hand or endure a blind dark- ness that renders adults infirm and
children old, in which believers continue to brave toil and turmoil
until they meet their Lord. I saw that forbearance was the judicious
choice. So I endured---but my eyes filled with dust and my throat choked
as I saw my inheritance looted. 1.3.2 Thus it was, until the first went
on his way, tossing it to another after him. Then ʿAlī recited a
testimonial verse:2 O how different my days today, always in the saddle,
and the days spent in the company of Jābir's brother, Ḥayyān! How
strange that he should wish to give it up during his lifetime yet secure
it for another after his death! The two divided the milk from its udders
between them! This next one corralled it to a stony field, where any who
ventured sus- tained deep wounds and experienced rough passage. How
often did people stumble in this terrain, and how often did they make
excuses for stumbling! 1 Delivered in Raḥbah, south of Kufa, toward the
end of ʿAlī's caliphate, in response to Ibn ʿAbbās's query about the
Prophet's succession, according to Mufīd (Irshād, 287). Sibṭ(Tadhki-
rah, 124) states it was delivered on the pulpit of the Prophet's Mosque
in Medina in 35/656, soon after ʿAlī was pledged allegiance as caliph,
in response to a person calling out to him, "What kept you back until
now?", but this earlier dating is unlikely given the reference in the
final section (§1.3.4) to the three groups who rebelled against him.
"It" in the first line is the caliphate, and "that man" (lit. Ibn Abī
fulān, "son of so-and-so") is Abū Bakr, the first historical caliph. The
second individual (§1.3.2) is Umar, and "the third" (§1.3.3) is ʿUthmān;
"his clan" refers to the Umayyads. This oration is controversial because
of its political con- tent, but it is not so different from materials
recorded by the earliest historians: Ibn Hishām (Sīrah, 2:489--490),
Ṭabarī (Tārīkh, 4:231--233, 5:7--8), Yaʿqūbī (Tārīkh, 2:126), and Ibn
Qutay- bah (Imāmah, 1:28--33), all note ʿAlī's refusal to accept Abū
Bakr as caliph until forced to do so. They also record ʿAlī's
declarations about his right to the caliphate immediately after Muḥam-
mad's death, and during the deliberations of ʿUmar's Shūrā council. For
details of this issue and further primary sources, see Madelung, The
Succession to Muḥammad, 28--33, 141, and passim; and Madelung,
"S̲h̲īʿa,"ei2. The Shiʿi commentators read the oration as proof of ʿAlī's
imamate, while the Sunni commentators read it as an articulation of
ʿAlī's superiority over all other Companions of the Prophet. B 153--155;
R 1:122; Ḥ1:156--159; ʿA 565. 2 By the pre-Islamic poet Aʿshā Maymūn
(d. ca. 7/629), Dīwān al-Aʿshā, 147, §18, verse 57. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

121 Any who traversed it rode a bucking camel---tighten its rein and
slit its nose or loosen the ropes and be thrown. By God, the community
was struck by kick- ing feet and rearing hooves and tormented with
caprice and obstruction. I endured---but it was a long time and a harsh
affliction. 1.3.3 Thus it was, until, when he went on his way, he handed
it over to a group of people he supposed I belonged with. Dear God, what
a Council! Was there doubt regarding my stature, even in comparison with
the first of them, that I was now being equated with these laggards! But
I moved with them, falling when they fell and flying when they flew.
Even so, one of them turned away from me because of an old grudge,1
another inclined toward someone else because he was related to him by
marriage,2 along with this one and that one, until the third stood up,
bosom swelling with pride, amid his dung and fodder. His clan stood up
with him, munching on God's property like a herd of camels munching on
spring grass. 1.3.4 Thus it was, until its strands came apart in his
hands and his own actions delivered the death blow. It was greed that
brought him to the ground. Then
suddenly,peoplewereflockingtome,thickasahyena'smane,tramplingḤasan and
Ḥusayn and rending my own shirt, pressing in on me from every side like
a surging herd of camels.3 But when I rose to undertake its charge, one
group of rebels broke their pledge, another deserted the faith, and a
third went astray. Had they never heard God's words, «We shall reserve
the hereafter for those who do not seek to exalt themselves on the earth
or spread corruption. The good end is for the godfearing»?4Yes, byGod,
they heard and understood it, but the world appeared bejeweled to their
eyes and her ornaments dazzled them. I
swearbyhimwhosplitopentheseed,theonewhocreatedlivingbeings---were it not
for those who appealed to me in that time, if the presence of support-
ers had not made it my binding duty, if God had not taken a pledge from
the learnedthattheywouldnotpermittyrantstoravageorthesubjugatedtostarve,
I would have flung the caliphate's reins onto its shoulders and offered
the same cup to its latest emissary that I had offered to its earliest
one. If not for this, you would have seen that your world means less to
me than the sneeze of a goat. 1 Saʿd ibn Abī Waqqāṣ. R 1:122; Ḥ1:184,

123 1.3.5
WhenʿAlīreachedthispointinhisoration,avisitorfromthecountrysidehanded
him a petition, and he paused to look at it. When he had finished
reading, Ibn ʿAbbās asked, "Commander of the Faithful, will you not
continue your speech where you left off?" "No, Ibn ʿAbbās," ʿAlī
replied, "that was the roar of a camel stallion that burst out then
subsided." Ibn ʿAbbās remarked, "By God, I have never regretted the loss
of any words as much as I regret the loss of these---if only the
Commander of the Faithful had completed what he began!" 1.3.6 Raḍī:
ʿAlī's words in this oration: "Any who traversed it rode a bucking
camel--- tighten its rein and slit its nose, or loosen it and be
thrown," mean that if the rider were to pull strongly on the reins of a
bucking came while it pulled the other way, he would slit its nose, but
if he were to slacken them a little, then that, coupled with the camel's
recalcitrance, would mean that the camel would throw him off, for he
would be unable to control it. It is said, "He tightened the reins of
the camel mare" (ashnaqa l-
nāqata),whensomeonepullsbackthecamel'smuzzlewiththenose-reinandliftsitup;
the basic form of the verb (shanaqa) is also used---Ibn al-Sikkīt
mentions this in Iṣlāḥ al-manṭiq (Correcting Speech). ʿAlī said, "He
tightened for it its reins (ashnaqa lahā)" (using the preposition li-),1
rather than "He tightened its reins (ashnaqahā)" (with the camel as
direct object), because he wanted to preserve the parallelism with "if
he loos- ened them (aslasa lahā)," where he also used the preposition
li-. It is as though ʿAlī said, "if he raised the camel's head upward
with the nose-rein," meaning that he held the camel tightly by means of
it. 1.4 From an oration by ʿAlī:2 Through us you received guidance in
the dark night, mounted the camel's lofty hump, and emergedfroma
moonlessnight intothelight of dawn.Howdeaf are the ears that don't hear
the mourners' wails! Can people whom a clap of thun- der fails to awaken
be expected to heed a gentle voice? How calm is the heart that shudders
in fear of God! I knew you would be treacherous, for I saw you donning
seduction's garb. But I wear the robe of religion, and it has prevented
me from harming you, though my righteous spirit showed me clearly what
you were. I stood up to guide you back to the trodden path of truth,
from all those trails where you had wandered without a guide, where you
had dug for water but found none. Today I have made mute signs, eloquent
ones, speak to you. Those who held back from me have strayed. I never
doubted the truth since it 1 Li- is the usual form of this preposition,
but it changes to la- before pronominals, as it has here and a few lines
below. 2 After the Battle of the Camel in 36/656, posthumously

125 was shown to me. Moses was not fearful for his life---what he feared
was the dominance of the ignorant and the control of the errant.1 Today,
we faced off on the battlefield, one on the side of right, the other on
the side of wrong. A man who knows he will find water does not feel
thirst. 1.5 An address ʿAlī delivered when God's Messenger passed away,
and ʿAbbās and Abū Sufyān came to him offering the pledge of caliphal
allegiance:2 People! Cut through the waves of rebellion by boarding the
ark of salvation. Leave the path of dissension and cast off the crown of
pride. Success comes to those who rise when they have support, or yield
and let people be. This affair resembles murky water, or a morsel that
chokes those who swallow it. One who plucks before his time gains as
little as one who plants in another's field. If I say something now,
they will respond, "He covets power." If I remain silent, they will cry,
"He is afraid of being killed!" No, indeed, ⟨not after the small
calamity and the large one⟩!3 By God, Abū Ṭālib's son is more
comfortable with death than an infant at his mother's breast! But I hold
knowledge of mysteries.Were I to reveal them to you, you would tremble
like ropes hanging down deep wells. 1.6 From an address ʿAlī delivered
when advised not to pursue Ṭalḥah and Zubayr or make preparations to
fight them:4 By God, I shall not behave like the hyena that, sleeping
through a prolonged barrage of pebbles, is captured by the stealthy
hunter.5 I call on men who have 1 Refers to the Qurʾanic story of Moses
(Qurʾan, Hūd 11:70,Ṭāhā 20:67), and compares ʿAlī's story to it. 2 In
11/632, in Medina. Ṭabrisī (Iḥtijāj, 1:127) cites the first three lines
as part of a note ʿAlī wrote to Abū Bakr, after he had denied Fāṭimah
her right to inherit the orchards of Fadak. ʿAbbās ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib
was ʿAlī and Muḥammad's uncle. Abū Sufyān was Muʿāwiyah's father and
Muḥammad's arch foe, before he converted to Islam following the
Prophet's conquest of Mecca. The two---ʿAbbās and Abū Sufyān---were
close associates. 3 Proverb signifying all sorts of calamities (etiology
in Maydānī, Majmaʿ, 1:92), signifying that ʿAlī has faced death on the
battlefield throughout his life. 4 In Rabadhah, near Medina, in 36/656,
enrouteto Iraq in the lead-up to the Battle of the Camel (Ṭabarī,
Tārīkh, 4:455--456), or in Dhū Qār, soon after arriving in Iraq (ibid.,
4:457--458); ʿAlī's son Ḥasan is named as his interlocutor. 5 See
similar phraseology in §1.146. The signification of the simile is being
naively unaware of danger despite ample warning. In medieval Arab lore,
the hyena (ḍabuʿ) is reputed to be a stupid animal. Easily tricked by
the hunter who throws pebbles to draw it out, it emerges from its den,
thinking to find prey, and is killed. Hyenas were apparently hunted as
food; their meat is considered licit in the Shāfiʿī and Ḥanbalī schools
of law, and a delicacy in present-day Saudi Arabia (Osborne, "Hyena
Burger?"). B 170; R 149; Ḥ224; Ibn Manẓūr, Lisān, s.v. "L-D-Gh"; Jāḥiẓ,
Ḥayawān, 6:38, 7:48; Damīrī, Ḥayāt al-ḥayawān, 2:206. For further
details and sources, see Viré, "Ḍabuʿ,"ei2. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī
