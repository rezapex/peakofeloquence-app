# Chapter 36: Orations 389 1.170 From an oration by ʿAlī:1 1.170.1 Praise
God, from whose vision one sky does not conceal another, one earth does
not conceal another. 1.170.2 From the same oration:
Someonesaidtome,"Howyoucovetthecaliphate,sonof AbūṬālib!"Iretorted, "No,
by God, you are more covetous and farther away from it, while I am
closer and more worthy! What I seek is my right, and you are blocking me
from it, you are hitting me in the face and pushing me away!" When I
struck him with this clear argument in front of the whole group, he was
dumbstruck and could find no answer. 1.170.3 God, I ask your help
against Quraysh and their supporters. They have severed the bonds of my
kinship, demeaned my lofty station, and banded together to wrest my
right from me. Then they say, "A right may be taken, a right may also be
abandoned."2 1.170.4 From the same oration describing ʿAlī's opponents
at the Battle of the Camel:3 They marched toward Basra dragging the
Messenger's wife with them like a
slave-girldraggedforsale,havingveiledtheirownwomentotheirhomes,while
exposing the Messenger's wife to their eyes and the eyes of others in
their army. There was not a single individual in that army, moreover,
who had not sworn obedience to me, who had willingly, without coercion,
pledged allegiance to me. They advanced against my governor in Basra, as
well as the custodians of the public treasury and other townspeople, and
they killed a number after cap- turing them, and several more whom they
tricked with their treachery. By God, if they had purposefully killed
even a single Muslim without a crime to justify 1 In Basra, in 36/656,
soon after the Battle of the Camel (reference to the battle in
§1.170.4). §1.170.4 is cited as an answer given during an oration in the
mosque in Basra, a few days after the battle (Māmaṭīrī, Nuzhah, 228);
other parts of the oration as cited in ibid., 221--233, are listed in
the note to §1.23. The reference in §1.170.2--3 is to the Shūrā Council
that elected ʿUthmān in 23/644. Ḥ9:305. 2 Similar lines in §1.215.1. 3
"They" are Ṭalḥah and Zubayr, "the Messenger's wife" is ʿĀʾishah. For
context of the Battle of the Camel and ʿĀʾishah's role, see Ḥ9:310--327;
B 561--564; F 288--289. ʿAlī's governor in Basra was ʿUthmān ibn Ḥunayf,
a Companion of the Prophet. Similar lines in §1.215.2. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

1: Orations 391 his killing, it would be lawful for me to execute their
whole army, for they all stood by without protest. They failed to defend
any of the innocent victims with their hands or even with their tongues!
But, in fact, they have not just killed one---they have killed a great
many Muslims, as many as the numbers with which they themselves entered
the city. 1.171 From an oration by ʿAlī:1 1.171.1
Muḥammadwasthetrusteeof God'srevelation,thesealof hisprophets, the
herald of his mercy, and the warner ahead of his punishment. 1.171.2
People!The individual most worthy to assume the mantle of leadership is
the one who is most capable of carrying its trust, most knowledgeable
about God's command. After the pledge, if a rebel revolts, he is to be
persuaded to return to the fold, and if he refuses, he is to be fought.
By my life, if you are saying that the imamate can be pledged only with
the whole populace in atten- dance, there is no way to do this! Instead,
the leaders decide on behalf of the absent,2 and afterward, those who
were present have no right to rescind their pledge, while the absent
have no right to choose another. Hark! I shall fight two kinds of men,
the man who claims what does not belong to him, and another who refuses
to render his due. I counsel you to be conscious of God---this is the
best counsel his servants can give one another, and the way that obtains
the best outcome before God. Hear me! War has commenced between you and
people of the Qiblah,3 and our banner can be carried only by people of
percep- tion and fortitude, those who know where truth resides. Enact
what you are commanded, then, and desist from what you are forbidden. Do
not hasten to an action until you have clarity, for anything you
discover to be wrong I will change.4 1 Likely delivered just before or
soon after the Battle of the Camel in 36/656: §1.171.3 is included by
Ḥarrānī (Tuḥaf, 183--184) in an oration that he says ʿAlī delivered
"when some people expressed unhappiness at his levelling of stipends
among the people," which fits with what the sources say of Ṭalḥah's and
Zubayr's source of dissatisfaction with ʿAlī's rule. §1.171.2 (and
§1.83.3) are recorded by Minqarī (Waqʿat Ṣiffīn, 10) and Abū Ḥanīfah
al-Dīnawarī (Akhbār 152--153) as part of ʿAlī's first Friday sermon in
Kufa. 2 Ar. ahlahā, lit. "its people"; my translation, "their leaders,"
is based on B 566; Ḥ9:329, which interpret the phrase as "the people of
loosening and binding" (ahl al-ḥall wa-l-ʿaqd) and "scholars" (ʿulamāʾ).
3 I.e., fellow Muslims. The Qiblah is the direction of the Kaʿbah in
Mecca that all Muslims face in ritual prayer. 4 The context for this
last statement is ʿUthmān's unwillingness to make changes in his admin-
istration, even when its wrongs were brought to his notice. B 566.

1: Orations 393 1.171.3 Hark my words! This world that you covet and
desire, that causes you anger and pleasure, is not your home, it is not
the residence for which you have been created or to which you have been
called. Listen to me! It will not remain for you, nor will you remain in
it. While it tempts you with its allures, it also warns you of its evil,
so heed its warnings and threats, and shun its temptations and
enticements. Turn your heart away and race to the home to which you are
called. Let no one among you sniffle like a young slave- girl over
anything he has lost of this world! Instead, seek the completion of
God's blessings by being patient in the path of his obedience and
holding fast to God's Book. Hark and listen! Nothing you surrender of
this world will harm you if you secure the principles of your faith!
Hark again! Nothing you secure of your worldly affairs will benefit you
if you surrender your faith! May God guide our hearts toward the truth.
May he grant us patience in adver- sity. 1.172 From an address by ʿAlī
about Ṭalḥah ibn ʿUbaydallāh:1 Ihaveneverbeenonetobeshakenbythreatsof
battleorpanickedbynoticesof attack. I await the victory my Lord has
promised me. By God, Ṭalḥah only has- tened to draw his sword and demand
vengeance for ʿUthmān's blood because he feared that the same call was
going to be made against him! He is impli- cated in this matter, for
none among the people was more avid for it than he---he wishes to create
confusion and has raised a tumult about it only in order to muddy the
issue and raise doubt. By God, he took none of the three proper courses
in the crisis around ʿUthmān: If Ibn ʿAffān was an oppressor, as Ṭalḥah
believed, he should have backed those who killed him or at least
rebuffed his supporters. If ʿUthmān was a victim, Ṭalḥah should have
been among those who defended him and pleaded his cause. And if he was
in doubt about both choices, he should have dissociated from ʿUthmān and
remained on the sidelines, leaving the people to do their will. But he
did none of this--- he followed a path whose entryway was unsanctioned
and whose justifications were unsound. 1 In Medina in 36/656, soon after
ʿAlī's accession to the caliphate, when news arrived that Ṭal- ḥah and
Zubayr were on their way to Basra to recruit an army to fight him (B
567; on Ṭalḥah's misconduct with ʿUthmān, see Ḥ10:5--9; B 568). Kulaynī
(Kāfī, 5:53) quotes the first few lines in an oration at the Battle of
the Camel outside Basra in 36/656. The first line is similar to the
penultimate line of §1.22. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera
