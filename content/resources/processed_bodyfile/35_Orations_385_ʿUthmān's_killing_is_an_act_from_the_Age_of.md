# Chapter 35: Orations 385 ʿUthmān's killing is an act from the Age of
Ignorance and its perpetrators have strong support. If an order were
given now, you would see the people divide into three groups: one would
agree with you, another would think the opposite, and a third would see
neither the one nor the other. Be patient, let the people calm down and
hearts settle, then justice can be exacted more easily. Step back and
see what my rule brings---don't be impulsive in doing something that
will wreck your power, ruin your force, and bequeath weakness and
humiliation. I will hold things together as long as they will stay
together. If I am left with no alternative, then, when afflictedby an
incurable disease, ⟨cauterizing is the last resort⟩.1 1.167 From an
oration by ʿAlī in the lead-up to the Battle of the Camel, when his
oppo- nents marched on Basra:2 God sent a Messenger, a guide, with a
book that speaks and an established religion.3 Whoever dies having
strayed from them will perish, for dubious and heretical innovations
bring perdition, except when God protects from their harm. Submitting to
God's authority safeguards your religion. Render him obe- dience, then,
without blame or force. By God, you must do this, else he will remove
Islam's authority from your control and never give it back, and rule
will pass to another group! These individuals have banded to condemn my
com- mand, and I will be patient for as long as I don't fear for your
concord---if they continue to pursue this errant course, the Muslims'
stability will crumble.They seek this world and envy those to whom God
has awarded it, they wish to turn these affairs back on their heels. My
promise to you is this: I shall act on the Book of God and the practice
of his Messenger. I shall uphold his right and revive his Sunnah. 1.168
From ʿAlī's address to an Arab sent by a group of Basrans when he
approached their city, in the lead-up to the Battle of the Camel, to
find out the truth of ʿAlī's deal- ings with his opponents, because they
were unsure of who was in the right. When ʿAlī explained what had
transpired, the man accepted that he, ʿAlī, was in the right. ʿAlī 1 Ar.

also rendered: ākhir
al-dawāʾal-kayy,⟨thefinalmedicineiscauterization⟩,orākhiral-ṭibbal-kayy,⟨thefinaltreat-
ment is cauterization⟩. Etiology in F 283--284; Ibn Manẓūr, Lisān,
s.v. "K-W-Y." 2 Delivered in Medina in 36/656, while preparing to march
to Iraq, urging the Medinans to mobilize. Ṭabarī, Tārīkh, 4:445--446. 3
Ar. amr, translated here as "religion," lit. "affair," used twice more
in this passage, once in the plural umūr. In addition to the faith of
Islam, the word also simultaneously denotes its political entity; I have
used "caliphate" to translate the second instance, and "affairs" to
bring together both meanings in the third instance. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

387 then said to him, "Pledge the oath of allegiance!" to which he
replied, "I am my people's emissary, and can do nothing on my own; I
have to first return to them." ʿAlī then said:1 If the people you
represent had sent you as a scout to find out where the rains are
falling, and, if, when you told them where to find grass and water, they
went againstyourrecommendationandheadedforparched,drought-hitlands,what
would you do then? The man replied, "I would leave them and proceed to
where there was grass and water." ʿAlī declared, "In that case, extend
your hand!" The man said later, "By God, I was not able to refuse when
the case was so clearly proven, and I pledged him allegiance." The man's
name was Kulayb al-Jarmī. 1.169 From ʿAlī's prayer when he had resolved
to fight the enemy at Ṣiffīn:2 God! O Lord of the lofty sky and layers
of air, you made the sky and air the marshland into which night and day
are absorbed, the course where the sun and moon orbit, and thespace
throughwhichthemovingplanetssail.Youpop- ulated it with tribes of your
angels, who never tire of your worship. O Lord of this earth, you made
the earth a home for humans, a place for insects to crawl
andcattletoroam,andahabitatforcountlessothercreatures,seenandunseen.
OLordof themightymountains,youmadethemountainsanchorsfortheearth and a
refuge for your creatures. Hear our prayer: If you grant us victory over
our enemy, then hold us back from treachery and direct us to follow the
truth. If you grant them victory over us, then honor us with martyrdom
and save us from sedition. People, where are your doughty fighters who
would defend honor and guard families with zeal when the blows of war
descend? Behind you lies shame! Before you is paradise! 1 This event
took place a little before the Battle of the Camel, after Ṭalḥah and
Zubayr had entered Basra, and ʿAlī, on his way to confront them in
Basra, was encamped nearby in Dhū Qār. Mufīd, Jamal, 156, after Wāqidī;
