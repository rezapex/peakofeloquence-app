# Chapter 46: Orations 445 into the dark night of his ignorance and the
abyss of his error, docile under his direction and submissive under his
reins. In Satan's grip, hearts resembled one another as generation
followed generation. Pride ruled as breasts became straitened by its
grip. Hark and beware! Beware of obeying these chieftains and elders,1
who have magnified themselves above their stature and aggrandized
themselves beyond their lineage, who have attributed vile deeds to their
Lord and challenged his actions, scorning his decree and impugning his
favors.They are pillars of factionalism, columns of sedition, and swords
of ancestor boasts from the Age of Ignorance. Be conscious of God. Do
not repulse his favors by acting in a contrary manner or repel his
generosity by your envy. Don't obey false claimants whose muddy slime
you have drunk instead of your pure water, whose diseases have infected
your sound health, and whose wrong you have mixed in with your right.
They are the foundations of vice, the constant com- panions of
rebellion. Iblīs owns them---steeds of error and an army with which he
assaults people.He hasappointedthemhisinterpreters.Speakingwiththeir
tongues, he weakens your minds, lends you his eyes, and whispers in your
ears. In this manner, he targets you with his arrows, tramples you under
his foot, and crushes you in his closed fist. 1.190.4 Learn lessons from
what arrogant nations before you faced: God's crushing blows, his sudden
attacks, his shocking onslaughts, and his exem- plary punishments.Take
counsel from knowing that their cheeks are now stuck inside the earth
and their torsos are struck onto the ground. Seek refuge in God from the
pregnant dangers of pride, just as you seek refuge in him from the
battering calamities of the age. If God had permitted any of his
servants pride, he would have permitted it to his select prophets, but
he disliked them to be proud and preferred them to be humble. They
placed their cheeks on the earth before him and pressed their faces to
the dirt. They lowered their wings for believers and were a group that
was widely scorned as weak.2 He tested them with hunger, afflicted them
with weariness, tried them with dangers, and ground them down with
adversities. People, do not weigh God's pleasure and displeasure in
terms of wealth and offspring, without knowing what tests and trials
inhere in positions of wealth or poverty! God has said, «Do they think
we supply them with wealth and sons in order to increase their comforts?
No indeed,theyhavenoidea!»3Godtestspeoplewhoaremightyintheirownview,
through his chosen ones, who are weak in their eyes. Moses, son of

1: Orations 447 and with him his brother Aaron, were admitted to Pharaoh
wearing shifts of coarse wool and holding wooden staffs, and they
offered him a guarantee--- if he committed to God's will, his kingdom
would last forever, and his might would persist. Pharaoh exclaimed, "Do
you not wonder at these two? They promise me the continuation of my
might and the perpetuation of my king- dom when, as you see, they are
utterly poor and totally contemptible! How is it they are not adorned
with bracelets of gold?" Pharaoh prized gold and the hoarding of it and
mocked coarse wool and the wearing of it. If God, when he sent his
prophets, had wished to open for them treasuries of gold, stores of bul-
lion, and the granaries of the celestial garden, if he had wished to
assemble in their legions the birds of the air and the beasts of the
earth, he would have done so. And had he done so, the trial would have
been nullified, recompense would have become invalid, and true reports
would have dwindled. Those who accepted the prophets' message would not
have deserved the reward of those who had been tested, believers would
not have merited the reward of good deeds, and words would not have
retained their meanings. But God sent his messengers strong in
resolution, weak in terms of what eyes perceived. Their contentment
filled hearts and eyes with riches, while their destitution filled
eyesandearswithpain.If theseprophetshadpossessedstrengththatcouldnot be
challenged, might that could not be diminished, and kingship toward
which men's necks craned and saddles were fastened, these conditions
would have relieved the weight of reflection for the people and broken
their arrogance. People would have become believers either out of
subjugation to fear or the pull of desire. Intentions would have been
split and benefits would accordingly have been divided. But God willed
that all pious acts---devotion to his messen- gers, acceptance of the
truth of his books, self-effacement for his sake, humility before his
command, and submission to him and obedience---all these things should
be pure and for himself alone, untainted by any drop of insincerity. The
greater the test and trial, the grander the reward and recompense.
1.190.5 Do you not see? Starting with Adam, God tested all who came
before, up to the very last people in this world, with stones that
neither harm nor ben- efit nor see nor hear, shaping them into his
sacred house and designating it a place of worship for all humans. He
placed this House in the most rugged, most rocky region of the earth, in
the most barren place in the world, in the narrow- est, steepest cleft
of a valley, between rough mountains, tracts of porous sand, springs
with slow-trickling water, and scattered habitations, where no hoofed
animals---neither camels, nor mules, nor sheep---could feed or
thrive.Then he
commandedAdamandhischildrentoturntheirbodiestowardit,makingitthe place
to which they should return time after time to seek their journeys'
