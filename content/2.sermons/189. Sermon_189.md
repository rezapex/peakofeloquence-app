*Steadfast and transient belief and the obligation of migration
(hijrah)*

> ومن خطبته (عليه السلام)

> في الايمان ووجوب الهجرة

One belief is that which is firm and steadfast in hearts, and one is
that which remains temporarily in the heart and the breast up to a
certain time. If you were to acquit (yourself) before any person, you
should wait till death approaches him, for that is the time limit for
being acquitted.

> فَمِنَ الاْيمَانِ مَا يَكُونُ ثَابِتاً مُسْتَقِرّاً فِي الْقُلُوبِ، وَمِنْهُ مَا يَكُونُ عَوَارِىَ بَيْنَ
> الْقُلُوبِ وَالصُّدورِ، إِلَى أَجَل مَعْلُوم، فَإِذَا كَانَتْ لَكُمْ بَرَاءَةٌ مِنْ أَحَد فَقِفُوهُ حَتّى
> يَحْضُرَهُ الْمَوْتُ، فَعِنْدَ ذَلِكَ يَقَعُ حدُّ الْبَرَاءَةِ.

## The obligation of migration

> وجوب الهجرة

And migration stands as its original position. Allah has no need towards
him who secretly accepts belief or him who openly does so. Migration
will not apply to any one unless he recognises the proof (of Allah) on
the earth. Whoever recognises him and acknowledges him would be a
*muhajir* (migrant). *Istid'af* (i.e.the state of being deemed weak and
therefore free from the obligation of migration) does not apply to him
to whom the proof (of Allah) reaches and who hears it and his heart
preserves it. {#epub.html_fref_d061ca17_1
.see-footnote}

> وَالْهِجْرَةُ قَائِمَةٌ عَلَى حَدِّهَا الاْوَّلِ، مَا كَانَ لله تعالى فِي أَهْلِ الاْرْضِ حَاجَةٌ مِنْ
> مُسْتَسِرِّ الاْمَّةِ وَمُعْلِنِهَا، لاَ يَقَعُ اسْمُ الْهِجْرَةِ عَلَى أَحَد إلاَّ بِمَعْرِفَةِ الْحُجَّةِ في
> الاْرْضِ، فَمَنْ عَرَفَهَا وَأَقَرَّ بِهَا فَهُوَ مُهَاجِرٌ، وَلاَ يَقَعُ اسْمُ الاسْتِضْعَافِ عَلَى مَنْ
> بَلَغَتْهُ الْحُجَّةُ فَسَمِعَتْهَا أُذُنُهُ وَوَعَاهَا قَلْبُهُ.

## Arduousness of belief

> صعوبة الايمان

Certainly, our case is difficult and complicated. No one can bear it
except a believer whose heart Allah has tried with belief. Our
traditions will not be preserved except by trustworthy hearts and (men
of) solid understanding.

> إِنَّ أَمْرَنا صَعْبٌ مُسْتَصْعَبٌ، لاَ يَحْتَمِلُهُ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ مُؤْمِنٌ امْتَحَنَ اللهُ قَلْبَهُ لِلاِيمَانِ،
> وَلاَ يَعِي حَدِيثَنَا إِلاَّ صُدُورٌ أَمِينَةٌ، وَأَحْلاَمٌ رَزِينَةٌ.

## The knowledge of the successor (wasi), his challenge \"Ask me before you miss me\" and prophecy about the Umayyads

> علم الوصي

O people! Ask me before you lose me, because certainly I am acquainted
with the passages of the sky more than the passages of the
earth,{#epub.html_fref_0454223e_2
.see-footnote} and before that mischief springs upon its feet which
would trample even the nosestring and destroy the wits of the people.

> أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، سَلُوني قَبْلَ أَنْ تَفْقِدُوني، فَلاَنَا بِطُرُقِ السَّماءِ أَعْلَمُ مِنِّي بِطُرُقِ
> الاْرْضِ، قَبْلَ أَنْ تَشْغَرَ بِرِجْلِهَا فِتْنَةٌ تَطَأُ فِي خِطَامِهَا وَتَذْهَبُ بِأَحْلاَمِ قَوْمِهَا.

-  This is the
    interpretation of the word \"muhajir\" and \"mustad\`af\" as
    mentioned in the Holy Qur\'an:\
    Verily those whom the angels take away (at death) while they are
    unjust to their (own) selves (in sin), they (the angels) shall ask
    (the sinning souls): \"In what state were ye?\" They shall reply,
    \"Weakened (mustad\`af - and oppressed) were we in the land;\" They
    (angels) will say \"Was not the land of Allah vast (enough) for you
    to immigrate therein?\" So these (are those) whose refuge shall be
    Hell; and what a bad resort it is. Except the (really) weakened ones
    from among the men and the women and the children, who have not in
    their power the means (to escape from the unbelievers) and nor do
    they find the (right) way. So these, may be, Allah will pardon them;
    and Allah is the Clement, the Oft-forgiving. (4:97-99)\
    The meaning of Amir al-mu\'minin here is that hijrah (migration) was
    not only obligatory during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet, but it
    is a permanent obligation. This migration is even now obligatory for
    attaining the proof of Allah and the true religion. Therefore, if
    one has attained the proof of Allah and believed in it, even if he
    is in midst of the unbelievers of his locality, he is not duty bound
    to migrate.\
    The \"mustad\`af\" (weakened) is one who is living among the
    unbelievers and is far from being informed of the proofs of Allah,
    and at the same time he is unable to migrate in order to attain the
    proofs of Allah.]
-  Some people have
    explained this saying of Amir al-mu\'minin to mean that by the
    passages of the earth he means matters of the world and by passages
    of the sky matters of religious law and that Amir al-mu\'minin
    intends to say that he knows the matters of religious law and
    commandments more than the worldly matters. Thus, Ibn Maytham
    al-Bahrani writes (in Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 4, pp. 200-201):\
    It is related from al-\`Allamah al-Wabari, that he said that Amir
    al-mu\'minin\'s intention is to say that the scope of his religious
    knowledge is larger than his knowledge about matters of the world.\
    But taking the context into account, this explanation cannot be held
    to be correct because this sentence (which is the subject of
    explanation) has been used as the cause of the sentence \"Ask me
    before you miss me\", and after it, is the prophesy about revolt. In
    between these two the occurrence of the sentence that \"I know
    religious matters more than worldly matters\", makes the whole
    utterance quite uncounted, because Amir al-mu\'minin\'s challenge to
    ask whatever one likes is not confined to matters of religious law
    only so this sentence could be held as its cause. Then, after that,
    the prophesy of the rising up of the revolt has nothing to do with
    matters of religious law, so that it could be put forth as a proof
    of more knowledge of religious matters. To ignore the clear import
    of the words and to interpret them in a way which does not suit the
    occasion, does not exhibit a correct spirit, when from the context
    also the same meaning accrues which the words openly convey. Thus,
    it is to give a warning about the Umayyad\'s mischief that Amir
    al-mu\'minin uttered the words: \"\'Ask me whatever you like\';
    because I know the paths and courses of divine destiny more than the
    passages of the earth. So, even if you ask me about matters which
    are recorded in the \'preserved tablet\' and concern divine destiny
    I can tell you, and a serious mischief is to rise against me in
    those matters in which you should have doubt, because my eyes are
    more acquainted with those ethereal lines which concern the
    occurrence of events and mischiefs than, with what I know about live
    appearing on the earth. The occurrence of this mischief is as
    certain as an object seen with eyes. You should therefore ask me its
    details and the way to keep safe from it, so that you may be able to
    manage your defence when the times comes.\" This meaning is
    supported by the successive sayings of Amir al-mu\'minin which he
    uttered in connection with the unknown, and to which the future
    testified. Thus, Ibn Abi\'l Hadid comments on this claim of Amir
    al-mu\'minin as follows:\
    Amir al-mu\'minin\'s claim is also supported by his sayings about
    future events which he uttered not once or a hundred times but
    continuously and successively, from which there remains no doubt
    that whatever he spoke was on the basis of knowledge and certainly
    and not in the way of chance. (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 13, p.
    106)\
    In connection with this saying of Amir al-mu\'minin it has already
    been shown and explained (in Sermon 92, Foot-note No. 2) that no one
    else dared advance such a claim, and those who made such a claim had
    to face only disgrace and humility. About the prophecies made by
    Amir al-mu\'minin see Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid, Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol.
    7, pp. 47-51; al-Qadi Nuru\'l-Lah al-Mar\`ashi, Ihqaq al-haqq (New
    ed.), vol. 8, pp. 87-182.]
