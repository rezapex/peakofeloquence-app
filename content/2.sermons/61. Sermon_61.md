*Amir al-mu\'minin also said concerning the Kharijites:*

> وقال (عليه السلام) فيهم

Do not fight{#epub.html_fref_cf945d31_1
.see-footnote} the Kharijites after me, because one who seeks right but
does not find it, is not like one who seeks wrong and finds it.

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** (By "one who seeks wrong and finds it") Amir
al-mu\'minin means Mu'awiyah and his men.

> لاَ تَقْتُلُوا الْخَوَارِجَ بَعْدِي، فَلَيْسَ مَنْ طَلَبَ الْحَقَّ فَأَخْطَأَهُ، كَمَنْ طَلَبَ الْبَاطِلَ
> فَأَدْرَكَهُ.

> قال السيد الشريف: يعني معاوية وأصحابه.

-  The reason for
    stopping people from fighting the Kharijites was that Amir
    al-mu\'minin was clearly perceiving that after him authority and
    power would devolve on people who would be ignorant of the proper
    occasion of jihad, and who will make use of sword only to maintain
    their sway. And there were those who excelled even Kharijites in
    holding and calling Amir al-mu\'minin bad. So those who are
    themselves in the wrong have no right to fight others in the wrong.
    Again, those who are wilfully in the wrong can be allowed to fight
    those who are in the wrong by mistake. Thus, Amir al-mu\'minin\'s
    words make this fact clear that the misguidance of Kharijites was
    not wilful but under Satan\'s influence. They mistook wrong as right
    and stuck to it. On the other hand, the position of misguidance of
    Mu\`awiyah and his party was that they rejected right realising it
    as right and appropriated wrong as the code of their conduct fully
    knowing that it was wrong. Their audacity in the matter of religion
    reached the stage that it can neither be regarded as a result of
    misunderstanding nor can it be covered under the garb of error of
    judgement, because they openly transgressed the limits of religion
    and paid no heed to the Prophet\'s injunctions in comparison with
    their own view. Thus, Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid has written (vol. 5, p. 130)
    that when the Prophet\'s companion Abu\'d-Darda\' saw utensils of
    gold and silver being used by Mu\`awiyah he said he had heard the
    Prophet saying, \"One who drinks in vessels of gold and silver will
    feel flames of the fire of Hell in his stomach\" whereupon
    Mu\`awiyah said, \"As for me, l do not find any harm in it.\"
    Similarly, creating Ziyad ibn Abih\'s blood relationship with
    himself by his own opinion in total disregard of the Prophet\'s
    injunction, abusing the descendants of the Prophet over the pulpit,
    transgressing the limits of shari\`ah, shedding blood of innocent
    persons and placing over Muslims (as so called Khalifah) a vicious
    individual and thus opening the way to disbelief and atheism are
    events that to attribute them to any misunderstanding is like
    wilfully closing eyes to facts.]
