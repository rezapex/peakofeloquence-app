Amir al-mu'minin was delivering a lecture from the pulpit of (the mosque
of) Kufah when al-Ash'ath ibn
Qays{#epub.html_fref_2475b504_1
.see-footnote} objected and said, "O' Amir al-mu'minin this thing is not
in your favour but against
you."{#epub.html_fref_6b50a861_2
.see-footnote} Amir al-mu'minin looked at him with anger and said:

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> قاله للاشعث بن قيس وهو على منبر الكوفة يخطب

> فمضى في بعض كلامه شيء اعترضه الاشعث، فقال: يا أميرالمؤمنين، هذه عليك
> لا لك، فخفض (عليه السلام) إليه بصره ثم قال:

How do you know what is for me and what is against me?! Curse of Allah
and others be on you. You are a weaver and son of a weaver. You are the
son of an unbeliever and yourself a hypocrite. You were arrested once by
the Unbelievers and once by the Muslims, but your wealth and birth could
not save you from either. The man who contrives for his own people to be
put to sword and invites death and destruction for them does deserve
that the near ones should hate him and the remote ones should not trust
him.

> ومَا يُدْرِيكَ مَا عَلَيَّ مِمَّا لِي؟ عَلَيْكَ لَعْنَةُ اللهِ وَلَعْنَةُ اللاَّعِنِينَ! حَائِكٌ ابْنُ حَائِك!
> مُنَافِقٌ ابْنُ كُافِر! وَاللهِ لَقَدْ أَسَرَكَ الكُفْرُ مَرَّةً وَالاسْلامُ أُخْرَى! فَمَا فَداكَ مِنْ
> وَاحِدَة مِنْهُمَا مَالُكَ وَلاَ حَسَبُكَ! وَإِنَّ امْرَأً دَلَّ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ السَّيْفَ، وَسَاقَ إِلَيْهِمُ
> الحَتْفَ، لَحَرِيٌّ أَنْ يَمقُتَهُ الاْقْرَبُ، وَلاَ يَأْمَنَهُ الاْبْعَدُ!

**as-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** This man was arrested once when an
unbeliever and once in days of Islam. As for Amir al-mu'minin's words
that the man contrived for his own people to be put to sword, the
reference herein is to the incident which occurred to al-Ash'ath ibn
Qays in confrontation with Khalid ibn Walid at Yamamah, where he
deceived his people and contrived a trick till Khalid attacked them.
After this incident his people nicknamed him "'Urf an-Nar" which in the
parlance stood for traitor.

> قال السيد الشربف: يريد عليه السلام أنه أُسر في الكفر مرة وفي الاِسلام
> مرة . وأما قوله: «دل على قومه السيف»، فأراد به: حديثاً كان للاَشعث مع
> خالد بن الوليد باليمامة، غرّ فيه قومه ومكر بهم حتى أوقع بهم خالد، وكان
> قومه بعد ذلك يسمو نه «عُرْفَ النار»، وهو اسم للغادر عندهم.

\(1\) Abu al-Faraj, *al-\'Aghani,*VIII, 59.

-  His original name
    was Ma\`di Karib and surname Abu Muhammad but because of his
    dishevelled hair he is better known as al-Ash\`ath (one having
    dishevelled hair). When after Proclamation (of Prophethood) he came
    to Mecca along with his tribe, the Prophet invited him and his tribe
    to accept Islam. But all of them turned back without anyone
    accepting Islam. When after hijrah (migration of the Holy Prophet)
    Islam became established and in full swing and deputations began to
    come to Medina in large numbers he also came to the Prophet\'s
    audience with Banu Kindah and accepted Islam. The author of
    al-\`Isti\`ab writes that after the Prophet this man again turned
    unbeliever but when during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr he was brought
    to Medina as prisoner he again accepted Islam, though this time too
    his Islam was a show. Thus, ash-Shaykh Muhammad \`Abduh writes in
    his annotations on Nahjul Balaghah: Just as \`Abdullah ibn Ubay ibn
    Salul was a companion of the Prophet, al-Ash\`ath was a companion of
    \`Ali and both were high ranking hypocrites.\
    He lost one of his eyes in the battle of Yarmuk. Ibn Qutaybah has
    included him in the list of the one-eyed. Abu Bakr\'s sister Umm
    Farwah bint Abi Quhafah, who was once the wife of an al-Azdi and
    then of Tamim ad-Darimi, was on the third occasion married to this
    al-Ash\`ath. Three sons were born of her viz. Muhammad, Isma\`il and
    Is\'haq. Books on biography show that she was blind. Ibn
    Abi\'l-Hadid has quoted the following statement of Abu\'l-Faraj
    wherefrom it appears that this man was equally involved in the
    assassination of \`Ali (p.b.u.h.): On the night of the assassination
    Ibn Muljam came to al-Ash\`ath ibn Qays and both retired to a corner
    of the mosque and sat there when Hujr ibn \`Adi passed by that side
    and he heard al-Ash\`ath saying to Ibn Muljam, \"Be quick now or
    else dawn\'s light would disgrace you.\" On hearing this Hujr said
    to al-Ash\`ath, \"O\' one-eyed man, you are preparing to kill
    \'Ali\" and hastened towards \`Ali ibn Abi Talib, but Ibn Muljam had
    preceded him and struck \'Ali with sword when Hujr turned back
    people were crying, \"Ali has been killed.\"\
    It was his daughter who killed Imam Hasan (p.b.u.h.) by poisoning
    him. Mas\`udi has written that: His (Hasan\'s) wife Ja\`dah bint
    al-Ash\`ath poisoned him while Mu\`awiyah had conspired with her
    that if she could contrive to poison Hasan he would pay her one
    hundred thousand Dirhams and marry her to Yazid. (Muruj adh-dhahab,
    vol. 2, p. 650)\
    His son Muhammad ibn al-Ash\`ath was active in playing fraud with
    Hadrat Muslim ibn \`Aqil in Kufah and in shedding Imam Husayn\'s
    blood in Karbala. But despite all these points he is among those
    from whom al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi, an-Nasa\'i and
    Ibn Majah have related traditions.]
-  After the battle
    of Nahrawan, Amir al-mu\'minin was delivering a sermon in the mosque
    of Kufah about ill effects of \"Arbitration\" when a man stood up
    and said \"O\' Amir al-mu\'minin, first you desisted us from this
    Arbitration but thereafter you allowed it. We cannot understand
    which of these two was more correct and proper.\" On hearing this
    Amir al-mu\'minin clapped his one hand over the other and said,
    \"This is the reward of one who gives up firm view\" that is, this
    is the outcome of your actions as you had abandoned firmness and
    caution and insisted on \"Arbitration\" but al-Ash\`ath mistook it
    to mean as though Amir al mu\'minin implied that \"my worry was due
    to having accepted Arbitration,\" so he spoke out, \"O\' Amir
    al-mu\'minin this brings blame on your own self\" whereupon Amir
    al-mu\'minin said harshly: "What do you know what I am saying, and
    what do you understand what is for me or against me. You are a
    weaver and the son of a weaver brought up by unbelievers and a
    hypocrite. Curse of Allah and all the world be upon you."\
    Commentators have written several reasons for Amir al-mu\'minin
    calling Ash\`ath a weaver. First reason is, because he and his
    father like most of the people of his native place pursued the
    industry of weaving cloth. So, in order to refer to the lowliness of
    his occupation he has been called \'weaver\'. Yamanis had other
    occupations also but mostly this profession was followed among them.
    Describing their occupations Khalid ibn Safwan has mentioned this
    one first of all: "What can I say about a people among whom there
    are only weavers, leather dyers, monkey keepers and donkey riders.
    The hoopoe found them out, the mouse flooded them and a woman ruled
    over them". (al-Bayan wa\'t-tabyin, vol. 1, p. 130)\
    The second reason is that \"hiyakah\" means walking by bending on
    either side, and since out of pride and conceit this man used to
    walk shrugging his shoulders and making bends in his body, he has
    been called \"hayik\".\
    The third reason is \-\-- and it is more conspicuous and clear \-\--
    that he has been called a weaver to denote his foolishness and
    lowliness because every low person is proverbially known as a
    weaver. Their wisdom and sagacity can be well gauged by the fact
    that their follies had become proverbial, while nothing attains
    proverbial status without peculiar characteristics. Now, that Amir
    al-mu\'minin has also confirmed it no further argument or reasoning
    is needed.\
    The fourth reason is that by this is meant the person who conspires
    against Allah and the Holy Prophet and prepares webs of which is the
    peculiarity of hypocrites. Thus, in Wasa\'il ash-Shi\`ah (vol.
    12, p. 101) it is stated: It was mentioned before Imam Ja\`far
    as-Sadiq (p.b.u.h.) that the weaver is accursed when he explained
    that the weaver implies the person who concocts against Allah and
    the Prophet.\
    After the word weaver Amir al-mu\'minin has used the word hypocrite,
    and there is no conjunction in between them in order to emphasise
    the nearness of meaning thereof. Then, on the basis of this
    hypocrisy and concealment of truth he declared him deserving of the
    curse of Allah and all others, as Allah the Glorified says: Verily,
    those that conceal what we have sent of (Our) manifest evidences and
    guidance, after what we have (so) clearly shown for mankind in the
    Book (they are), those that Allah doth curse them and (also) curse
    them all those who curse (such ones). (Qur\'an, 2:159)\
    After this Amir al-mu\'minin says that \"You could not avoid the
    degradation of being prisoner when you were unbeliever, nor did
    these ignominies spare you after acceptance of Islam, and you were
    taken prisoner.\" When an unbeliever the event of his being taken
    prisoner occurred in this way that when the tribe of Banu Murad
    killed his father Qays, he (al-Ash\`ath) collected the warriors of
    Banu Kindah and divided them in three groups. Over one group he
    himself took the command, and on the others he placed Kabs ibn
    Hani\' and al-Qash\`am ibn Yazid al-Arqam as chiefs, and set off to
    deal with Banu Murad. But as misfortune would have it instead of
    Banu Murad he attacked Banu al-Harith ibn Ka\`b. The result was that
    Kabs ibn Hani\' and al-Qash\`am ibn Yazid al-Arqam were killed and
    this man was taken prisoner alive. Eventually he got a release by
    paying three thousand camels as ransom. In Amir al-mu\'minin\'s
    words, \"Your wealth or birth could not save you from either,\" the
    reference is not to real \'fidyah\' (release money) because he was
    actually released on payment of release money but the intention is
    that neither plenty of wealth nor his high position and prestige in
    his tribe could save him from this ignominy, and he could not
    protect himself from being a prisoner .\
    The event of his second imprisonment is that when the Holy Prophet
    of Islam passed away from this world a rebellion occurred in the
    region of Hadramawt for repelling which Caliph Abu Bakr wrote to the
    governor of the place Ziyad ibn Labid al-Bayadi. al-Ansari that he
    should secure allegiance and collect zakat and charities from those
    people. When Ziyad ibn Labid went to the tribe of Banu \`Amr ibn
    Mu\`awiyah for collection of zakat he took keen fancy for a
    she-camel of Shaytan ibn Hujr which was very handsome and of huge
    body. He jumped over it and took possession of it. Shaytan ibn Hujr
    did not agree to spare it and said to him to take over some other
    she-camel in its place but Ziyad would not agree. Shaytan sent for
    his brother al-\`Adda\' ibn Hujr for his support. On coming he too
    had a talk but Ziyad insisted on his point and did not, by any
    means, consent to keep off his hand from that she-camel. At last
    both these brothers appealed to Masruq ibn Ma\`di Karib for help.
    Consequently, Masruq also used his influence so that Ziyad might
    leave the she-camel but he refused categorically, whereupon Masruq
    became enthusiastic and untying the she-camel handed it over to
    Shaytan. On this Ziyad was infuriated and collecting his men became
    ready to fight. On the other side Banu Wali\`ah also assembled to
    face them, but could not defeat Ziyad and were badly beaten at his
    hands. Their women were taken away and property was looted.
    Eventually those who had survived were obliged to take refuge under
    the protection of al-Ash\`ath. Al-Ash\`ath promised assistance on
    the condition that he should be acknowledged ruler of the area.
    Those people agreed to this condition and his coronation was also
    formally solemnised. After having his authority acknowledged he
    arranged an army and set out to fight Ziyad. On the other side Abu
    Bakr had written to the chief of Yemen, al-Muhajir ibn Abi Umayyah
    to go for the help of Ziyad with a contingent. Al-Muhajir was coming
    with his contingent when they came face to face. Seeing each other
    they drew swords and commenced fighting at ad-Zurqan. In the end
    al-Ash\`ath fled from the battle-field and taking his remaining men
    closed himself in the fort of an-Nujayr. The enemy was such as to
    let them alone. They laid siege around the fort. Al-Ash\`ath thought
    how long could he remain shut up in the fort with this lack of
    equipment and men, and that he should think out some way of escape.
    So one night he stealthily came out of the fort and met Ziyad and
    al-Muhajir and conspired with them that if they gave asylum to nine
    members of his family he would get the fort gate opened. They
    accepted this term and asked him to write for them the names of
    those nine persons. He wrote down the nine names and made them over
    to them, but acting on his traditional wisdom forgot to write his
    own name in that list. After settling this he told his people that
    he has secured protection for them and the gate of the fort should
    be opened. When the gate was opened Ziyad forces pounced upon them.
    They said they had been promised protection whereupon Ziyad\'s army
    said that this was wrong and that al-Ash\`ath had asked protection
    only for nine members of his house, whose names preserved with them.
    In short eight hundred persons were put to sword and hands of
    several women were chopped off, while according to the settlement
    nine men were left off, but the case of al-Ash\`ath became
    complicated. Eventually it was decided he should be sent to Abu Bakr
    and he should decided about him. At last he was sent to Medina in
    chains along with a thousand women prisoners. On the way relations
    and others, men and women, all hurled curses at him and the women
    were calling him traitor and one who got his own people put to
    sword. Who else can be a greater traitor? However, when he reached
    Medina Abu Bakr released him and on that occasion he was married to
    Umm Farwah.]
