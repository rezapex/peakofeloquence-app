When people decided to swear
allegiance at Amir al-mu\'minin\'s hand after the murder of 'Uthman,
he said:

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> لمّا أراده الناس على البيعة بعد قتل عثمان

Leave me and seek some one else. We are facing a matter which has
(several) faces and colours, which neither hearts can stand nor
intelligence can accept. Clouds are hovering over the sky, and faces are
not discernible. You should know that if I respond to you I would lead
you as I know and would not listen to the utterance of any speaker or
the reproof of any reprover. If you leave me then I am the same as you
are. It is possible I would listen to and obey whomever you make in
charge of your affairs. I am better for you as a counsellor than as
chief.

> دَعُوني وَالْـتَمِسُوا غَيْرِي; فإِنَّا مُسْتَقْبِلُونَ أَمْراً لَهُ وُجُوهٌ وَأَلْوَانٌ; لاَ تَقُومُ لَهُ
> الْقُلُوبُ، وَلاَ تَثْبُتُ عَلَيْهِ الْعُقُولُ، وَإِنَّ الاْفَاقَ قَدْ أَغَامَتْ، وَالْـمَحَجَّةَ قَدْ تَنَكَّرَتْ.
> وَاعْلَمُوا أَنِّي إنْ أَجَبْتُكُمْ رَكِبْتُ بِكُمْ مَا أَعْلَمُ، وَلَمْ أُصْغِ إِلَى قَوْلِ الْقَائِلِ وَعَتْبِ
> الْعَاتِبِ، وَإِنْ تَرَكْتُمُونِي فَأَنَا كَأَحَدِكُمْ; وَلَعَلِّي أَسْمَعُكُمْ وَأَطْوَعُكُمْ لِمنْ وَلَّيْتُمُوهُ
> أَمْرَكُمْ، وَأَنَا لَكُمْ وَزِيراً، خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ مِنِّي أَمِيراً!

-  When with the
    murder of \`Uthman the seat of Caliphate became vacant, Muslims
    began to look at \`Ali (p.b.u.h.) whose peaceful conduct, adherence
    to principles, and politia lacumen had been witnessed by them to a
    great extent during this long period. Consequently, they rushed for
    swearing allegiance in the same way as a traveller who had lost his
    way and catches sight of the objective would have rushed towards it,
    as the historian at-Tabari (in at-Tarikh, vol .I, pp. 3066,
    3067, 3076) records:\
    People thronged on Amir al-mu\'minin and said, \"We want to swear
    allegiance to you and you see what troubles are befalling Islam and
    how we are being tried about the near ones of the Prophet.\"\
    But Amir al-mu\'minin declined to accede to their request whereupon
    these people raised a hue and cry and began to shout loudly, \"O\'
    Abu\'l-Hasan, do you not witness the ruination of Islam or see the
    advancing flood of unruliness and mischief? Do you have no fear of
    Allah?\" Even then Amir al-mu\'minin showed no readiness to consent
    because he was noticing that the effects of the atmosphere that had
    come into being after the Prophet had overcome hearts and minds of
    the people, selfishness and lust for power had become rooted in
    them, their thinking affected by materialism and they had become
    habituated to treating government as the means for securing their
    ends. Now they would like to materialise the Divine Caliphate too
    and play with it. In these circumstances it would be impossible to
    change the mentalities or turn the direction of temperaments. In
    addition to these ideas he had also seen the end in view that these
    people should get further time to think over so that on frustration
    of their material ends hereafter they should not say that the
    allegiance had been sworn by them under a temporary expediency and
    that thought had not been given to it, just as \`Umar\'s idea was
    about the first Caliphate, which appears from his statement that:\
    Abu Bakr\'s Caliphate came into being without thought but Allah
    saved us from its mischief. If anyone repeats such an affair you
    should kill him. (as-Sahih, al-Bukhari, vol 8, pp.210, 211;
    al-Musnad, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, vol.1, p.55; at-Tabari, vol.1, p.l822;
    Ibn al-Athir, vol.2, p.327; Ibn Hisham, vol.4, pp.308-309; Ibn
    Kathir, vol.5, p.246)\
    In short, when their insistence increased beyond limits, Amir
    al-mu\'minin delivered this sermon wherein he clarified that \"If
    you want me for your worldly ends, then I am not ready to serve as
    your instrument. Leave me and select someone else who may fulfil
    your ends. You have seen my past life that I am not prepared to
    follow anything except the Qur\'an and sunnah and would not give up
    this principle for securing power. If you select someone else I
    would pay regard to the laws of the state and the constitution as a
    peaceful citizen should do. I have not at any stage tried to disrupt
    the collective existence of the Muslims by inciting revolt. The same
    will happen now. Rather, just as keeping the common good in view I
    have hitherto been giving correct advice, I would not grudge doing
    the same. If you let me in the same position it would be better for
    your worldly ends, because in that case I won\'t have power in my
    hands so that I could stand in the way of your worldly affairs, and
    create an impediment against your hearts\' wishes. However, if you
    are determined on swearing allegiance on my hand, bear in mind that
    if you frown or speak against me I would force you to tread on the
    path of right, and in the matter of the right I would not care for
    anyone. If you want to swear allegiance even at this, you can
    satisfy your wish.\" The impression Amir al-mu\'minin had formed
    about these people is fully corroborated by later events.
    Consequently, when those who had sworn allegiance with worldly
    motives did not succeed in their objectives they broke away and rose
    against his government with baseless
    allegations.]
