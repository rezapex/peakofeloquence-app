*Condemning the people of Basrah \[after the battle of Jamal\]*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> في ذم البصرة وأهلها \[بعد وقعة الجمل\]

You were the army of a woman and in the command of a quadruped. When it
grumbled you responded, and when it was wounded (hamstrung) you fled
away. Your character is low and your pledge is broken. Your faith is
hypocrisy. Your water is brackish. He who stays with you is laden with
sins and he who forsakes you secures Allah's mercy. It is as though I
see your mosque prominent, resembling the surface of a boat, while Allah
has sent chastisement from above and from below it and everyone who is
on it is drowned.{#epub.html_fref_ff99d5ff_2

> كُنْتُمْ جُنْدَ الْمَرْأَةِ، وَأَتْبَاعَ البَهِيمَةِ رَغَافَأَجَبْتُم، وَعُقِرَفَهَرَبْتُمْ. أَخْلاَقُكُمْ دِقَاقٌ
> وَعَهْدُكُمْ شِقَاقٌ، وَدِيْنُكُمْ نِفَاقٌ، وَمَاؤُكُمْ زُعَاقٌ المُقِيمُ بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِكُمْ مُرْتَهَنٌ بِذَنْبِهِ،
> وَالشَّاخِصُ عَنْكُمْ مُتَدَارَكٌ بِرَحْمةٍ مِنْ رَبِّهِ. كَأَنِّي بِمَسْجِدكُمْ كَجُؤْجُؤِ سَفِينَةٍ قَدْ بَعَثَ اللهُ
> عَلَيْها العَذَابَ مِنْ فَوْقِها وَمِنْ تَحتِها، وَغَرِقَ مَنْ في ضِمْنِها

## Another version

By Allah, your city would certainly be drowned so much so that as though
I see its mosque like the upper part of a boat or a sitting ostrich.

> وفي رواية:

> وَأيْمُ اللهِ لَتَغْرَقَنَّ بَلْدَتُكُمْ حَتَّى كَأَنِّي أَنْظُرُ إِلى مَسْجِدِهَا كَجُؤْجُؤِ سَفِينَةٍ، أَوْ نَعَامَةٍ
> جَاثِمَةٍ

## Another version

Like the bosom of a bird in deep sea.

> وفي رواية أخرى:

> كَجُؤْجُؤِ طَيْرٍ في لُجَّةِ بَحْرٍ

## Another version

Your city is the most stinking of all the cities as regards its clay,
the nearest to water and remotest from the sky. It contains nine tenths
of evil. He who enters it is surrounded with his sins and he who is out
of it enjoys Allah's forgiveness. It seems as though I look at this
habitation of yours that water has so engulfed it that nothing can be
seen of it except the highest part of mosque appearing like the bosom of
a bird in deep sea.

> و في رواية:

> بلادكم أنتن بلاد الله تربةً: أقربها من الماء و أبعدها من السماء . و بها
> تسعة اعشار الشر، المحتَبَس فيها بِذنبِهِ ، و الخارج بِعفوِ اللهِ . كأنّي أنظر
> الى قريتكم هذه قد طبَّقَها الماء ، حتّى ما يرى منها الّا شُرُف المسجد ، كأنه
> جؤجؤ طير في لجة بحر.

-  Ibn Maytham
    writes that when the Battle of Jamal ended then on the third day
    after it Amir al-mu\'minin said the morning prayer in the central
    mosque of Basrah and after finishing it stood on the right side of
    the prayer place reclining against the wall and delivered this
    sermon wherein he described the lowness of character of the people
    of Basrah and their slyness, namely that they got enflamed at
    others\' instigation without anything of their own and making over
    their command to a woman clung to a camel. They broke away after
    swearing allegiance and exhibited their low character and evil
    nature by practising double facedness. In this sermon woman implies
    \`A\'ishah and quadruped implies the camel (Jamal) after which this
    battle has been named the Battle of
    Jamal.\']

    This battle originated in this way that when although during the
    life time of \`Uthman, \`A\'ishah used to oppose him and had left
    for Mecca leaving him in siege and as such she had a share in his
    assassination details of which would be stated at some suitable
    place but when on her return from Mecca towards Medina she heard
    from \`Abdullah ibn Salamah that after \`Uthman allegiance had been
    paid to \`Ali (as Caliph) she suddenly exclaimed, \"If allegiance
    has been paid to \`Ali, I wish the sky had burst on the earth. Let
    me go back to Mecca.\" Consequently she decided to return to Mecca
    and began saying, \"By Allah \`Uthman has been killed helplessly. I
    shall certainly avenge his blood.\"

    On seeing this wide change in the state of affairs Abu Salamah said,
    \"What are you saying as you yourself used to say \"Kill this
    Na\`thal ; he had turned unbeliever.\" Thereupon she replied, \"Not
    only I but everyone used to say so; but leave these things and
    listen to what I am now saying, that is better and deserves more
    attention. It is so strange that first he was called upon to repent
    but before giving him an opportunity to do so he has been killed.\"
    On this Abu Salamah recited the following verses addressing her:

    You started it and now you are changing and raising storms of wind
    and rain.\
    You ordered for his killing and told us that he had turned
    unbeliever.\
    We admit that he has been killed but under your orders and the real
    Killer is one who ordered it.\
    Nevertheless, neither the sky fell over us nor did the sun and moon
    fall into eclipse.\
    Certainly people have paid allegiance to one who can ward off the
    enemy with power and grandeur, does not allow swords to come near
    him and loosens the twist of the rope, that is, subdues the enemy.\
    He is always fully armed for combat and the faithful is never like
    the traitor.

    However, when she reached Mecca with a passion for vengeance she
    began rousing the people to avenge \`Uthman\'s blood by circulating
    stories of his having been victimised. The first to respond to this
    call was \`Abdullah ibn \`Amir al-Hadrami who had been the governor
    of Mecca in \`Uthman\'s reign and with him Marwan ibn al-Hakam,
    Sa\`id ibn al-\`As and other Umayyads rose to support her. On the
    other side Talhah ibn \`Ubaydillah and az-Zubayr ibn al-\`Awwam also
    reached Mecca from Medina. From Yemen Ya\`la ibn Munabbih who had
    been governor there during \`Uthman\'s caliphate and the former
    governor of Basrah, \`Abdullah ibn \`Amir ibn Kurayz also reached
    there, and joining together began preparing their plans.

    Battle had been decided upon but discussion was about the venue of
    confrontation. \`A\'ishah\'s opinion was to make Medina the venue of
    the battle but some people opposed and held that it was difficult to
    deal with Medinites, and that some other place should be chosen as
    the venue. At last after much discussion it was decided to march
    towards Basrah as there was no dearth of men to support the cause.
    Consequently on the strength of \`Abdullah ibn \`Amir\'s countless
    wealth, and the offer of six hundred thousand Dirhams and six
    hundred camels by Ya\`la ibn Munabbih they prepared an army of three
    thousand and set off to Basrah. There was a small incident on the
    way on account of which \`A\'ishah refused to advance further.

    What happened was that at a place she heard the barking of dogs and
    enquired from the camel driver the name of the place. He said it was
    Haw\'ab. On hearing this name she recalled the Prophet\'s admonition
    when he had said to his wives, \"I wish I could know at which of you
    the dogs of Haw\'ab would bark.\" So when she realised that she
    herself was that one she got the camel seated by patting and
    expressed her intention to abandon the march. But the device of her
    companions saved the deteriorating situation. \`Abdullah ibn
    az-Zubayr swore to assure her that it was not Haw\'ab, Talhah
    seconded him and for her further assurance also sent for fifty
    persons to stand witness to it. When all the people were on one side
    what could a single woman do by opposing. Eventually they were
    successful and \`A\'ishah resumed her forward march with the same
    enthusiasm.

    When this army reached Basrah, people were first amazed to see the
    riding animal of \`A\'ishah. Jariyah ibn Qudamah came forward and
    said, \"O\' mother of the faithful, the assassination of \`Uthman
    was one tragedy but the greater tragedy is that you have come out on
    this cursed camel and ruined your honour and esteem. It is better
    that you should get back.\" But since neither the incident at
    Haw\'ab could deter her nor could the Qur\'anic injunction: \"Keep
    sitting in your houses\" (33:33) stop her, what effect could these
    voices produce. Consequently, she disregarded all this.

    When this army tried to enter the city the Governor of Basrah
    \`Uthman ibn Hunayf came forward to stop them and when the two
    parties came face to face they drew their swords out of the sheaths
    and pounced upon each other. When a good number had been killed from
    either side \`A\'ishah intervened on the basis of her influence and
    the two groups agreed that till the arrival of Amir al-mu\'minin the
    existing administration should continue and \`Uthman ibn Hunayf
    should continue on his post. But only two days had elapsed when they
    made a nightly attack on \`Uthman ibn Hunayf, killed forty innocent
    persons, beat \`Uthman ibn Hunayf, plucked every hair of his beard,
    took him in their custody and shut him up. Then they attacked public
    treasury and while ransacking it killed twenty persons on the spot,
    and beheaded fifty more after arresting them.

    Then they attacked the grain store, whereupon an elderly noble of
    Basrah Hukaym ibn Jabalah could not control himself and reaching
    there with his men said to \`Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr, \"Spare some of
    this grain for the city\'s populace. After all there should be a
    limit to oppression. You have spread killing and destruction all
    round and put \`Uthman ibn Hunayf in confinement. For Allah\'s sake
    keep off these ruining activities and release \`Uthman ibn Hunayf.
    Is there no fear of Allah in your hearts?\" Ibn az-Zubayr said,
    \"This is vengeance of \`Uthman\'s life.\" Hukaym ibn Jabalah
    retorted, \"Were those who have been killed assassins of \`Uthman?
    By Allah, if I had supporters and comrades I should have certainly
    avenged the blood of these Muslims whom you have killed without
    reason.\" Ibn az-Zubayr replied, \"We shall not give anything out of
    this grain, nor will \`Uthman ibn Hunayf be released.\" At last the
    battle raged between these two parties but how could a few
    individuals deal with such a big force? The result was that Hukaym
    ibn Jabalah, his son al-Ashraf ibn Hukaym ibn Jabalah, his brother
    ar-Ri\'l ibn Jabalah and seventy persons of his tribe were killed.
    In short, killing and looting prevailed all round. Neither anyone\'s
    life was secure nor was there any way to save one\'s honour or
    property.

    When Amir al-mu\'minin was informed of the march to Basrah he set
    out to stop it with a force which consisted of seventy of those who
    had taken part in the battle of Badr and four hundred out of those
    companions who had the honour of being present at the Allegiance of
    Ridwan (Divine Pleasure). When he stopped at the stage of Dhiqar he
    sent his son Hasan (p.b.u.h.) and \`Ammar ibn Yasir to Kufah to
    invite its people to fighting. Consequently, despite interference of
    Abu Musa al-Ash\`ari seven thousand combatants from there joined
    Amir al- mu\'minin\'s army. He left that place after placing the
    army under various commanders.

    Eye witnesses state that when this force reached near Basrah first
    of all a contingent of ansar appeared foremost. Its standard was
    held by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari. After it appeared another contingent of
    1000 whose commander was Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al-Ansari. Then
    another contingent came in sight. Its standard was borne by Abu
    Qatadah ibn ar-Rabi\`. Then a crowd of a thousand old and young
    persons was seen. They had signs of prostration on their foreheads
    and veil of fear of Allah on their face. It seemed as if they were
    standing before the Divine Glory on the Day of Judgement. Their
    Commander rode a dark horse, was dressed in white, had black turban
    on his head and was reciting the Qur\'an loudly. This was \`Ammar
    ibn Yasir. Then another contingent appeared. Its standard was in the
    hand of Qays ibn Sa\`d ibn \`Ubadah.

    Then an army came to sight. Its leader wore white dress and had a
    black turban on his head. He was so handsome that all eyes centred
    around him. This was \`Abdullah ibn \`Abbas. Then followed a
    contingent of the companions of the Prophet. Their standard bearer
    was Qutham ibn al-\`Abbas. Then after the passing of a few
    contingents a big crowd was seen, wherein there was such a large
    number of spears that they were overlapping and flags of numerous
    colours were flying. Among them a big and lofty standard was seen
    with distinctive position. Behind it was seen a rider guarded by
    sublimity and greatness. His sinews were well-developed and eyes
    were cast downwards. His awe and dignity was such that no one could
    look at him. This was the Ever Victorious Lion of Allah namely \`Ali
    ibn Abi Talib (p.b.u.h.).

    On his right and left were Hasan and Husayn (p.b.u.t.). In front of
    him Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah walked in slow steps carrying the
    banner of victory and glory, and on the back were the young men of
    Banu Hashim, the people of Badr and \`Abdullah ibn Ja\`far ibn Abi
    Talib. When this army reached the place az-Zawiyah, Amir
    al-mu\'minin alighted from the horse, and after performing four
    rak\`ah of prayer put his cheeks on the ground. When he lifted his
    head the ground was drenched with tears and the tongue was uttering
    these words: O\' Sustainer of earth, heaven and the high firmament,
    this is Basrah. Fill our lap with its good and protect us from its
    evils.\
    Then proceeding forward he got down in the battle-field of Jamal
    where the enemy was already camping. First of all Amir al-mu\'minin
    announced in his army that no one should attack another, nor take
    the initiative. Saying this he came in front of the opposite army
    and said to Talhah and az-Zubayr, \"You ask \`A\'ishah by swearing
    in the name of Allah and His prophet whether I am not free from the
    blame of \`Uthman\'s blood, and whether I used the same words for
    him which you used to say, and whether I pressurised you for
    allegiance or you swore it of your own free will.\" Talhah got
    exasperated at these words but az-Zubayr relented, and Amir
    al-mu\'minin turned back after it, and giving the Qur\'an to Muslim
    (a young man from the tribe of \`Abd Qays) sent him towards them to
    pronounce to them the verdict of the Qur\'an. But people took both
    of them within aim and covered this godly man with their arrows.

    Then \`Ammar ibn Yasir went to canvass and convince them and caution
    them with the consequences of war but his words were also replied by
    arrows. Till now Amir al-mu\'minin had not allowed an attack as a
    result of which the enemy continued feeling encouraged and went on
    raining arrows constantly. At last with the dying of a few valiant
    combatants consternation was created among Amir al-mu\'minin\'s
    ranks and some people came with a few bodies before him and said,
    \"O\' Commander of the faithful you are not allowing us to fight
    while they are covering us with arrows. How long can we let them
    make our bosoms the victim of their arrows, and remain handfolded at
    their excesses?\"

    At this Amir al-mu\'minin did show anger but acting with restraint
    and endurance, came to the enemy in that very form without wearing
    armour or any arm and shouted, \"Where is az-Zubayr?\" At first
    az-Zubayr hesitated to come forward but he noticed that Amir
    al-mu\'minin had no arms he came out. Amir al-mu\'minin said to him
    \"O\' az-Zubayr, you must remember that one day the Prophet told you
    that you would fight with me and wrong and excess would be on your
    side.\" az-Zubayr replied that he had said so. Then Amir
    al-mu\'minin enquired \"Why have you come then?\" He replied that
    his memory had missed it and if he had recollected it earlier he
    would not have come that way. Amir al-mu\'minin said, \"Well, now
    you have recollected it\" and he replied, \"Yes.\" Saying this he
    went straight to \`A\'ishah and told her that he was getting back.

    She asked him the reason and he replied, \"\`Ali has reminded me a
    forgotten matter. I had gone astray, but now I have come on the
    right path and would not fight \`Ali ibn Abi Talib at any cost.\"
    \`A\'ishah said, \"You have caught fear of the swords of the sons of
    \`Abd al-Muttalib.\" He said, \"No\" and saying this he turned the
    reins of his horse. However, it is gratifying that some
    consideration was accorded to the Prophet\'s saying, for at Haw\'ab
    even after recollection of the Prophet\'s words no more than
    transient effect was taken of it. On returning after this
    conversation Amir al-mu\'minin observed that they had attacked the
    right and left flanks of his army. Noticing this Amir al-mu\'minin
    said, \"Now the plea has been exhausted. Call my son Muhammad.\"
    When he came Amir al-mu\'minin said, \"My son, attack them now.\"

    Muhammad bowed his head and taking the standard proceeded to the
    battle-field. But arrows were falling in such exuberance that he had
    to stop. When Amir al-mu\'minin saw this he called out at him,
    \"Muhammad, why don\'t you advance?\" He said, \"Father, in this
    shower of arrows there is no way to proceed. Wait till the violence
    of arrows subsides.\" He said, \"No, thrust yourself in the arrows
    and spears and attack.\" Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah advanced a
    little but the archers so surrounded him that he had to hold his
    steps. On seeing this a frown appeared on Amir al-mu\'minin\'s
    fore-head and getting forward he hit the sword\'s handle on the
    Muhammad\'s back and said, \"This is the effect of your mother\'s
    veins.\"

    Saying this he took the standard from his hands and folding up his
    sleeves made such and attack that a tumult was created in the
    enemy\'s ranks from one end to the other. To whichever row he
    turned, it became clear and to whatever side he directed himself
    bodies were seen falling and heads rolling in the hoofs of horses.
    When after convulsing the rows he returned to his position he said
    to Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, \"Look, my son, battle is fought like
    this.\" Saying this he gave the standard to him and ordered him to
    proceed. Muhammad advanced towards the enemy with a contingent of
    ansar. The enemy also came out moving and balancing their spears.
    But the brave son of the valiant father convulsed rows over rows
    while the other warriors also made the battle-field glory and left
    heaps of dead bodies.

    From the other side also there was full demonstration of spirit of
    sacrifice. Dead bodies were falling one over the other but they
    continued sacrificing their lives devotedly around the camel.
    Particularly the condition of Banu Dabbah was that although their
    hands were being severed from the elbows for holding the reins of
    the camel, and bosoms were being pierced yet they had the following
    battle-song on their tongues: a) To us death is sweeter than honey.
    We are Banu Dabbah, camel rearers. b) We are sons of death when
    death comes. We announce the death of \`Uthman with the edges of
    spears. c) Give us back our chief and there is an end to it.

    The low character and ignorance from faith of these Banu Dabbah, can
    be well understood by that one incident which al-Mada\'ini has
    narrated. He writes that in Basrah there was a man with mutilated
    ear. He asked him its reason when he said, \"I was watching the
    sight of dead bodies in the battle-field of Jamal when I saw a
    wounded man who sometimes raised his head and sometimes dashed it
    back on the ground. I approached near. Then the following two verses
    were on his lips: a) Our mother pushed us into the deep waters of
    death and did not get back till we had thoroughly drunk. b) By
    misfortune we obeyed Banu Taym who are none but slave men and slave
    girls.

    \"I told him it was not the time to recite verses; he should rather
    recall Allah and recite the kalimat ash-shahadah (verse of
    testimony). On my saying this he saw me with angry looks and
    uttering a severe abuse and said, \"You are asking me to recite
    kalimat ash-shahadah, get frightened at the last moment and show
    impatience.\" I was astonished to hear this and decided to return
    without saying anything further. When he saw me returning he said,
    \"Wait; for your sake I am prepared to recite, but teach me.\" I
    drew close to teach him the kalimah when he asked me to get closer.
    When I got closer he caught my ear with his teeth and did not leave
    it till he tore it from the root. I did not think it proper to
    molest a dying man and was about to get back abusing and cursing him
    when he asked me to listen one more thing. I agreed to listen lest
    he had an unsatisfied wish. He said that when I should get to my
    mother and she enquired who had bitten my ear I should say that it
    was done by \`Umayr ibn al-Ahlab ad-Dabbi who had been deceived by a
    woman aspiring to become the commander of the faithful (head of the
    state).\"

    However, when the dazzling lightning of swords finished the lives of
    thousands of persons and hundreds of Banu Azd and Banu Dabbah were
    killed for holding the rein of the camel, Amir al-mu\'minin ordered,
    \"Kill the camel for it is Satan.\" Saying this he made such a
    severe attack that the cries of \"Peace\" and \"Protection\" rose
    from all round. When he reached near the camel he ordered Bujayr ibn
    Duljah to kill the camel at once. Consequently, Bujayr hit him with
    such full might that the camel fell in agony on the side of its
    bosom. No sooner than the camel fell the opposite army took to heels
    and the carrier holding \`A\'ishah was left lonely and unguarded.
    The companion of Amir al-mu\'minin took control of the carrier and
    under orders of Amir al-mu\'minin, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr escorted
    \`A\'ishah to the house of Safiyyah bint al-Harith.

    This encounter commenced on the 10th of Jumada ath-thaniyah, 36
    A.H., in the afternoon and came to an end the same evening. In it
    from Amir al-mu\'minin\'s army of twenty two thousand, one thousand
    and seventy or according to another version five hundred persons
    were killed as martyrs while from \`A\'ishah\'s army of thirty
    thousand, seventeen thousand persons were killed, and the Prophet\'s
    saying, \"That people who assigned their affairs (of state) to a
    woman would never prosper\" was fully corroborated. (al-Imamah
    wa\'s-siyasah; Muruj adh-dhahab; al-\`Iqd al-farid; at-Tarikh, at
    Tabari)

-  Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid
    has written that as prophesied by Amir al-mu\'minin, Basrah was
    flooded twice - once in the days of al-Qadir Bi'llah and once in the
    reign of al-Qa\'im bi Amri\'l-lah and the state of flooding was just
    this that while the whole city was under water but the top ends of
    the mosque were seen about the surface of the water and looked like
    a bird sitting on the side of its bosom.]
