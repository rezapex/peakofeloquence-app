*Delivered on return from Siffin*

## Arabia before proclamation of Prophethood

> ومن خطبة له ) عليه السلام (بعد انصرافه من صفين

> وفيها حال الناس قبل البعثة وصفة آل النبي ثمّ صفة قوم آخرين:

I praise Allah seeking completion of His Blessing, submitting to His
Glory and expecting safety from committing His sins. I invoke His help
being in need of His Sufficiency (of protection). He whom He guides does
not go astray, He with whom He is hostile gets no protection. He whom He
supports does not remain needy. Praise is most weighty of all that is
weighed and the most valuable of all that is treasured.

> أحْمَدُهُ اسْتِتْماماً لِنِعْمَتِهِ، وَاسْتِسْلاَماً لِعِزَّتِهِ، واسْتِعْصَاماً مِنْ مَعْصِيَتِهِ، وَأَسْتَعِينُهُ
> فَاقَةً إِلى كِفَايَتِهِ، إِنَّهُ لاَ يَضِلُّ مَنْ هَدَاهُ، وَلا يَئِلُ مَنْ عَادَاهُ، وَلا يَفْتَقِرُ مَنْ
> كَفَاهُ; فَإِنَّهُ أَرْجَحُ ما وُزِنَ، وَأَفْضَلُ مَا خُزِنَ.

I stand witness that there is no god but Allah the One. He has no like.
My testimony has been tested in its frankness, and its essence is our
belief. We shall cling to it for ever till we live and shall store it
for facing the tribulations that overtake us because it is the
foundation stone of Belief *(iman)* and the first step towards good
actions and Divine pleasure. It is the means to keep Satan away.

> وَأَشْهَدُ أَنْ لاَ إِلهَ إِلاَّ اللهُ، شَهَادَةً مُمْتَحَناً إِخْلاَصُهَا، مُعْتَقَداً مُصَاصُهَا، نَتَمَسَّكُ
> بها أَبَداً ما أَبْقانَا، وَنَدَّخِرُهَا لاِهَاوِيلِ مَا يَلْقَانَا، فَإِنَّها عَزيمَةُ الاْيمَانِ،
> وَفَاتِحَةُ الاْحْسَانِ، وَمَرْضَاةُ الرَّحْمنِ، وَمَدْحَرَةُ الشَّيْطَانِ.

I also stand witness that Muhammad (S) is His slave and His Prophet.
Allah sent him with the illustrious religion, effective emblem, written
Book, effulgent light, sparkling gleam and decisive injunction
in order to dispel doubts, present clear proofs, administer warning
through signs and to warn of punishments. At that time people had fallen
in vices whereby the rope of religion had been broken, the pillars of
belief had been shaken, principles had been sacrileged, system had
become topsy turvy, openings were narrow, passage was dark, guidance was
unknown and darkness prevailed.

> وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ، أرْسَلَهُ بِالدِّينِ المشْهُورِ، وَالعَلَمِ المأْثُورِ،
> وَالكِتَابِ المسْطُورِ، وَالنُّورِ السَّاطِعِ، وَالضِّيَاءِ اللاَّمِعِ، وَالاَمْرِ الصَّادِعِ، إزَاحَةً
> لِلشُّبُهَاتِ، وَاحْتِجَاجاً بِالبَيِّنَاتِ، وَتَحْذِيراً بِالايَاتِ، وَتَخْويفاً بِالمَثُلاَتِ، وَالنَّاسُ
> في فِتَن انْجَذَمَ فِيها حَبْلُ الدِّينِ، وَتَزَعْزَعَتْ سَوَارِي اليَقِينِ، وَاخْتَلَفَ النَّجْرُ، وَتَشَتَّتَ
> الاْمْرُ، وَضَاقَ الْـمَخْرَجُ، وَعَمِيَ المَصْدَرُ، فَالهُدَى خَامِلٌ، واَلعَمَى شَامِلٌ.

Allah was being disobeyed, Satan was given support and Belief had been
forsaken. As a result the pillars of religion fell down, its traces
could not be discerned, its passages had been destroyed and its streets
had fallen into decay. People obeyed Satan and treaded his paths. They
sought water from his watering places. Through them Satan's emblems got
flying and his standard was raised in vices which trampled the people
under their hoofs, and treaded upon them with their feet. The vices
stood on their toes (in full stature) and the people immersed in them
were strayed, perplexed, ignorant and seduced as though in a good
house with bad neighbours. Instead of sleep they had
wakefulness and for antimony they had tears in the eyes. They were in a
land where the learned were in bridle (keeping their mouths shut) while
the ignorant were honoured.

> عُصِيَ الرَّحْمنُ، وَنُصِرَ الشَّيْطَانُ، وَخُذِلَ الاِْيمَانُ، فَانْهَارَتْ دَعَائِمُهُ، وَتَنكَّرَتْ مَعَالِمُهُ،
> وَدَرَسَتْ سُبُلُهُ، وَعَفَتْ شُرُكُهُ.

> أَطَاعُوا الشَّيْطَانَ فَسَلَكُوا مَسَالِكَهُ، وَوَرَدُوا مَنَاهِلَهُ، بِهِمْ سَارَتْ أَعْلامُهُ، وَقَامَ
> لِوَاؤُهُ، في فِتَن دَاسَتْهُمْ بِأَخْفَافِهَا، وَوَطِئَتْهُمْ بأَظْلاَفِهَا وَقَامَتْ عَلَى سَنَابِكِهَا، فَهُمْ
> فِيهَا تَائِهُونَ حَائِرونَ جَاهِلُونَ مَفْتُونُونَ، في خَيْرِ دَار، وَشَرِّ جِيرَان، نَوْمُهُمْ سُهُودٌ،
> وَكُحْلُهُمْ دُمُوعٌ، بأَرْض عَالِمُها مُلْجَمٌ، وَجَاهِلُها مُكْرَمٌ.

## In the same sermon Amir al-mu'minin referred to Al an-Nabi (the Household of the Holy Prophet) as under

> ومنها: ويعني آل النبي ( صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم)

They are the trustees of His secrets, shelter for His affairs, source of
knowledge about Him, centre of His wisdom, valleys for His books and
mountains of His religion. With them Allah straightened the bend of
religion's back and removed the trembling of its limbs.

> هُمْ مَوْضِعُ سِرِّهِ، وَلَجَأُ أَمْرِهِ، وَعَيْبَةُ عِلْمِهِ، وَمَوْئِلُ حُكْمِهِ، وَكُهُوفُ كُتُبِهِ، وَجِبَالُ
> دِينِه، بِهِمْ أَقَامَ انْحِناءَ ظَهْرِهِ، وَأذْهَبَ ارْتِعَادَ فَرَائِصِهِ.

## In the same Sermon he spoke about the hypocrites

> منها: يعني بها قوماً آخرين

They sowed vices, watered them with deception and harvested destruction.

> زَرَعُوا الفُجُورَ، وَسَقَوْهُ الغُرُورَ، وَحَصَدُوا الثُّبُورَ ،

## Ali Muhammad

> آل محمد (عليه السلام)

None in the Islamic community can be taken at par with the
Progeny of the Prophet (Ali Muhammad). One who was under their
obligation cannot be matched with them. They are the foundation of
religion and pillar of Belief. The forward runner has to turn back to
them while the follower has to overtake them. They possess the chief
characteristics for vicegerency. In their favour exists the will and
succession (of the Prophet). This is the time when right has returned to
its owner and diverted to its centre of return.

> لا يُقَاسُ بِآلِ مُحَمَّد (عليهم السلام) مِنْ هذِهِ الاُمَّةِ أَحَدٌ، وَلا يُسَوَّى بِهِمْ مَنْ جَرَتْ
> نِعْمَتُهُمْ عَلَيْهِ أبَداً.

> هُمْ أَسَاسُ الدِّينِ، وَعِمَادُ اليَقِينِ، إِلَيْهمْ يَفِيءُ الغَالي، وَبِهِمْ يَلْحَقُ التَّالي، وَلَهُمْ
> خَصَائِصُ حَقِّ الوِلايَةِ، وَفِيهِمُ الوَصِيَّةُ وَالوِرَاثَةُ، الاْنَ إِذْ رَجَعَ الحَقُّ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ،
> وَنُقِلَ إِلَى مُنْتَقَلِهِ.

    Record.]

-  Good House means
    'Mecca' while the bad neighbours mean the 'Unbelievers of
    Quraysh.']

-  About the Progeny
    of the Prophet Amir al-mu\'minin has said that no person in the
    world can be brought at par with them, nor can any one be deemed
    their equal in sublimity, because the world is overladen with their
    obligations and has been able to secure eternal blessings only
    through their guidance. They are the corner stone and foundation of
    religion and the sustenance for its life and survival. They are such
    strong pillars of knowledge and belief that they can turn away the
    stormy flow of doubt and suspicion.]

    They are such middle course among the paths of excess and
    backwardness that if some one goes far towards excess and
    exaggeration or falls behind then unless he comes back or steps
    forward to that middle course he cannot be on the path of Islam.
    They possess all the characteristics which give the superiority in
    the right for vicegerency and leadership. Consequently, no one else
    in the ummah enjoys the right of patronage and guardianship. That is
    why the Prophet declared them his vicegerents and successors. About
    will and succession the commentator Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid Mu\`tazili
    writes that there can be no doubt about the vicegerency of Amir
    al-mu\'minin but succession cannot imply succession in position
    although the Shi\`ite sect has so interpreted it. It rather implies
    succession of learning.

    Now, if according to him succession is taken to imply succession in
    learning even he does not seem to succeed in achieving his object,
    because even by this interpretation the right of succeeding the
    Prophet does not devolve on any other person. When it is agreed that
    learning is the most essential requirement of khilafah (caliphate)
    because the most important functions of the Prophet\'s Caliph
    consist of dispensation of justice, solving problems of religious
    laws, clarifying intricacies and administration of religious
    penalties. If these functions are taken away from the Prophet\'s
    deputy his position will come down to that of a worldly ruler. He
    cannot be regarded as the pivot of religious authority. Therefore
    either we should keep governmental authority separate from
    Prophet\'s vicegerency or accept the successor of Prophet\'s
    knowledge to suit that position.

    The interpretation of Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid could be acceptable if Amir
    al-mu\'minin had uttered this sentence alone, but observing that it
    was uttered soon after \`Ali\'s (p.b.u.h.) recognition as Caliph and
    just after it the sentence \"Right has returned to its owner\"
    exists, this interpretation of his seems baseless. Rather, the
    Prophet\'s will cannot imply any other will except that for
    vicegerency and caliphate, and succession would imply not succession
    in property nor in knowledge because this was not an occasion to
    mention it here but it must mean the succession in the right
    leadership which stood proved as from Allah not only on the ground
    of kinship but on the ground of qualities of perfection.
