*Causes for difference in the features and traits of people*

Dhi'lib al-Yamami has related from Ahmad ibn Qutaybah, and he from
'Abdullah ibn Yazid and he from Malik ibn Dihyah who said, \"We were
with Amir al-mu\'minin when discussion arose about the differences of
men (in features and conduct) and then Amir al-mu\'minin said\":

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> روى اليماني، عن أحمد بن قتيبة، عن عبدالله بن يزيد، عن مالك بن دِحْيَةَ،
> قال: كنّا عند أميرالمؤمنين (عليه السلام)، وقد ذكر عنده اختلاف الناس فقل
> ـ :

They differ among themselves because of the sources

of their clay (from which they have been created). This is because they
are either from saltish soil or sweet soil or from rugged earth or soft
earth. They, resemble each other on the basis of the affinity of their
soil and differ according to its difference. Therefore, sometimes a
person of handsome features is weak in intelligence, a tall statured
person is of low courage, a virtuous person is ugly in appearance, a
short statured person is far-sighted, a good-natured person has an evil
trait, a person of perplexed heart has bewildering mind and a
sharp-tongued person has a wakeful heart.

> إِنَّمَا فَرَّقَ بَيْنَهُمْ مَبَادِىءُ طِينِهِمْ، وَذلِكَ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا فِلْقَةً مِنْ سَبَخِ أَرْض وَعَذْبِهَا،
> وَحَزْنِ تُرْبَة وَسَهْلِهَا، فَهُمْ عَلَى حَسَبِ قُرْبِ أَرْضِهِمْ يَتَقَارَبُونَ، وَعَلَى قَدْرِ اخْتِلاَفِهَا
> يَتَفَاوَتُونَ، فَتَامُّ الرُّوَاءِ نَاقِصُ الْعَقْلِ، وَمَادُّ الْقَامَةِ قَصِيرُ الْهِمَّةِ، وَزَاكِي الْعَمَلِ
> قَبِيحُ المَنْظَرِ، وَقَرِيبُ الْقَعْرِ بَعِيدُ السَّبْرِ،مَعْرُوفُ الضَّرِيبَةِ مُنْكَرُ الْجَلِيبَةِ، وَتَائِهُ
> الْقَلْبِ مُتَفَرِّقُ اللُّبِّ، وَطَلِيقُ اللِّسَانِ حدِيدُ الْجَنَانِ.

-  Amir al-mu\'minin
    has ascribed the differences in features and characters of people to
    the differences in the clay from which they are created and
    according to which their features are shaped and the skeletons of
    their characters are formed. Therefore, to the extent that their
    clay of origin is akin, their mental and imaginative tendencies too
    will be similar and to the extent by which they differ, there will
    be a difference in their inclinations and tendencies. By origins of
    a thing are meant those things on which its coming into existence
    depends, but they should not be its cause. The word \"tin\" is the
    plural of \"tinah\" which means origin or basis. Here \"tinah\"
    means semen which after passing through various stages of
    development emerges in the human shape. Its origin means those
    constituents from which those items are created which help in the
    formation of semen. Thus, by saltish, sweet, soft or hard soil the
    reference is to these elementary constituents. Since those
    elementary constituents carry different properties the semen growing
    out of them will also bear different characteristics and
    propensities which will (eventually) show forth in the differences
    in features and conduct of those borne in it.\
    Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid has written (in Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol.
    13, p. 19) that \"origins of tinah\" implies those preservative
    factors which are different in their properties as Plato and other
    philosophers have held. The reason for calling them \"origins of
    tinah\" is that they serve as an asylum for the human body and
    prevent the elements from diffusion. Just as the existence of a
    thing hinges on its basis, in the same way the existence of this
    body which is made up of elements depends on preservative factors.
    So long as the preservative factor exists the body is also safe from
    disruption and disintegration and the elements too are immune to
    diffusion and dispersal. When it leaves the body the elements also
    get dispersed.\
    According to this explanation Amir al-mu\'minin\'s words would mean
    that Allah has created different original factors among whom some
    are vicious and some are virtuous, some are weak and some are
    strong, and every person will act according to his original factor.
    If there is similarity in the inclinations of two persons it is
    because their original factor are similar, and if their tendencies
    differ it is because their original factors do not have any
    similarity. But this conclusion is not correct because Amir
    al-mu\'minin\'s words do not only refer to differences in conduct
    and behaviour but also of features and shape and the differences of
    features and shape cannot be the result of differences in original
    factors.\
    In any case, whether the original factors are the cause of
    differences in features and conduct or the elementary constituents
    are the cause, these words appear to lead to the negation of
    volition and to prove the compulsion (of destiny) in human actions,
    because if man\'s capacity for thinking and acting is dependent on
    \"tinah\" then he would be compelled to behave himself in a fixed
    way on account of which he would neither deserve praise for good
    acts nor be held blame worthy for bad habits. But this hypothesis is
    incorrect because it is well established that just as Allah knows
    everything in creation after its coming into being, in the same way
    He knew it before its creation. Thus, He knew what actions man would
    perform of his free will and what he would leave. Therefore, Allah
    gave him capacity to act according to his free will, and created him
    from a suitable \"tinah\". This tinah is not the cause of his
    actions so as to snatch away from him his free will but the meaning
    of creating from suitable tinah is that Allah does not by force
    stand in man\'s way but allows him to tread the path he wants to
    tread of his own free will.]
