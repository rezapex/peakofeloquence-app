title: Sermon 210
description: 
---

Someone  asked Amir al-mu\'minin about concocted traditions and
contradictory sayings of the Prophet current among the people, whereupon
he said:

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> وقد سأله سائل عن أحاديث البدع، وعما في أيدي الناس من اختلاف الخبر

> فقال (عليه السلام(

Certainly what is current among the people is both right and wrong, true
and false, repealing and repealed, general and particular, definite and
indefinite, exact and surmised. Even during the Prophet\'s days false
sayings had been attributed to him, so much so that he had to say during
his sermon that, \"Whoever attributes falsehoods to me makes his abode
in Hell.\" Those who relate traditions are of four categories,

no more.

> إنَّ فِي أَيْدِي النَّاسِ حَقّاً وَبَاطِلاً، وَصِدْقاً وَكَذِباً، وَنَاسِخاً وَمَنْسُوخاً، وَعَامّاً وَخَاصّاً،
> وَمُحْكَماً وَمُتَشَابِهاً، وَحِفْظاً وَوَهْماً، وَقَدْ كُذِبَ عَلَى رَسُولِ اللهِ(صلى الله عليه وآله
> وسلم) عَلَى عَهْدِهِ، حَتَّى قَامَ خَطِيباً، فَقَالَ: «مَنْ كَذَبَ عَلَيَّ مُتَعَمِّداً فَلْيَتَبَوَّأْ مَقْعَدَهُ
> مِنَ النَّارِ». وَإِنَّمَا أَتَاكَ بِالْحَدِيثِ أَرْبَعَةُ رِجَال لَيْسَ لَهُمْ خَامِسٌ:

## First: The lying hypocrites

> المنافقون

The hypocrite is a person who makes a show of faith and adopts the
appearance of a Muslim; he does not hesitate in sinning nor does he keep
aloof from vice; he wilfully attributes false things against the
Messenger of Allah - may Allah bless him and his descendants. If people
knew that he was a hypocrite and a liar, they would not accept anything
from him and would not confirm what he says.

> رَجُلٌ مُنَافِقٌ مُظْهِرٌ لِلاْيمَانِ، مُتَصَنِّعٌ بِالاْسْلاَمِ، لاَيَتَأَثَّمُ وَلاَ يَتَحَرَّجُ، يَكْذِبُ عَلَى
> رَسُولِ اللهِ (صلى الله عليه وآله) مُتَعَمِّداً، فَلَوْ عَلِمَ النَّاسُ أَنَّهُ مُنَافِقٌ كَاذِبٌ لَمْ
> يَقْبَلُوا مِنْهُ، وَلَمْ يُصَدِّقُوا قَوْلَهُ،

Rather they say that he is the companion of the Prophet, has met him,
heard (his sayings) from him and acquired (knowledge) from him. They
therefore accept what he says. Allah too had warned you well about the
hypocrites and described them fully to you. They have continued after
the Holy Prophet. They gained positions with the leaders of misguidance
and callers towards Hell through falsehoods and slanderings. So, they
put them in high posts and made them officers over the heads of the
people, and amassed wealth through them. People are always with the
rulers and after this world, except those to whom Allah affords
protection. This is the first of the four categories.

> وَلكِنَّهُمْ قَالُوا: صَاحِبُ رَسُولِ اللهِ(صلى الله عليه وآله) رآهُ، وَسَمِعَ مِنْهُ، وَلَقِفَ
> عَنْهُ، فَيَأْخُذُونَ بِقَوْلِهِ، وَقَدْ أَخْبَرَكَ اللهُ عَنِ الْمُنَاقفِقِينَ بِمَا أَخْبَرَكَ، وَوَصَفَهُمْ بِمَا
> وَصَفَهُمْ بِهِ لَكَ، ثُمَّ بَقُوا بَعْدَهُ(عليه السلام)، فَتَقرَّبُوا إِلَى أَئِمَّةِ الضَّلاَلَةِ،
> وَالدُّعَاةِ إِلَى النَّارِ بِالزُّورِ وَالْبُهْتَانِ، فَوَلَّوهُمُ الاْعْمَالَ، وَجَعَلُوهُمْ عَلَى رِقَابِ
> النَّاسِ، وَأَكَلُوا بِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا، وَإِنَّمَا النَّاسُ مَعَ الْمُلُوكِ وَالدُّنْيَا، إِلاَّ مَنْ عَصَمَ
> اللهُ، فَهذَا أَحَدُ الاْرْبَعَةِ.

## Second: Those who are mistaken

> الخاطئون

Then there is the individual who heard (a saying) from the Holy Prophet
but did not memorise it as it was, but surmised it. He does not lie
wilfully. Now, he carries the saying with him and relates it, acts upon
it and claims that: \"I heard it from the Messenger of Allah.\" If the
Muslims come to know that he has committed a mistake in it, they will
not accept it from him, and if he himself knows that he is on the wrong
he will give it up.

> وَرَجُلٌ سَمِعَ مِنْ رَسُولِ اللهِ(صلى الله عليه وآله) شَيْئاً لَمْ يَحْفَظْهُ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ، فَوَهِمَ
> فِيهِ، وَلَمْ يَتَعَمَّدْ كَذِباً، فَهُوَ فِي يَدَيْهِ، يَرْوِيهِ وَيَعْمَلُ بِهِ، وَيَقُولُ: أَنَا سَمِعْتُهُ مِنْ
> رَسُولِ اللهِ(صلى الله عليه وآله)، فَلَوْ عَلِمَ الْمُسْلِمُونَ أَنَّهُ وَهِمَ فِيهِ لَمْ يَقْبَلُوهُ
> مِنْهُ، وَلَوْ عَلِمَ هُوَ أَنَّهُ كَذلِكَ لَرَفَضَهُ .

## Third: Those who are ignorant

> أهل الشبهة

The third man is he who heard the Prophet ordering to do a thing and
later the Prophet refrained the people from doing it, but this man did
not know it, or he heard the Prophet refraining people from a thing and
later he allowed it, but this man did not know it. In this way he
retained in his mind what had been repealed, and did not retain the
repealing tradition. If he knew that it had been repealed he would
reject it, or if the Muslims knew, when they heard it from him, that it
had been repealed they would reject it.

> وَرَجُلٌ ثَالِثٌ، سَمِعَ مِنْ رَسُولِ اللهِ(صلى الله عليه وآله) شَيْئاً يَأْمُرُ بِهِ، ثُمَّ نَهَى
> عَنْهُ وَهُوَ لاَ يَعْلَمُ، أَوْ سَمِعَهُ يَنْهَىُ عَنْ شَيْء، ثُمَّ أَمَرَ بِهِ وَهُوَ لايَعْلَمُ، فَحَفِظَ
> المَنسُوخَ، وَلَمْ يَحْفَظِ النَّاسِخَ، فَلَوْ عَلِمَ أَنَّهُ مَنْسُوخٌ لَرَفَضَهُ، وَلَوْ عَلِمَ الْمُسْلِمُونَ إذْ
> سَمِعُوهُ مِنْهُ أَنَّهُ مَنْسُوخٌ لَرَفَضُوهُ.

## Fourth: Those who memorise truthfully

> الصادقون الحافظون

The last, namely the fourth man, is he who does not speak a lie against
Allah or against His Prophet. He hates falsehood out of fear for Allah
and respect for the Messenger of Allah, and does not commit mistakes,
but retains (in his mind) exactly what he heard (from the Prophet), and
he relates it as he heard it without adding anything or omitting
anything. He heard the repealing tradition, he retained it and acted
upon it, and he heard the repealed tradition and rejected it. He also
understands the particular and the general, and he knows the definite
and indefinite, and gives everything its due position.

> وَآخَرُ رَابِعٌ، لَمْ يَكْذِبْ عَلَى اللهِ، وَلاَ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ، مُبْغِضٌ لِلْكَذِبِ، خَوْفاً لله،
> وَتَعْظيِماً لِرَسُولِ اللهِ، وَلَمْ يَهِمْ، بَلْ حَفظَ مَا سَمِعَ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ، فَجَاءَ بِهِ عَلَى مَا
> سَمِعَهُ، لَمْ يَزِدْ فِيهِ وَلَمْ يَنْقُصْ مِنْهُ، وَحَفِظَ النَّاسِخَ فَعَمِلَ بِهِ، وَحَفِظَ الْمَنْسُوخَ فَجَنَّبَ
> عَنْهُ، وَعَرَفَ الْخَاصَّ وَالْعَامَّ، فَوَضَعَ كُلَّ شَيْء مَوْضِعَهُ، وَعَرفَ المُتَشَابِهَ وَمُحْكَمَهُ .

The sayings of the Prophet used to be of two types. One was particular
and the other common. Sometimes a man would hear him but he would not
know what Allah, the Glorified, meant by it or what the Messenger of
Allah meant by it. In this way the listener carries it and memorises it
without knowing its meaning and its real intention, or what was its
reason.

Among the companions of the Messenger of Allah all were not in the habit
of putting him questions and ask him the meanings, indeed they always
wished that some Bedouin or stranger might come and ask him (peace be
upon him) so that they would also listen. Whenever any such thing came
before me, I asked him about its meaning and preserved it. These are the
reasons and grounds of differences among the people in their traditions.

> وَقَدْ كَانَ يَكُونُ مِنْ رَسُولِ اللهِ (صلى الله عليه وآله) الْكَلاَمُ لَهُ وَجْهَانِ: فَكَلاَمٌ
> خَاصٌّ، وَكَلاَمٌ عَامٌّ، فَيَسْمَعُهُ مَنْ لاَ يَعْرِفُ مَا عَنَى اللهُ بِهِ، وَلاَ مَا عَنَى بِهِ رَسُولُ
> اللهِ (صلى الله عليه وآله) فَيَحْمِلُهُ السَّامِعُ، وَيُوَجِّهُهُ عَلَى غَيْرِ مَعْرِفَة بِمَعْنَاهُ،
> وَمَا قُصِدَ بِهِ، وَمَا خَرَجَ مِنْ أَجْلِهِ، وَلَيْسَ كُلُّ أَصْحَابِ رَسُولِ اللهِ (صلى الله عليه
> وآله) مَنْ كَانَ يَسْأَلُهُ وَيَسْتَفْهِمُهُ، حَتَّى إِنْ كَانُوا لَيُحِبُّونَ أَنْ يَجِيءَ الاْعْرَابِيُّ أَوْ
> الطَّارِىءُ، فَيَسَأَلَهُ (عليه السلام) حَتَّى يَسْمَعُوا، وَكَانَ لاَ يَمُرُّ بِي مِنْ ذلِكَ شَيْءٌ
> إِلاَّ سَأَلْتُ عَنْهُ وَحَفِظْتُهُ. فَهذِهِ وَجُوهُ مَا عَلَيْهِ النَّاسُ فِي اخْتِلاَفِهِمْ، وَعِلَلِهِمْ فِي
> رِوَايَاتِهِمْ.

-  This was Sulaym
    ibn Qays al-Hilali who was one of the relaters of traditions through
    Amir al-mu\'minin.]

-  In this sermon
    Amir al-mu\'minin has divided the traditionists into four
    categories.\
    The first category is that of a man concocts a tradition and
    attributes it to the Prophet. Traditions were in fact falsified and
    attributed to him, and this process continued, with the result that
    numerous novel traditions came into being. This is a fact which
    cannot be denied but if anyone does deny it his basis would be not
    knowledge or sagacity by oratory or argumentative necessity. Thus,
    once, \`Alamu\'l-huda (Ensign of Guidance) as-Sayyid al-Murtada had
    a chance of meeting the Sunni \`ulama\' (scholars) in confrontation
    and on this occasion as-Sayyid al-Murtada proved by historical facts
    that the traditions related about the merits of the great companions
    are concocted and counterfeit. On this, the (Sunni) \`ulama\' argued
    that it was impossible that someone should dare speak a lie against
    the Prophet and prepare a tradition himself and attribute it to him.
    as-Sayyid al-Murtada said there is a tradition of the Prophet that:\
    A lot of false things will be attributed to me after my death and
    whoever speaks a lie against me would be preparing his abode in
    Hell. (al-Bukhari, vol.1, p.38; vol.2, p.102; vol.4, p.207; vol.8,
    p.54; Muslim, vol.8, p.229; Abu Dawud, vol.3, pp.319-320;
    at-Tirmidhi, vol.4, p.524; vol.5, pp.35-36, 40, 199, 634; Ibn Majah,
    vol.1, pp.13-15)\
    If you regard this tradition as true then you should agree that
    false things have been attributed to the Prophet, but if you regard
    it false, this would prove our point. However, these were people
    whose hearts were full of hypocrisy and who used to prepare
    traditions of their own accord in order to create mischief and
    dispersion in religion and to misguide Muslims of weak convictions.
    They remained mixed with them as they used to do during the lifetime
    of the Prophet; and just as they remained busy in activities of
    mischief and destruction in those days, in the same way, even after
    the Prophet, they were not unmindful of deforming the teachings of
    Islam and metamorphosing its features. Rather, in the days of the
    Prophet they were always afraid lest he unveiled them and put them
    to shame, but after the Prophet their hypocritical activities
    increased and they attributed false things to the Prophet without
    demur for their own personal ends, and those who heard them believed
    in them because of their status as companions of the Prophet,
    thinking that whatever they said was correct and whatever they gave
    out was true. Afterwards also, the belief that all the companions
    are correct put a stopper on their tongues, as a result of which
    they were taken to be above criticism, questioning, discussion and
    censure. Besides, their conspicuous performance had made them
    prominent in the eyes of the government, and also because of this it
    needed courage and daring to speak against them. This is proved by
    Amir al-mu\'minin\'s words:\
    These people gained positions with the leaders of misguidance and
    callers towards Hell, through falsehood and slanderings. So, they
    put them in high posts and made them officers over the heads of the
    people.\
    Along with the destruction of Islam, the hypocrites also aimed at
    amassing wealth, and they were doing so freely by claiming to be
    Muslims, because of which they did not want to remove the veil of
    Islam (from their faces) and to come out openly, but they wanted to
    continue their Satanic activities under the garb of Islam and
    engaged themselves in its basic destruction and spreading of
    division and dispersal by concocting traditions. In this connection,
    Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid has written:\
    When they were left free they too left many things. When people
    observed silence about them they also observed silence about Islam,
    but they continued their underground activities such as the
    fabrication of falsehoods to which Amir al-mu\'minin has alluded,
    because a lot of untrue matters had been mixed with the traditions
    by the group of people of wrong beliefs, while some of them also
    aimed at extolling some particular party with whom they had other
    worldly aims as well.\
    On the expiry of this period, when Mu\`awiyah took over the
    leadership of religion and occupied the throne of temporal
    authority, he opened an official department for the fabrication of
    false traditions, and ordered his officers to fabricate and
    popularise traditions in disparagement of the Ahlul Bayt (the
    Household of the Holy Prophet) and in extolment of \`Uthman and the
    Umayyads, and announced rewards and grants of land for this work.
    Consequently, a lot of traditions about self-made distinctions
    gained entry in the books of traditions. Thus, Abu\'l-Hasan
    al-Mada\'ini has written in his book Kitab al-ahdath and Ibn
    Abi\'l-Hadid has quoted it, namely:\
    Mu\`awiyah wrote to his officers that they should take special care
    of those who were adherents of \`Uthman, his well-wishers and lovers
    and to award high positions, precedence and honour to those who
    related traditions about his merits and distinctions, and to convey
    to him whatever is so related by any person, along with his name,
    the name of his father and the name of his tribe. They did
    accordingly and heaped up traditions about the merits and
    distinctions of \`Uthman because Mu\`awiyah used to award them
    rewards, clothes, grants and lands.\
    When the fabricated traditions about the merits of \`Uthman had been
    spread throughout the realm, with the idea that the position of the
    earlier Caliphs should not remain low, Mu\`awiyah wrote to his
    officers:\
    As soon as you receive this order of mine you should call upon the
    people to prepare traditions about the distinctions of the
    companions and other caliphs also, and take care that if any Muslim
    relates any tradition about Abu Turab (\`Ali) you should prepare a
    similar tradition about the companions to contradict it because this
    gives me great pleasure and cools my eyes, and it weakens the
    position of Abu Turab and his partymen. and is more severe to them
    than the merits and distinctions of \`Uthman.\
    When his letters were read to the people, a large number of such
    traditions were related extolling the companions that are all
    fabricated with no truth at all. (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 11,
    pp. 43-47)\
    In this connection Abu \`Abdillah Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn \`Arafah
    known as Niftawayh (244/858-323/935) who was one of the prominent
    scholars and traditionists has written, and Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid has
    quoted him, that:\
    Most of the false traditions about the merits of the companions were
    fabricated during the days of Mu\`awiyah in order to gain position
    in his audience because his view was that in this way he could
    disgrace Banu Hashim and render them low. (ibid.)\
    After that, fabrication of traditions became a habit, the world
    seekers made it a means of securing position with kings and nobles
    and to amass wealth. For example, Ghiyath ibn Ibrahim an-Nakha\`i
    (2nd cent. A.H.) fabricated a tradition about the flight of pigeons,
    in order to please al-Mahdi ibn al-Mansur (the \`Abbasid Caliph) and
    to secure position near him. (Tarikh Baghdad, vol.12, pp.323-327;
    Mizan al-i\`tidal, vol.3) pp.337-338; Lisan al-mizan, vol.4, p.422).
    Abu Sa\`id al-Mada\'ini and others made it a means of livelihood.
    The limit was reached when the al-Karramiyyah and some of the
    al-Mutasawwifah gave the ruling that the fabrication of traditions
    for the prevention of sin or for persuasion towards obedience was
    lawful. Consequently, in connection with persuading and dissuading,
    traditions were fabricated quite freely, and this was not regarded
    against the religious law or morality. Rather, this work was
    generally done by those who bore the appearance of asceticism or
    fear of Allah and who passed their nights in praying and days in
    filling their registers with false traditions. An idea about the
    number of these fabricated traditions can be had from the fact that
    out of six hundred thousand traditions al-Bukhari selected only two
    thousand seven hundred and sixty-one traditions, (Tarikh Baghdad,
    vol.2, p.8; al-Irshad as-sari, vol.1, p.28; Sifatu\'s-safwah, vol.4,
    p.143). Muslim thought fit for selection only four thousand out of
    three hundred thousand (Tarikh Baghdad, vol.13, p.101; al-Muntazam,
    vol.5, p.32; Tabaqat al-huffaz, vol.2, pp.151,157; Wafayat
    al-a\`yan, vol.5, p.194). Abu Dawud took four thousand and eight
    hundred out of five hundred thousand (Tarikh Baghdad, vol.9, p.57;
    Tabaqat al-huffaz, vol.2, p.154; al-Muntazam, vol.5, p.97; Wafayat
    al-a\`yan, vol.2, p.404), and Ahmad ibn Hanbal took thirty thousand
    out of nearly on million traditions (Tarikh Baghdad, vol.4,
    p.419-420; Tabaqat al-huffaz, vol.2, p.17; Wafayat al-a\`yan, vol.1,
    p.64; Tahdhib at-tahdhib, vol.1, p. 74). But when this selection is
    studied some traditions which come across can, in no circumstances,
    be attributed to the Prophet. The result is that a group of
    considerable number has cropped up among Muslims who, in view of
    these (so-called) authoritative collections and true traditions,
    completely reject the evidentiary value of the traditions, (For
    further reference see al-Ghadir, vol.5, pp.
    208-378).]

    The second category of relaters of traditions are those who, without
    appreciating the occasion or context, related whatever they could
    recollect, right or wrong. Thus, in al-Bukhari (vol.2, pp.100-102;
    vol.5, p.98); Muslim (vol.3, pp. 41-45); at-Tirmidhi (vol.3, pp.
    327-329); an-Nasa\'i (vol.4, p.18); Ibn Majah (vol.1, pp.508-509);
    Malik ibn Anas (al-Muwatta\' vol.1, p.234); ash-Shafi\`i
    (Ikhtilaf\'l-hadith, on the side lines of \"al-Umm\", vol.7, p.266);
    Abu Dawud (vol.3, p.194); Ahmad ibn Hanbal (vol.1, pp.41,42) and
    al-Bayhaqi (vol.4, pp.72-74) in the chapter entitled \'weeping over
    the dead\' it is stated that when Caliph \`Umar was wounded Suhayb
    came weeping to him, then \`Umar said:\
    O\' Suhayb, you weep over me, while the Prophet had said that the
    dead person is punished if his people weep over him.

    When after the death of Caliph \`Umar this was mentioned to
    \`A\'ishah, she said: \"May Allah have mercy on \`Umar. The
    Messenger of Allah did not say that weeping of relations causes
    punishment on the dead. but he said that the punishment of an
    unbeliever increases if his people weep over him.\" After this
    \`A\'ishah said that according to the Holy Qur\'an no person has to
    bear the burden of another, so how could the burden of those who
    weep be put on the dead. After this the following verse was quoted
    by \`A\'ishah:\
    . . . And no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another;
    (Qur\'an, 6:164; 17:15; 35:18; 39:7; 53:38).\
    The wife of the Holy Prophet \`A\'ishah relates that once the
    Prophet passed by a Jewish woman over whom her people were weeping.
    The Prophet then remarked, \"Her people are weeping over her but she
    is undergoing punishment in the grave.\"

    The third category of the relaters of traditions is of those who
    heard some repealed traditions from the Prophet but could not get
    any chance to hear the repealing traditions which he could relate to
    others. An example of a repealing tradition is the saying of the
    Prophet which also contains a reference to the repealed tradition,
    namely: \"I had disallowed you to visit graves, but now you can
    visit them.\" (Muslim, vol.3, p.65; at-Tirmidhi, vol.3, p.370; Abu
    Dawud, vol.3, pp. 218, 332; an-Nasa\'i, vol.4, p. 89; Ibn Majah,
    vol.1, pp. 500-501; Malik ibn Anas, vol.2, p. 485; Ahmad ibn Hanbal,
    vol.1, pp.145, 452; vol.3, pp.38, 63, 66, 237, 350; vol.5, pp. 350,
    355, 356, 357, 359, 361; al-Hakim, al-Mustadrak, vol.1, pp. 374-376;
    and al-Bayhaqi, vol.4, pp. 76-77). Herein the permission to visit
    graves has repealed the previous restriction on it. Now, those who
    heard only the repealed tradition continued acting according to it.

    The fourth category of relaters of traditions is of those who were
    fully aware of the principles of justice, possessed intelligence and
    sagacity, knew the occasion when a tradition was first uttered (by
    the Prophet) and were also acquainted with the repealing and the
    repealed traditions, the particular and the general, and the timely
    and the absolute. They avoided falsehood and fabrication. Whatever
    they heard remained preserved in their memory, and they conveyed it
    with exactness to others. It is they whose traditions are the
    precious possession of Islam, free from fraud and counterfeit and
    worthy of being trusted and acted upon. That collection of
    traditions which has been conveyed through trustworthy bosoms like
    that of Amir al-mu\'minin and has remained free from cutting,
    curtailing, alteration or change particularly present Islam in its
    true form. The position of Amir al-mu\'minin in Islamic knowledge
    has been most certainly proved through the following traditions
    narrated from the Holy Prophet such as:\
    Amir al-mu\'minin, Jabir ibn \`Abdullah, Ibn \`Abbas and \`Abdullah
    ibn \`Umar have narrated from the Holy Prophet that he said:\
    I am the city of knowledge and \`Ali is its door. He who wants to
    acquire (my) knowledge should come through its door. (al-Mustadrak,
    vol.3, pp. 126-127; al-Isti\`ab, vol.3, p.1102; Usd al-ghabah,
    vol.4, p.22; Tarikh Baghdad, vol.2, p.377; vol.4, p.348; vol.7,

    Amir al-mu\'minin and Ibn \`Abbas have also narrated from the Holy
    Prophet that:\
    I am the store-house of wisdom and \`Ali is its door. He who wants
    to acquire wisdom should come through its door. (Hilyah al-awliya\',
    vol.1, p.64; Masabih as-sunnah, vol.2, p.275; Tarikh Baghdad,

    If only people could take the Prophet\'s blessings through these
    sources of knowledge. But it is a tragic chapter of history that
    although traditions are accepted through the Kharijites and enemies
    of the Prophet\'s family, whenever the series of relaters includes
    the name of any individual from among the Prophet\'s family there is
    hesitation in accepting the tradition.
