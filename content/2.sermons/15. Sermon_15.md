title: Sermon 15
description:

After returning to the Muslims the land grants made by 'Uthman ibn
'Affan, he said:

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> فيما ردّه على المسلمين من قطائع عثمان

By Allah, even if I had found that by such money women have been married
or slave-maids have been purchased I would have returned it (to its
owners) because there is wide scope in dispensation of justice, and he
who finds it hard to act justly will find it harder to deal with
injustice.

> وَاللهِ لَوْ وَجَدْتُهُ قَدْ تُزُوِّجَ بِهِ النِّسَاءُ، وَمُلِكَ بِهِ الاْمَاءُ، لَرَدَدْتُهُ; فَإِنَّ في العَدْلِ
> سَعَةً، وَمَنْ ضَاقَ عَلَيْهِ العَدْلُ، فَالجَوْرُ عَلَيْهِ أَضيَقُ!
