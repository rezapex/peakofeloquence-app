*Amir al-mu\'minin said about Marwan ibn al-Hakam at Basrah. When Marwan
was taken on the day of Jamal, he asked Hasan and Husayn (p.b.u.t.) to
intercede on his behalf before Amir al-mu\'minin. So they spoke to Amir
al-mu\'minin about him and he released him. Then they said, \"O\' Amir
al-mu\'minin he desires to swear you allegiance\" Whereupon Amir
al-mu\'minin said:*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> قاله لمروان بن الحكم بالبصرة

> قالوا: أُخِذَ مروان بن الحكم أَسيراً يوم الجمل، فاستشفع الحسن والحسين
> (عليهما السلام) إلى أَميرالمؤمنين (عليه السلام)، فكلّماه فيه، فخلّى
> سبيله، فقالا له: يبايعك يا أميرالمؤمنين؟ فقال:

Did he not swear me allegiance after the killing of 'Uthman? Now I do
not need his allegiance, because his is the hand of a Jew. If he swears
me allegiance with his hand he would violate it after a short while.
Well, he is to get power for so long as a dog licks his nose. He is the
father of four rams (who will also rule). The people will face days
through him and his sons.

> أَفَلَمْ يُبَايِعْنِي بَعْدَ قَتْلِ عُثْمانَ؟ لاَ حَاجَةَ لِي في بَيْعَتِهِ! إِنِّهَا كَفٌّ يَهُودِيَّةٌ لَوْ
> بَايَعَنِي بِيَدِهِ لَغَدَرَ بِسُبَّتِهِ. أَمَا إِنَّ لَهُ إِمْرَةً كَلَعْقَةِ الْكَلْبِ أَنْفَهُ، وَهُوَ أَبُو
> الاْكُبُشِ الاْرْبَعَةِ، وَسَتَلْقَى الاْمَّة مِنْهُ وَمِنْ وَلَدِهِ يَوْمَاً أَحْمَرَ!

-  Marwan ibn
    al-Hakam was the nephew (brother\'s son) and son-in-law of \`Uthman.
    Due to thin body and tall stature he was known with the nickname
    \"Khayt Batil\" (the thread of wrong). When \`Abd al-Malik ibn
    Marwan killed \`Amr ibn Sa\`id al-Ashdaq, his brother Yahya ibn
    Sa\`id said:\
    O\' sons of Khayt Batil (the thread of the wrong) you have played
    deceit on \`Amr and people like you build their houses (of
    authority) on deceit and treachery.\
    Although his father al-Hakam ibn Abi al-\`As had accepted Islam at
    the time of the fall of Mecca but his behaviour and activities were
    very painful to the Prophet. Consequently, the Prophet cursed him
    and his descendants and said, \"Woe will befall my people from the
    progeny of this man.\" At last in view of his increasing intrigues
    the Prophet externed him from Medina towards the valley of Wajj (in
    Ta\'if) and Marwan also went with him. Prophet did not thereafter
    allow them entry in Medina all his life. Abu Bakr and \`Umar did
    likewise, but \`Uthman sent for both of them during his reign, and
    raised Marwan to such height as though the reins of caliphate rested
    in his hands. Thereafter his circumstances became so favourable that
    on the death of Mu\`awiyah ibn Yazid he became the Caliph of the
    Muslims. But he had just ruled only for nine months and eighteen
    days that death overtook him in such a way that his wife sat with
    the pillow on his face and did not get away till he breathed his
    last.\
    The four sons to whom Amir al-mu\'minin has referred were the four
    sons of \`Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan namely al-Walid, Sulayman, Yazid
    and Hisham, who ascended the Caliphate one after the other and
    coloured the pages of history with their stories. Some commentators
    have regarded this reference to Marwan\'s own sons whose names are
    \`Abd al-Malik, \`Abd al-\`Aziz, Bishr and Muhammad. Out of these
    \`Abd al-Malik did become Caliph of Islam but \`Abd al-\`Aziz became
    governor of Egypt, Bishr of Iraq and Muhammad of
    al-Jazirah.]
