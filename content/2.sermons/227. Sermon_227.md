*About a companion who passed away from this world before the occurrence
of troubles.*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> يريد به بعض أصحابه

May Allah reward such and such man

who straightened the curve, cured the disease, abandoned mischief and
established the *sunnah*. He departed (from this world) with untarnished
clothes and little shortcomings. He achieved good (of this world) and
remained safe from its evils. He offered Allah\'s obedience and feared
Him as He deserved. He went away and left the people in dividing ways
wherein the misled cannot obtain guidance and the guided cannot attain
certainty.

> لله بلادُ فُلاَن، فَلَقَدْ قَوَّمَ الاْوَدَ، وَدَاوَى الْعَمَدَ، وَأَقَامَ السُّنَّةَ، وَخَلَّفَ الْفِتْنَةَ!
> ذَهَبَ نَقِيَّ الثَّوْبِ، قَلِيلَ الْعَيْبِ، أَصَابَ خَيْرَهَا، وَسَبَقَ شَرَّهَا، أَدَّى إِلَى اللهِ طَاعَتَهُ،
> وَاتَّقَاهُ بِحَقِّهِ، رَحَلَ وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِي طُرُق مَتَشَعِّبَة، لاَ يَهْتَدِي بِهَا الضَّالُّ، وَلاَ يَسْتَيْقِنُ
> الْمُهْتَدِي.

-  Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid
    has written (in Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 14, pp. 3-4) that the
    reference here is to the second Caliph \`Umar, and that these
    sentences have been uttered in his praise as indicated by the word
    \'\`Umar\' written under the word \'such and such\' in as-Sayyid
    ar-Radi\'s own hand in the manuscript of Nahjul Balaghah written by
    him. This is Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid\'s statement, but it is to be seen
    that if as-Sayyid ar-Radi had written the word \'\`Umar\' by way of
    explanation it should have existed, as other explanations by him
    have remained, in those versions which have been copied from his
    manuscript. Even now there exists in al-Musil (Iraq) university the
    oldest copy of Nahjul Balaghah written by the famous calligraphist
    Yaqut al-Musta\`simi; but no one has afforded any clue to this
    explanation of as-Sayyid ar-Radi. Even if the view of Ibn
    Abi\'l-Hadid is accepted it would be deemed to represent the
    personal opinion of as-Sayyid ar-Radi which may serve as a
    supplementary argument in support of an original argument but this
    personal view cannot be assigned any regular importance.\
    It is strange that two and a half centuries after as-Sayyid ar-Radi
    namely in the seventh century A.H., Ibn Abi\'l Hadid makes the
    statement that the reference here is to Caliph \`Umar and that
    as-Sayyid ar-Radi himself had so indicated, as a result of which
    some other annotators also followed the same line, but the
    contemporaries of as-Sayyid ar-Radi who wrote about Nahjul Balaghah
    have given no such indication in their writings although as
    contemporaries they should have had better information about
    as-Sayyid Ar-Radi\'s writing. Thus, al-\`Allamah \`Ali ibn Nasir who
    was a contemporary of as-Sayyid ar-Radi and wrote an annotation of
    Nahjul Balaghah under the name of A\`lam Nahjul Balaghah writes in
    connection with this sermon:\
    Amir al-mu\'minin has praised one of his own companions for his good
    conduct. He had died before the troubles that arose after the death
    of the Prophet of Allah.\
    This is supported by the annotations of Nahjul Balaghah written by
    al-\`Allamah Qutbu\'d-Din ar-Rawandi (d. 573 A.H.). Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid
    (vol. 14, p. 4) and Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani (in Sharh Nahjul
    Balaghah, vol. 4, p. 97) have quoted his following view.\
    By this Amir al-mu\'minin refers to one of his own companions who
    died before the mischief and disruption that occurred following the
    death of the Prophet of Allah.\
    Al-\`Allamah al-Hajj al-Mirza Habibu\'llah al-Khu\'i is of the
    opinion that the person is Malik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar on the
    ground that after the assassination of Malik the situation of the
    Muslim community was such as Amir al-mu\'minin explains in this
    sermon.\
    al-Khu\'i adds that:\
    Amir al-mu\'minin has praised Malik repeatedly such as in his letter
    to the people of Egypt sent through Malik when he was made the
    governor of that place, and like his utterances when the news of
    Malik\'s assassination reached him, he said: \"Malik! who is Malik?
    If Malik was a stone, he was hard and solid; if he was a rock, he
    was a great rock which had no parallel. Women have become barren to
    give birth to such as Malik.\" Amir al-mu\'minin had even expressed
    in some of his utterances that, \"Malik was to me as I was to the
    Holy Prophet.\" Therefore, one who possesses such a position
    certainly deserves such attributes and even beyond that. (Sharh
    Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 14, pp. 374-375)\
    If these words had been about Caliph \`Umar and there was some
    trustworthiness about it Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid would have recorded the
    authority or tradition and it would have existed in history and been
    known among the people. But here nothing is found to prove the
    statement except a few self-concocted events. Thus about the
    pronouns in the words \"khayraha\" and \"sharraha\" he takes them to
    refer to the caliphate and writes that these words can apply only to
    one who enjoys power and authority because without authority it is
    impossible to establish the sunnah or prevent innovation. This is
    the gist of the argument he has advanced on this occasion; although
    there is no proof to establish that the antecedent of this pronoun
    is the caliphate. It can rather refer to the world (when Amir
    al-mu\'minin says, \"He achieved good \[of this world\] and remained
    safe from its evils.\") and that would be in accord with the
    context. Again, to regard authority as a condition for the
    safeguarding of people\'s interest and the propagation of the sunnah
    means to close the door to prompting others to good and dissuading
    them from evil, although Allah has assigned this duty to a group of
    the people without the condition of authority:\
    And that there should be among you a group who call (mankind) unto
    virtue and enjoin what is good and forbid wrong; and these are they
    who shall be successful. (Qur\'an, 3:104)\
    Similarly it is related from the Prophet:\
    So long as people go on prompting for good and dissuading from evil
    and assisting each other in virtue and piety they will remain in
    righteousness.\
    Again, Amir al-mu\'minin, in the course of a will, says in general
    terms: Establish the pillars of the Unity of Allah and the sunnah,
    and keep both these lamps aflame.\
    In these sayings there is no hint that this obligation cannot be
    discharged without authority. Facts also tell us that (despite army
    and force, and power and authority) the rulers and kings could not
    prevent evil or propagate virtue to the extent to which some unknown
    godly persons were able to inculcate moral values by imprinting
    their morality on heart and minds, although they were not backed by
    any army or force and they didn\'t have any equipment save
    destitution. No doubt authority and control can bend heads down
    before it, but it is not necessary that it should also pave the way
    for virtue in hearts. History shows that most of the rulers
    destroyed the features of Islam. Islam\'s existence and progress has
    been possible by the efforts of those helpless persons who possessed
    nothing save poverty and discomfiture.\
    If it is insisted that the reference here should only be to a ruler,
    then why should it not be taken to mean a companion of Amir
    al-mu\'minin who had been the head of a Province such as Salman
    al-Farisi for whose burial Amir al-mu\'minin went to al-Mada\'in;
    and it is not implausible that Amir al-mu\'minin might have uttered
    these words after his burial by way of comments on his life and way
    of governance. However, to believe that they are about Caliph \`Umar
    is without any proof. In the end, Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid has quoted the
    following statements of (the historian) at-Tabari in proof of his
    hypothesis:\
    \"It is related from al-Mughirah ibn Shu\`bah that when Caliph
    \`Umar died Ibnah Abi Hathmah said crying. \"Oh \`Umar, you were the
    man who straightened the curve, removed ills, destroyed mischief,
    revived the sunnah, remained chaste and departed without entangling
    in evils.\' (According to at-Tabari) al-Mughirah related that \"When
    \`Umar was buried I came to \`Ali and I wanted to hear something
    from him about \`Umar. So, on my arrival Amir al-mu\'minin came out
    in this state that was wrapped in one cloth after bathing and was
    jerking the hair of his head and beard and he had no doubt that the
    Caliphate would come to him. On this occasion he said, \"May Allah
    have mercy on \`Umar.\" Ibnah Abi Hathmah has correctly said that he
    enjoyed the good of the Caliphate and remained safe from its evils.
    By Allah, she did not say it herself but was made to say so.\"
    (at-Tabari, vol. 1, p. 2763; Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid, vol. 12, p. 5; Ibn
    Kathir, vol. 7, p. 140)\
    The relater of this event is al-Mughirah ibn Shu\`bah whose adultery
    with Umm Jamil, the Caliph \`Umar\'s saving him from the penalty
    despite the evidence, and his openly abusing Amir al-mu\'minin in
    Kufah under Mu\`awiyah\'s behest are admitted facts of history. On
    this ground what weight his statements can carry is quite clear.
    From the factual point of view also, this story cannot be accepted.
    Al-Mughirah\'s statement that Amir al-mu\'minin had no doubt about
    his Caliphate is against the facts. What were the factors from which
    he made this guess when the actual facts were to the contrary. If
    the caliphate was certain for any one, it was \`Uthman. Thus, at the
    Consultative Committee \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn \`Awf said to Amir
    al-mu\'minin: \"O\' \`Ali! do not create a situation against
    yourself for I have observed and consulted the people and they all
    want \`Uthman.\" (at-Tabari, vol. 1, p. 2786; Ibn al-Athir, vol.
    3, p. 71; Abu\'l-Fida\', vol. 1, p. 166)\
    Consequently, Amir al-mu\'minin was sure not to get the caliphate as
    has already been stated on the authority of at-Tabari\'s History,
    under the sermon of the Camel\'s Foam (ash-Shiqshiqiyyah), namely
    that on seeing the names of the members of the Consultative
    Committee, Amir al-mu\'minin had said to al-\`Abbas ibn \`Abd
    al-Muttalib that the caliphate could not be given to anyone except
    \`Uthman since all the powers had been given to \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn
    \`Awf and he was \`Uthman\'s brother-in-law (sister\'s husband) and
    Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas was a relative and tribesman of \`Abd
    ar-Rahman. These two would join in giving the caliphate to him.\
    At this stage, the question arises as to what the reason was that
    actuated al-Mughirah to prompt Amir al-mu\'minin to say something
    about \`Umar. If he knew that Amir al-mu\'minin had good ideas about
    \`Umar, he should have also known his impression; but if he thought
    that Amir al-mu\'minin did not entertain good ideas about him then
    the purpose of his asking Amir al-mu\'minin would be none other than
    that whatever he may say he would, by exposing it, create an
    atmosphere against him and make the members of the Consultative
    Committee suspicious of him. The views of the members of the
    Consultative Committee are well understood from the very fact that
    by putting the condition of following the conduct of the first two
    Caliphs in electing the caliph they had shown their adherence to
    them. In these circumstances when al-Mughirah tried to play this
    trick Amir al-mu\'minin said just by way of relating a fact that
    \`Umar achieved the good (of this world) and remained safe from its
    evil. This sentence has no connection with praise or eulogy. \`Umar
    did in his days enjoy all kinds of advantages while his period was
    free from the mischiefs that cropped up later. After recording this
    statement Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid writes:\
    From this event the belief gains strength that in this utterance the
    allusion is towards \`Umar.\
    If the utterance means the word uttered by Ibnah Abi Hathmah about
    which Amir al-mu\'minin has said that they are not her own heart\'s
    voice but she was made to utter them, then doubtlessly the reference
    is to \`Umar, but the view that these words were uttered by Amir
    al-mu\'minin in praise of \`Umar is not at all established. Rather,
    from this tradition it is evidently shown that these words were
    uttered by Ibnah Abi Hathmah. Allah alone knows on what ground the
    words of Ibnah Abi Hathmah are quoted and then it is daringly argued
    that these words were uttered by Amir al-mu\'minin about \`Umar. It
    seems Amir al-mu\'minin had uttered these words about someone on
    some occasion, then Ibnah Abi Hathmah used similar words on
    \`Umar\'s death and then even Amir al-mu\'minin\'s words were taken
    to be in praise of \`Umar. Otherwise, no mind except a mad one can
    argue that the words uttered by Ibnah Abi Hathmah should be deemed a
    ground to hold that Amir al-mu\'minin said these words in praise of
    \`Umar. Can it be expected, after (a glance at) the sermon of the
    Camel\'s Foam, that Amir al-mu\'minin might have uttered these
    words. Again, it is worth consideration that if these words had been
    uttered by Amir al-mu\'minin on \`Umar\'s death, then at the
    Consultative Committee when he refused to follow the conduct of the
    (first) two Caliphs it should have been said to him that only the
    other day he has said that \`Umar had established the sunnah and
    banished innovations, so that when his conduct was in accord with
    the sunnah what was the sense in accepting the sunnah but refusing
    to follow his conduct.]
