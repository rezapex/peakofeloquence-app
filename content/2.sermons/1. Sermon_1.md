> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام) يذكر فيها ابتداءَ خلق السماءِ والاَرض، وخلق آدم
> عليه الصلاة والسلام
> (فيها ذكر الحج)
> (وتحتوي على حمد الله، وخلق العالم، وخلق الملائكة، واختيار الانبياء،
> ومبعث النبي، والقرآن، والاحكام الشرعية)

Praise is due to Allah whose worth cannot be described by speakers,
whose bounties cannot be counted by calculators and whose claim (to
obedience) cannot be satisfied by those who attempt to do so, whom the
height of intellectual courage cannot appreciate, and the divings of
understanding cannot reach; He for whose description no limit has been
laid down, no eulogy exists, no time is ordained and no duration is
fixed. He brought forth creation through His Omnipotence, dispersed
winds through His Compassion, and made firm the shaking earth with
rocks.

> الحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذَي لاَ يَبْلُغُ مِدْحَتَهُ القَائِلُونَ، وَلاِ يُحْصِي نَعْمَاءَهُ العَادُّونَ، ولاَ
> يُؤَدِّي حَقَّهُ الُمجْتَهِدُونَ، الَّذِي لاَ يُدْركُهُ بُعْدُ الهِمَمِ، وَلاَ يَنَالُهُ غَوْصُ الفِطَنِ، الَّذِي
> لَيْسَ لِصِفَتِهِ حَدٌّ مَحْدُودٌ، وَلاَ نَعْتٌ مَوْجُودٌ، وَلا وَقْتٌ مَعْدُودٌ، وَلا أَجَلٌ مَمْدُودٌ. فَطَرَ
> الخَلائِقَ بِقُدْرَتِهَ، وَنَشَرَ الرِّيَاحَ بِرَحْمَتِهِ، وَوَتَّدَ بِالصُّخُورِ مَيَدَانَ أَرْضِهِ.

The foremost in religion is the acknowledgement of Him, the perfection
of acknowledging Him is to testify Him, the perfection of testifying Him
is to believe in His Oneness, the perfection of believing in His Oneness
is to regard Him Pure, and the perfection of His purity is to deny Him
attributes, because every attribute is a proof that it is different from
that to which it is attributed and everything to which something is
attributed is different from the attribute.

Thus whoever attaches attributes to Allah recognises His like, and
whoever recognises His like regards Him two; and whoever regards Him as
two recognises parts for Him; and whoever recognises parts for Him
mistook Him; and whoever mistook Him pointed at Him; and whoever pointed
at Him admitted limitations for Him; and whoever admitted limitations
for Him numbered Him. Whoever said: 'In what is He?', held that He is
contained; and whoever said: 'On what is He?', held He is not on
something else.

> أَوَّلُ الدِّينِ مَعْرِفَتُهُ، وَكَمَالُ مَعْرِفَتِهِ التَّصْديقُ بِهِ، وَكَمَالُ التَّصْدِيقِ بِهِ تَوْحِيدُهُ،
> وَكَمَالُ تَوْحِيدِهِ الاخْلاصُ لَهُ، وَكَمَالُ الاخْلاصِ لَهُ نَفْيُ الصِّفَاتِ عَنْهُ، لِشَهَادَةِ كُلِّ
> صِفَة أَنَّها غَيْرُ المَوْصُوفِ، وَشَهَادَةِ كُلِّ مَوْصُوف أَنَّهُ غَيْرُ الصِّفَةِ، فَمَنْ وَصَفَ اللهَ
> سُبْحَانَهُ فَقَدْ قَرَنَهُ، وَمَنْ قَرَنَهُ فَقَدْ ثَنَّاهُ،وَمَنْ ثَنَّاهُ فَقَد جَزَّأَهُ، وَمَنْ جَزَّأَهُ فَقَدْ
> جَهِلَهُ، وَمَنْ جَهِلَهُ فَقَدْ أشَارَ إِلَيْهِ، وَمَنْ أشَارَ إِلَيْهِ فَقَدْ حَدَّهُ، وَمَنْ حَدَّهُ فَقَدْ عَدَّهُ،
> وَمَنْ قَالَ: «فِيمَ» فَقَدْ ضَمَّنَهُ، وَمَنْ قَالَ: «عَلاَمَ؟» فَقَدْ أَخْلَى مِنُهُ.

He is a Being, but not through phenomenon of coming into being. He
exists but not from non-existence. He is with everything but not in
physical nearness. He is different from everything but not in physical
separation. He acts but without connotation of movements and
instruments. He sees even when there is none to be looked at from among
His creation. He is only One, such that there is none with whom He may
keep company or whom He may miss in his absence.

> كائِنٌ لاَ عَنْ حَدَث، مَوْجُودٌ لاَ عَنْ عَدَم، مَعَ كُلِّ شَيْء لاَ بِمُقَارَنَة، وَغَيْرُ كُلِّ شيء لا
> بِمُزَايَلَة، فَاعِلٌ لا بِمَعْنَى الْحَرَكَاتِ وَالاْلةِ، بَصِيرٌ إذْ لاَ مَنْظُورَ إلَيْهِ مِنْ خَلْقِهِ،
> مُتَوَحِّدٌ إذْ لاَ سَكَنَ يَسْتَأْنِسُ بهِ وَلاَ يَسْتوْحِشُ لِفَقْدِهِ.

## The Creation of the Universe

> خلق العالم

He initiated creation most initially and commenced it originally,
without undergoing reflection, without making use of any experiment,
without innovating any movement, and without experiencing any aspiration
of mind. He allotted all things their times, put together their
variations gave them their properties, and determined their features
knowing them before creating them, realising fully their limits and
confines and appreciating their propensities and intricacies.

> أَنْشَأَ الخَلْقَ إنْشَاءً، وَابْتَدَأَهُ ابْتِدَاءً، بِلاَ رَوِيَّة أَجَالَهَا، وَلاَ تَجْرِبَة اسْتَفَادَهَا،
> وَلاَ حَرَكَة أَحْدَثَهَا، وَلاَ هَمَامَةِ نَفْس اضطَرَبَ فِيهَا. أَحَالَ الاْشياءَ لاِوْقَاتِهَا، وَلاَمَ
> بَيْنَ مُخْتَلِفَاتِهَا، وَغَرَّزَ غَرائِزَهَا، وَأَلزَمَهَا أشْبَاحَهَا، عَالِماً بِهَا قَبْلَ ابْتِدَائِهَا،
> مُحِيطاً بِحُدُودِها وَانْتِهَائِهَا، عَارفاً بِقَرَائِنِها وَأَحْنَائِهَا.

When Almighty created the openings of atmosphere, expanse of firmament
and strata of winds, He flowed into it water whose waves were stormy and
whose surges leapt one over the other. He loaded it on dashing wind and
breaking typhoons, ordered them to shed it back (as rain), gave the wind
control over the vigour of the rain, and acquainted it with its
limitations. The wind blew under it while water flowed furiously over
it.

> ثُمَّ أَنْشَأَ ـ سُبْحَانَهُ ـ فَتْقَ الاْجْوَاءِ، وَشَقَّ الاْرْجَاءِ، وَسَكَائِكَ الَهوَاءِ، فأَجازَ فِيهَا
> مَاءً مُتَلاطِماً تَيَّارُهُ، مُتَراكِماً زَخَّارُهُ، حَمَلَهُ عَلَى مَتْنِ . الرِّيحِ الْعَاصِفَةِ،
> وَالزَّعْزَعِ الْقَاصِفَةِ، فَأَمَرَها بِرَدِّهِ، وَسَلَّطَهَا عَلَى شَدِّهِ، وَقَرنَهَا إِلَى حَدِّهِ، الهَوَاءُ
> مِنْ تَحْتِها فَتِيقٌ، وَالمَاءُ مِنْ فَوْقِهَا دَفِيقٌ.

Then Almighty created forth wind and made its movement sterile,
perpetuated its position, intensified its motion and spread it far and
wide. Then He ordered the wind to raise up deep waters and to intensify
the waves of the oceans. So the wind churned it like the churning of
curd and pushed it fiercely into the firmament throwing its front
position on the rear and the stationary on the flowing till its level
was raised and the surface was full of foam.

Then Almighty raised the foam on to the open wind and vast firmament and
made there-from the seven skies and made the lower one as a stationary
surge and the upper one as protective ceiling and a high edifice without
any pole to support it or nail to hold it together.

Then He decorated them with stars and the light of meteors and hung in
it the shining sun and effulgent moon under the revolving sky, moving
ceiling and rotating firmament.

> ثُمَّ أَنْشَأَ سُبْحَانَهُ رِيحاً اعْتَقَمَ مَهَبَّهَا، وَأَدَامَ مُرَبَّهَا، وَأَعْصَفَ مَجْرَاها، وَأَبْعَدَ
> مَنْشَاهَا، فَأَمَرَها بِتَصْفِيقِ المَاءِ الزَّخَّارِ، وَإِثَارَةِ مَوْجِ البِحَارِ، فَمَخَضَتْهُ مَخْضَ
> السِّقَاءِ، وَعَصَفَتْ بهِ عَصْفَهَا بِالفَضَاءِ، تَرُدُّ أَوَّلَهُ عَلَى آخِرِهِ، وَسَاجِيَهُ عَلَى مَائِرِهِ،
> حَتَّى عَبَّ عُبَابُهُ، وَرَمَى بِالزَّبَدِ رُكَامُهُ، فَرَفَعَهُ فِي هَوَاء مُنْفَتِق، وَجَوٍّ مُنْفَهِق، فَسَوَّى
> مِنْهُ سَبْعَ سَموَات، جَعَلَ سُفْلاَهُنَّ مَوْجاً مَكْفُوفاً، وَعُلْيَاهُنَّ سَقْفاً مَحْفُوظاً، وَسَمْكاً
> مَرْفُوعاً، بِغَيْر عَمَد يَدْعَمُهَا، وَلا دِسَار يَنْظِمُها.

> ثُمَّ زَيَّنَهَا بِزينَةِ الكَوَاكِبِ، وَضِياءِ الثَّوَاقِبِ، وَأَجْرَى فِيها سِرَاجاً مُسْتَطِيراً، وَقَمَراً
> مُنِيراً: في فَلَك دَائِر، وَسَقْف سَائِر، وَرَقِيم مَائِر.

## The Creation of the Angels

> خلق الملائكة

Then He created the openings between high skies and filled them with all
classes of His angels. Some of them are in prostration and do not kneel
up. Others in kneeling position and do not stand up. Some of them are in
array and do not leave their position. Others are extolling Allah and do
not get tired. The sleep of the eye or the slip of wit, or languor of
the body or the effect of forgetfulness does not effect them.

Among them are those who work as trusted bearers of His message, those
who serve as speaking tongues for His prophets and those who carry to
and fro His orders and injunctions. Among them are the protectors of His
creatures and guards of the doors of the gardens of Paradise.

Among them are those also whose steps are fixed on earth but their necks
are protruding into the skies, their limbs are getting out on all sides,
their shoulders are in accord with the columns of the Divine Throne,
their eyes are downcast before it, they have spread down their wings
under it and they have rendered between themselves and all else curtains
of honour and screens of power.

They do not think of their Creator through image, do not impute to Him
attributes of the created, do not confine Him within abodes and do not
point at Him through illustrations.

> ثُمَّ فَتَقَ مَا بَيْنَ السَّمواتِ العُلاَ، فَمَلاَهُنَّ أَطْواراً مِنْ مَلائِكَتِهِ:
> مِنْهُمْ سُجُودٌ لاَيَرْكَعُونَ، وَرُكُوعٌ لاَ يَنْتَصِبُونَ، وَصَافُّونَ لاَ يَتَزَايَلُونَ، وَمُسَبِّحُونَ لاَ
> يَسْأَمُونَ، لاَ يَغْشَاهُمْ نَوْمُ العُيُونِ، وَلاَ سَهْوُ العُقُولِ، وَلاَ فَتْرَةُ الاَبْدَانِ، ولاَ

> وَمِنْهُمُ الحَفَظَةُ لِعِبَادِهِ، وَالسَّدَنَةُ لاِبْوَابِ جِنَانِهِ.
> وَمِنْهُمُ الثَّابِتَةُ في الاْرَضِينَ السُّفْلَى أَقْدَامُهُمْ، وَالمَارِقَةُ مِنَ السَّماءِ العُلْيَا
> أَعْنَاقُهُمْ، والخَارجَةُ مِنَ الاْقْطَارِ أَرْكَانُهُمْ، وَالمُنَاسِبَةُ لِقَوَائِمِ العَرْشِ أَكْتَافُهُمْ،
> نَاكِسَةٌ دُونَهُ أَبْصارُهُمْ، مُتَلَفِّعُونَ تَحْتَهُ بِأَجْنِحَتِهِمْ، مَضْرُوبَةٌ بَيْنَهُمْ وَبَيْنَ مِنْ دُونَهُمْ
> حُجُبُ العِزَّةِ، وَأسْتَارُ القُدْرَةِ، لاَ يَتَوَهَّمُونَ رَبَّهُمْ بالتَّصْوِيرِ، وَلاَ يُجْرُونَ عَلَيْهِ

## Description of the Creation of Adam

> منها: في صفة خلق آدم (عليه السلام)

Allah collected from hard, soft, sweet and sour earth, clay which He
dripped in water till it got pure, and kneaded it with moisture till it
became gluey. From it He carved an image with curves, joints, limbs and
segments. He solidified it till it dried up for a fixed time and a known
duration. Then He blew into it out of His Spirit whereupon it took the
pattern of a human being with mind that governs him, intelligence which
he makes use of, limbs that serve him, organs that change his position,
sagacity that differentiates between truth and untruth, tastes and
smells, colours and species. He is a mixture of clays of different
colours, cohesive materials, divergent contradictories and differing
properties like heat, cold, softness and hardness, grief and joy.

> ثُمَّ جَمَعَ سُبْحَانَهُ مِنْ حَزْنِ الاْرْضِ وَسَهْلِهَا، وَعَذْبِهَا وَسَبَخِهَا، تُرْبَةً سَنَّهَا بالمَاءِ حَتَّى
> خَلَصَتْ، وَلاَطَهَا بِالبَلَّةِ حَتَّى لَزَبَتْ، فَجَبَلَ مِنْها صُورَةً ذَاتَ أَحْنَاء وَوُصُول، وَأَعْضَاء
> وَفُصُول: أَجْمَدَهَا حَتَّى اسْتَمْسَكَتْ، وَأَصْلَدَهَا حَتَّى صَلْصَلَتْ، لِوَقْت مَعْدُود، وَأجَل مَعْلُوم،
> ثُمَّ نَفَخَ فِيها مِنْ رُوحِهِ فَمَثُلَتْ إِنْساناً ذَا أَذْهَان يُجيلُهَا، وَفِكَر يَتَصَرَّفُ بِهَا،
> وَجَوَارِحَ يَخْتَدِمُهَا، وَأَدَوَات يُقَلِّبُهَا، وَمَعْرِفَة يَفْرُقُ بِهَا بَيْنَ الحَقِّ وَالبَاطِلِ،
> والاَذْوَاقِ والَمشَامِّ، وَالاْلوَانِ وَالاْجْنَاس، مَعْجُوناً بطِينَةِ الاْلوَانِ الُمخْتَلِفَةِ،
> وَالاَشْبَاهِ المُؤْتَلِفَةِ، وَالاْضْدَادِ المُتَعَادِيَةِ، والاْخْلاطِ المُتَبَايِنَةِ، مِنَ الحَرِّ
> والبَرْدِ، وَالبَلَّةِ وَالْجُمُودِ، وَالْمَساءَةِ وَالسُّرُورِ،

Then Allah asked the angels to fulfil His promise with them and to
accomplish the pledge of His injunction to them by acknowledging Him
through prostration to Him and submission to His honoured position. So
Allah said:

**"** ***Be prostrate towards Adam and they prostrated except Iblis***
**(Satan)." (Qur'an, 2:34; 7:11; 17:61; 18:50; 20:116)**

Self-importance withheld him and vice overcame him. So that he took
pride in his own creation with fire and treated contemptuously the
creation of clay. So Allah allowed him time in order to let him fully
deserve His wrath, and to complete (man's) test and to fulfil the
promise (He had made to Satan). Thus, He said:

**"** ***Verily you have been allowed time till the known Day.*** **"
(Qur'an, 15:38; 38:81)**

> وَاسْتَأْدَى اللهُ سُبْحَانَهُ المَلائكَةَ وَدِيعَتَهُ لَدَيْهِمْ، وَعَهْدَ وَصِيَّتِهِ إِلَيْهمْ، في
> الاْذْعَانِ بالسُّجُودِ لَهُ، وَالخُنُوعِ لِتَكْرِمَتِهِ، فَقَالَ عزَّمِن قائِل: ( اسْجُدُوا لاِدَمَ
> فَسَجَدُوا إِلاَّ إِبْلِيسَ)، اعْتَرَتْهُ الحَمِيَّةُ، وَغَلَبَتْ عَلَيْهِ الشِّقْوَةُ، وَتَعَزَّزُ بِخِلْقَةِ
> النَّارِ، وَاسْتَوْهَنَ خَلْقَ الصَّلْصَالِ، فَأَعْطَاهُ اللهُ تَعالَى النَّظِرَةَ اسْتِحْقَاقاً لِلسُّخْطَةِ،
> وَاسْتِتْماماً لِلْبَلِيَّةِ، وَإِنْجَازاً لِلْعِدَةِ، فَقَالَ: (إنَّكَ مِنَ المُنْظَرِينَ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْوَقْتِ
> الْمَعْلُومِ)

Thereafter, Allah inhabited Adam (p.b.u.h.) in a house where He made his
life pleasant and his stay safe, and He cautioned him of Iblis and his
enmity. Then his enemy (Iblis) envied his abiding in Paradise and his
contacts with the virtuous. So he changed his conviction into wavering
and determination into weakness. He thus converted his happiness into
fear and his prestige into shame. Then Allah offered to Adam (p.b.u.h.)
the chance to repent, taught him words of His Mercy, promised him return
to His Paradise and sent him down to the place of trial and procreation
of progeny.

> ثُمَّ أَسْكَنَ سُبْحَانَهُ آدَمَ دَاراً أرْغَدَ فِيهَاعَيْشَهُ، وَآمَنَ فِيهَا مَحَلَّتَهُ، وَحَذَّرَهُ إِبْلِيسَ
> وَعَدَاوَتَهُ، فَاغْتَرَّهُ عَدُوُّهُ نَفَاسَةً عَلَيْهِ بِدَارِ الْمُقَامِ، وَمُرَافَقَةِ الاْبْرَارِ، فَبَاعَ
> الْيَقِينَ بِشَكِّهِ، وَالعَزِيمَةَ بِوَهْنِهِ، وَاسْتَبْدَلَ بِالْجَذَلِ وَجَلاً، وَبِالاْغْتِرَارِ نَدَماً.

> ثُمَّ بَسَطَ اللهُ سُبْحَانَهُ لَهُ في تَوْبَتِهِ، وَلَقَّاهُ كَلِمَةَ رَحْمَتِهِ، وَوَعَدَهُ المَرَدَّ إِلَى
> جَنَّتِهِ، فَأَهْبَطَهُ إِلَى دَارِ الَبَلِيَّةِ، وَتَنَاسُلِ الذُّرِّيَّةِ.

## Allah chooses His Prophets

> اختيار الانبياء

From his (Adam's) progeny Allah chose prophets and took their pledge for
his revelation and for carrying His message as their trust. In course of
time many people perverted Allah's trust with them and ignored His
position and took compeers along with Him. Satan turned them away from
knowing Him and kept them aloof from His worship. Then Allah sent His
Messengers and series of His prophets towards them to get them to fulfil
the pledges of His creation, to recall to them His bounties, to exhort
them by preaching, to unveil before them the hidden virtues of wisdom
and show them the signs of His Omnipotence namely the sky which is
raised over them, the earth that is placed beneath them, means of living
that sustain them, deaths that make them die, ailments that turn them
old and incidents that successively betake them.

> وَاصْطَفى سُبْحَانَهُ مِنْ وَلَدَهِ أَنْبيَاءَ أَخَذَ عَلَى الْوَحْيِ مِيثَاقَهُم، وَعَلَى تَبْليغِ الرِّسَالَةِ
> أَمَانَتَهُمْ، لَمَّا بَدَّلَ أَكْثَرُ خَلْقِهِ عَهْدَ اللهِ إِلَيْهِمْ، فَجَهِلُوا حَقَّهُ، واتَّخَذُوا الاْنْدَادَ
> مَعَهُ، وَاجْتَالَتْهُمُ الشَّيَاطِينُ عَنْ مَعْرفَتِهِ، وَاقتَطَعَتْهُمْ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ، فَبَعَثَ فِيهمْ
> رُسُلَهُ، وَوَاتَرَ إِلَيْهِمْ أَنْبِياءَهُ، لِيَسْتَأْدُوهُمْ مِيثَاقَ فِطْرَتِهِ، وَيُذَكِّرُوهُمْ مَنْسِيَّ نِعْمَتِهِ،
> وَيَحْتَجُّوا عَلَيْهِمْ بَالتَّبْلِيغِ، وَيُثِيرُوا لَهُمْ دَفَائِنَ الْعُقُولِ، وَيُرُوهُمْ آيَاتِ الْمَقْدِرَةِ:
> مِنْ سَقْف فَوْقَهُمْ مَرْفُوع، وَمِهَاد تَحْتَهُمْ مَوْضُوع، وَمَعَايِشَ تُحْيِيهِمْ، وَآجَال تُفْنِيهمْ،
> وَأَوْصَاب تُهْرِمُهُمْ، وَأَحْدَاث تَتَابَعُ عَلَيْهِمْ،

Allah never allowed His creation to remain without a Prophet deputised
by Him, or a book sent down from Him or a binding argument or a standing
plea. These Messengers were such that they did not feel little because
of smallness of their number or of largeness of the number of their
falsifiers. Among them was either a predecessor who would name the one
to follow or the follower who had been introduced by the predecessor.

> لَمْ يُخْلِ اللهُ سُبْحَانَهُ خَلْقَهُ مِنْ نَبِيٍّ مُرْسَل، أَوْ كِتَاب مُنْزَل، أَوْ حُجَّة لاَزِمَة، أَوْ
> مَحَجَّة قَائِمَة، رُسُلٌ لا تُقَصِّرُ بِهِمْ قِلَّةُ عَدَدِهِمْ، وَلاَ كَثْرَةُ المُكَذِّبِينَ لَهُمْ: مِنْ سَابِق
> سُمِّيَ لَهُ مَنْ بَعْدَهُ، أَوْ غَابِر عَرَّفَهُ مَنْ قَبْلَهُ.

## The Prophethood of Muhammad

> مبعث النبي (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم)

In this way ages passed by and times rolled on, fathers passed away
while sons took their places till Allah deputised Muhammad (peace be
upon him and his progeny) as His Prophet, in fulfilment of His promise
and in completion of His Prophethood. His pledge had been taken from the
Prophets, his traits of character were well reputed and his birth was
honourable. The people of the earth at this time were divided in
different parties, their aims were separate and ways were diverse. They
either likened Allah with His creation or twisted His Names or turned to
else than Him. Through Muhammad (S) Allah guided them out of wrong and
with his efforts took them out of ignorance.

> عَلَى ذْلِكَ نَسَلَتِ القُرُونُ، وَمَضَتِ الدُّهُورُ، وَسَلَفَتِ الاْباءُ، وَخَلَفَتِ الاْبْنَاءُ.

> الَى أَنْ بَعَثَ اللهُ سُبْحَانَهُ مُحَمَّداً(صلى الله عليه وآله) لاِنْجَازِ عِدَتِهِ وَتَمامِ
> نُبُوَّتِهِ، مَأْخُوذاً عَلَى النَّبِيِّينَ مِيثَاقُهُ، مَشْهُورَةً سِمَاتُهُ، كَرِيماً مِيلادُهُ. وَأهْلُ
> الاْرْضِ يَوْمَئِذ مِلَلٌ مُتَفَرِّقَةٌ، وَأَهْوَاءٌ مُنْتَشِرَةٌ، وَطَرَائِقُ مُتَشَتِّتَةٌ، بَيْنَ مُشَبِّه للهِ
> بِخَلْقِهِ، أَوْ مُلْحِد في اسْمِهِ، أَوْ مُشِير إِلَى غَيْرهِ، فَهَدَاهُمْ بهِ مِنَ الضَّلاَلَةِ،
> وَأَنْقَذَهُمْ بمَكانِهِ مِنَ الجَهَالَةِ.

Then Allah chose for Muhammad, peace be upon him and on his progeny, to
meet Him, selected him for His own nearness, regarded him too dignified
to remain in this world and decided to remove him from this place of
trial. So He drew him towards Himself with honour. Allah may shower His
blessing on him, and his progeny.

> ثُمَّ اخْتَارَ سُبْحَانَهُ لِمحَمَّد صلى الله عليه لِقَاءَهُ، وَرَضِيَ لَهُ مَا عِنْدَهُ، فَأَكْرَمَهُ عَنْ
> دَارِالدُّنْيَا، وَرَغِبَ بِهَ عَنْ مُقَارَنَةِ البَلْوَى، فَقَبَضَهُ إِلَيْهِ كَرِيماً صَلَّى اللهُ علَيهِ و
> آلِهِ،

## The Holy Qur'an and Sunnah

But the Prophet left among you the same which other Prophets left among
their peoples, because Prophets do not leave them untended (in dark)
without a clear path and a standing ensign, namely the Book of your
Creator clarifying its permission and prohibitions, its obligations and
discretion, its repealing injunctions and the repealed ones, its
permissible matters and compulsory ones, its particulars and the general
ones, its lessons and illustrations, its long and the short ones, its
clear and obscure ones, detailing its abbreviations and clarifying its
obscurities.

> وَخَلَّفَ فِيكُمْ مَا خَلَّفَتِ الاْنْبيَاءُ في أُمَمِها، إذْ لَم يَتْرُكُوهُمْ هَمَلاً، بِغَيْر طَريق

In it there are some verses whose
knowledge is obligatory and others whose ignorance by the people is
permissible. It also contains what appears to be obligatory according to
the Book but its repeal is signified by the Prophet's action
(*sunnah*) or that which appears compulsory according to the Prophet's
action but the Book allows not following it.

Or there are those which are obligatory in a given time but not so after
that time. Its prohibitions also differ. Some are major regarding which
there exists the threat of fire (Hell), and others are minor for which
there are prospects of forgiveness. There are also those of which a
small portion is also acceptable (to Allah) but they are capable of
being expanded.

## In this very sermon he spoke about Hajj

> و\[منها:\] في ذكر الحج

Allah has made obligatory upon you the pilgrimage (*Hajj*) to His sacred
House which is the turning point for the people who go to it as beasts
or pigeons go towards spring water. Allah the glorified made it a sign
of their supplication before His Greatness and their acknowledgement of
His Dignity. He selected from among His creation those who on listening
to His call responded to it and testified His word.

They stood in the position of His Prophets and resembled His angels who
surround the Divine Throne securing all the benefits of performing His
worship and hastening towards His promised forgiveness. Allah the
glorified made it (His sacred House) an emblem for Islam and an object
of respect for those who turn to it. He made obligatory its pilgrimage
and laid down its claim for which He held you responsible to discharge
it. Thus, Allah, the Glorified, said:

***". . . And (purely) for Allah, is incumbent upon mankind, the
pilgrimage to the House, for those who can afford to journey thither.
And whoever denieth then verily, Allah is Self-*** ** ***sufficiently
independent of the worlds" (Qur'an, 3:96).***

> وَفَرَضَ عَلَيْكُمْ حَجَّ بَيْتِهِ الحَرَامِ، الَّذِي جَعَلَهُ قِبْلَةً لِلاْنَامِ، يَرِدُونَهُ وُرُودَ الاَنْعَامِ،

- \"The foremost in
    religion (din) is His knowledge.\" The literal meaning of din is
    obedience, and its popular sense is code, whether literal sense is
    taken or the popular one, in either case, if the mind is devoid of
    any conception of Divinity, there would be no question of obedience,
    nor of following any code; because when there is no aim there is no
    point in advancing towards it; where there is no object in view
    there is no sense in making efforts to achieve it. Nevertheless,
    when the nature and guiding faculty of man bring him in contact with
    a superior Authority and his taste for obedience and impulse of
    submission subjugates him before a Deity, he finds himself bound by
    certain limitations as against abject freedom of activity. These
    very limitations are din (Religion) whose point of commencement is
    knowledge of Allah and acknowledgement of His
    Being.]

    After pointing out the essentials of Divine knowledge Amir
    al-mu\'minin has described its important constituents and
    conditions. He has held those stages of such knowledge which people
    generally regard as the point of highest approach to be
    insufficient. He says that its first stage is that with the natural
    sense of search for the unknown and the guidance of conscience or on
    hearing from the followers of religions an image of the Unseen Being
    known as Allah is formed in the mind. This image in fact is the
    forerunner of the obligation to thinking and reflection and to
    seeking His knowledge. But those who love idleness, or are under
    pressure of environment, do not undertake this search despite
    creation of such image and the image fails to get testified. In this
    case they remain deprived of Divine knowledge, and since their
    inaccess to the stage of testifying after the formation of image is
    by volition they deserve to be questioned about it.

    But one who is moved by the power of this image goes further and
    considers thinking and reflection necessary. In this way one reaches
    the next stage in the attainment of Divine knowledge, namely to
    search for the Creator through diversification of creation and
    species of creatures, because every picture is a solid and
    inflexible guide to the existence of its painter and every effect to
    the action of its cause.

    When he casts his glance around himself he does not find a single
    thing which might have come into existence without the act of a
    maker so much so that he does not find the sign of a footstep
    without a walker nor a construction without a builder. How can he
    comprehend that this blue sky with the sun and the moon in its
    expanse and the earth with the exuberance of its grass and flowers
    could have come into existence without the action of a Creator.
    Therefore, after observing all that exists in the world and the
    regulated system of the entire creation no one can help concluding
    that there is a Creator for this world of diversities because
    existence cannot come out of non-existence, nor can existence sprout
    forth from nothingness.\
    The Holy Qur\'an has pointed to this reasoning thus:

    \". . . What! about Allah is there any doubt, the Originator of the
    heavens and the earth ?. . .\" (14:10).

    But this stage would also be insufficient if this testimony in
    favour of Allah is tarnished by belief in the divinity of some other
    deity.

    The third stage is that His existence should be acknowledged along
    with belief in Unity and Oneness. Without this the testimony to
    Allah\'s existence cannot be complete because if more gods are
    believed in He would not be One whereas it is necessary that He
    should be One. The reason is that in case of more than one god the
    question would arise whether one of them created all this creation
    or all of them together. If one of them created it there should be
    some differential to distinguish him otherwise he would be accorded
    preferential position without reason, which is unacceptable to the
    mind. If all have created it collectively then the position has only
    two forms; either he cannot perform his functions without the
    assistance of others or he is above the need for their assistance.

    The first case means his incapability and being in need of others
    while the other case means that they are several regular performers
    of a single act and the fallacy of both has already been shown. If
    we assume that all the gods performed the act of creation by
    dividing among themselves then, in this case all the creation will,
    not bear the same relationship towards the creator since each
    creature will bear relationship only to its own creator whereas
    every creature should have one and the same relationship to all
    creators.

    This is because all the creation should have one and the same
    relationship to all the creators as all the created in their
    capacity to accept effect and all the creators in their capacity to
    produce effect should be similar. In short there is no way but to
    acknowledge Him as One because in believing in numerous creators
    there remains no possibility of the existence of any other thing,
    and destruction proves implicit for the earth, the sky and
    everything in creation. Allah the glorified has expressed this
    argument in the following words:

    \"Had there been in (the heavens and the earth \[other\] ) gods
    except Allah, they both had been in disorder. . .\" (Qur\'an,
    21:22).

    The fourth stage is that Allah should be regarded free of all
    defects and deficiencies, and devoid of body, form, illustration,
    similarity, position of place or time, motion, stillness,
    incapability and ignorance because there can be no deficiency or
    defect in the perfect Being nor can anyone be deemed like Him
    because all these attributes bring down a being from the high
    position of the Creator to the low position of the created. That is
    why along with Unity, Allah has held purity from deficiency of equal
    importance.

    \"Say: \'He (Allah) is One (alone). Allah, the needless.He begetteth
    not, nor is He begotten. And there is none like unto Him\" (Qur\'an,
    112:1-4).

    \"Vision perceiveth Him not, and He perceiveth (all) vision; He is
    the Subtle, the All-aware\" (Qur\'an, 6:104).

    \"So coin ye not any similitudes to Allah; verily Allah knoweth
    (every thing) and ye know not.\" (Qur\'an, 16:74).

    \". . .Nothing whatsoever (is there) like the like of Him; and He
    (alone) is the All-hearing and the All-seeing.\" (Qur\'an, 42:11)

    The fifth stage of completing His Knowledge is that attributes
    should not be put in Him from outside lest there be duality in His
    Oneness, and deviating from its proper connotation Unity may fall in
    the labyrinth of one in three and three in one, because His Being is
    not a combination of essence and form so that attribute may cling to
    Him like smell in the flowers or brightness in the stars. Rather, He
    is the fountain head of all attributes and needs no medium for
    manifestation of His perfect Attributes.

    If He is named Omniscient it is because the signs of his knowledge
    are manifest. If He is called Omnipotent it is because every
    particle points to His Omnipotence and Activity, and if to Him is
    attributed the power to listen or to see it is because the cohesion
    of the entire creation and its administration cannot be done without
    hearing or seeing but the existence of these attributes in Him
    cannot be held to be in the same way as in the creation namely that
    He should be capable to know only after He acquires knowledge or He
    should be powerful and strong only after energy runs into His limbs
    because taking attributes as separate from His Being would connote
    duality and where there is duality unity disappears.

    That is how Amir al-mu\'minin has rejected the idea of attributes
    being addition to His Being, presented Unity in its true
    significance, and did not allow Unity to be tainted with stains of
    multiplicity. This does not mean that adjectives cannot at all be
    attributed to Him, as this would be giving support to those who are
    groping in the dark abyss of negativism, although every nook and
    comer in the entire existence is brimming with His attributes and
    every particle of creation stands witness that He has knowledge, He
    is powerful, He hears, He sees. He nurtures under His care and
    allows growth under His mercy. The intention is that for Him nothing
    can be suggested to serve as an adjunct to Him, because His self
    includes attributes and His attributes connote His Self. Let us
    learn this very theme in the words of al-Imam Abu \`Abdillah Ja\`far
    ibn Muhammmad as-Sadiq (p.b.u.h.) comparing it with the belief in
    Unity adopted by other religions and then appreciate who is the
    exponent of the true concept of Unity.

    The Imam says:\
    \"Our Allah the Glorified, the Magnificent has ever had knowledge as
    His Self even though there was nothing to know, sight as His Self
    even though there was nothing to know, sight as His Self even though
    there was nothing to behold, hearing as His Self even though there
    was nothing to hear, and Potence as His Self even though there was
    nothing to be under His Potence. When He created the things and the
    object of knowledge came into existence His knowledge became related
    to the known, hearing related to the heard, sight related to the
    seen, and potence related to its object.\" (at-Tawhid by ash-Shaykh
    as-Saduq, p.139)

    This is the belief over which the Imams of the Prophet\'s family are
    unanimous, but the majority group has adopted a different course by
    creating the idea of differentiation between His Self and
    Attributes. ash-Shahristani says on page 42 of his book Kitab
    al-milal wa\'n-nihal:

    According to Abu\'l-Hasan al-Ash\`ari, Allah knows through (the
    attribute of) knowledge, is Powerful through activity, speaks
    through speech, hears through hearing and sees through sight.\
    If we regard attributes distinct from Self in this manner there
    would be two alternatives; either the attributes must have existed
    in Him from ever or they must have occurred later. In the first case
    we have to recognise as many eternal objects as the attributes which
    all will share with Him in being eternal, but \"Allah is above what
    the people deem Him to have equals.\" In the second case in addition
    to subjecting Him to the alternations it would also mean that before
    the acquiring of the attributes He was neither scient, nor powerful,
    nor hearer nor beholder and this runs counter to the basic tenet of
    Islam.

    \". . . Allah hath decreed trade lawful and hath forbidden interest.
    . .\" (Qur\'an, 2:275)

    \"And when you have finished the prayer remember Allah standing, and
    sitting, and reacting, and when ye are secure (from danger)
    establish prayer . . .\" (Qur\'an, 4:103)

    \"O\' ye men! eat of what is in the earth lawful and good and follow
    not the foot-steps of Satan; for verily he is an open enemy unto
    you.\" (Qur\'an, 2:168)

    \"(And) say thou: \'I am only a man like you, it is revealed unto me
    that your god is but one God, therefore whosoever desireth to meet
    his Lord, let him do good deeds, and associate not any one in the
    worship of his Lord\'.\" (Qur\'an, 18:110)

    \"What! enjoin ye upon the people righteousness and ye forget your
    own selves? Yet ye read the scripture? What: do ye not understand?\"
    (Qur\'an, 2:44).

- About the
    Qur\'an, Amir al-mu\'minin says that it contains description of the
    permitted and the forbidden acts such as \"Allah has allowed sale
    and purchase but prohibited usury.\" It clarifies obligatory and
    optional acts such as \"when you have finished the prayer (of fear)
    remember Allah rising, sitting or lying and when you feel safe (from
    the enemy) then say the prayers (as usual).\"\
    Here prayer is obligatory while other forms of remembering (Allah)
    are optional. It has repealing and repealed verses such as about the
    period of seclusion after husband\'s death \"four months and ten
    days\" or the repealed one such as \"till one year without going
    out\" which shows that this period of seclusion should be one year.
    In particular places it permits the forbidden such as \"whoever is
    compelled without being wilfully wrongful or transgressor, commits
    no sins.\"]

    It has positive injunctions such as \"One should not add anyone with
    Allah in worship.\" It has particular and general injunctions.
    Particular is the one where the word shows generality but the sense
    is limited such as \"I have made you superior over worlds, O\' Bani
    Isra\'il.\" Here the sense of \"Worlds,\" is confined to that
    particular time, although the word is general in its literal
    meaning. The general injunction is one which is extensive in meaning
    such as \"Allah has knowledge of everything.\" It has lessons and
    illustrations lessons such as \"Allah caught him in the punishment
    of this world and the next and there is lesson in it.\"

    \"So seized him Allah, with the chastisement in the hereafter, and
    the life before (it).\" (Qur\'an, 79:25)\
    \"Verily in this there is a lesson unto him who feareth (Allah).\"
    (Qur\'an, 79:26)

    \"A kind word and pardon is better than charity that is followed by
    injury, and verily Allah is Self-sufficient, the Most forbearing.\"
    (Qur\'an, 2:263)

    \"And remember when We made a covenant with you and raised the
    \'tur\' (the Mountain) above you (saying), \'Hold ye fast that which
    We have bestowed upon you with the strength (of determination) and
    remember that which is therein so that you may guard (yourself)
    against evil\'.\" (Qur\'an, 2:63)

    \"So we made it a lesson for (those of) their own times and for
    those (of their posterity) who came after them and an exhortation
    unto those who guard (themselves) against evil.\" (Qur\'an, 2:66)\
    \"He it is Who fashioneth you in the wombs (of your mothers) as He
    liketh; There is no god but He, the All-mighty, the All-wise.\"
    (Qur\'an, 3:5)

    \"Obedience and a fair word; but when the affair is determined then
    if they be true to Allah, it would certainly be better for them.\"
    (Qur\'an, 47:21)

    \"O\' those who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit women
    against their will; and do not straiten them in order that ye may
    take a part of what ye have given, unless they are guilty of
    manifest lewdness; but deal kindly with them, and if ye hate them,
    it may be that ye hate a thing while Allah hath placed in it
    abundant good.\" (Qur\'an, 4:19)

    \"Say thou (unto the people of the Book), \'Dispute ye with us about
    Allah; whereas He is our Lord and your Lord, and for us are our
    deeds and for you are your deeds; to Him (alone) we are
    (exclusively) loyal?\" (Qur\'an, 2:139)

    \"There is a lesson in it for him who fears Allah,\" and
    illustration as \"The example of those who spend their wealth in the
    way of Allah is like a grain which grows seven ears each one of
    which bears hundred grains.\" It has unspecific and specific verses.
    Unspecific is one which has no limitation on specification such as
    \"Recall when Moses told his people \'Allah commands you to
    sacrifice a cow.\'\" Specific is one where denotation is limited
    such as Allah says that \"the cow should be such that it has neither
    been used for ploughing nor for irrigation fields.\" There is clear
    and obscure in it.

    Clear is that which has no intricacy such as \"Verily Allah has sway
    over everything,\" while obscure is that whose meaning has
    complication such as \"the Merciful (Allah) occupies the throne,\"
    whose apparent meaning gives the impression as if Allah is bodily
    sitting on the Throne although the intention is to press His
    authority and control. In it there are brief injunctions such as
    \"establish prayer\" and those of deep meanings such as the verses
    about which says:\
    \"That the sense is not known except to Allah and those immersed in
    knowledge.\" Then Amir al-mu\'minin dilates upon this theme in a
    different style, he says that there are some things in it which are
    necessary to know, such as \"So know that there is no god but
    Allah\" and there are others which are not necessary to know such as
    \"alif lam mim\" etc. It has also injunctions which have been
    repealed by the Prophet\'s action such as \"As for your women who
    commit adultery get four male witnesses and if four witnesses do
    appear shut such women in the house till death ends their life.\"\
    This punishment was current in early Islam but was later replaced by
    stoning in the case of married women. In it there are some
    injunctions which repealed the Prophet\'s action such as \"Turn your
    face towards Masjid al-haram\" by which the injunction for facing
    Bayt al-maqdis was repealed. It also contains injunctions which are
    obligatory only at a particular time after which their obligation
    ends, such as \"when the call for prayer is made on Friday then
    hasten towards remembrance of Allah.\" It has also indicated grades
    of prohibitions as the division of sins into light and serious
    ones - light such as \"Tell the believers to lower their eyes\" and
    serious ones such as \"whoever kills a Believer wilfully his award
    is to remain in Hell for ever.\" It also contains injunctions where
    a little performance is enough but there is scope for further
    performance such as \"Read the Qur\'an as much as you easily can.\"

    \"Verily your Lord, certainly is He the All-mighty, the
    All-merciful.\" (Qur\'an, 26:9)

    \"Say thou (O\' Our Prophet Muhammmad) unto the believer men that
    they cast down their gaze and guard their private parts; that is
    purer for them; verily Allah is All-aware of what (all) ye do.\"
    (Qur\'an, 24:30)

    \"Not equal are those of the believers who sit (holding back) other
    than those hurt, and those who strive in the way of Allah with their
    wealth and their selves (lives). Allah hath raised the strivers with
    their wealth and selves (lives), in rank above those sitting
    (holding back); Unto all (in faith) Allah hath promised good; but
    those who strive, He hath distinguished above those who sit (holding
    \[by\]) a great recompense.\" (Qur\'an, 4:95)

    \"Verily, thy Lord knowest that thou standest up (in the Night
    Prayer) night two-third of the night, and (sometimes) half of it,
    and (sometimes) a third of it, and a group of those with thee; and
    Allah measureth (well) the night and the day; Knoweth He that never
    can ye take (correct) account of it, so turneth He unto you
    (mercifully) so recite ye whatever be easy (in the prayers) to be
    read of the Qur\'an; Knoweth He that there may be among you sick,
    and others travelling in the earth seeking of the grace of Allah,
    and others fighting in the way of Allah, so recite ye as much as it
    can easily be done of it, and establish ye the (regular) prayers,
    and pay ye the (prescribed) poor-rate, and offer ye unto Allah a
    goodly loan; and whatsoever of good ye send on before hand for
    yourselves, ye will (surely) find it with Allah, that is the best
    and the greatest recompense; and seek ye the forgiveness of Allah;
    Verily, Allah is Oft-forgiving, the Most Merciful.\" (Qur\'an,
    73:20)
