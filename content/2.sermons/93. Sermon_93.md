*About the annihilation of the Kharijites, the mischief mongering of
Umayyads and the vastness of his own knowledge*

> ومن خطبة له عليه السلام

> وفيها ينبِّه أَمير المؤمنين على فضله وعلمه ويبيّن فتنة بني أُميّة

Praise and eulogy be to Allah, O people, I have put out the eye of
revolt. No one except me advanced towards it when its gloom was swelling
and its madness was intense. Ask me before you miss me,

because, by Allah, who has my life in His hands, if you ask me anything
between now and the Day of Judgement or about the group who would guide
a hundred people and also misguide a hundred people I would tell you who
is announcing its march, who is driving it in the front and who is
driving it at the rear, the stages where its riding animals would stop
for rest and the final place of stay, and who among them would be killed
and who would die a natural death.

> أَمَّا بَعْد، أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ فَإِنِّي فَقَأْتُ عَيْنَ الْفِتْنَةِ، وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لِيَجْتَرِىءَ عَلَيْهَا أَحَدٌ
> غَيْرِي بَعْدَ أَنْ مَاجَ غَيْهَبُهَا، وَاشْتَدَّ كَلَبُهَا فَاسْأَلُوني قَبْلَ أَنْ تَفْقِدُونِي، فَوَ الَّذِي
> نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لاَ تَسْأَلُوني عَنْ شَيْء فِيَما بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَ السَّاعَةِ، وَلاَ عَنْ فِئَة تَهْدِي
> مائةً وَتُضِلُّ مائةً إِلاَّ نَبَّأْتُكُمْ بِنَاعِقِهَا وَقَائِدِهَا وَسَائِقِهَا، وَمنَاخِ رِكَابِهَا، وَمَحَطِّ
> رِحَالِهَا، وَمَنْ يُقْتَلُ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا قَتْلاً، وَمَنْ يَمُوتُ مِنْهُمْ مَوْتاً.

When I am dead, hard circumstances and distressing events will befall
you, many persons in the position of asking questions will remain silent
with cast down eye, while those in the position of replying will lose
courage. This would be at a time when wars will descend upon you with
all hardship and days will be so hard on you that you would feel them
prolonged because of hardship till Allah will give victory to those
remaining virtuous among you.

> وَلَوْ قَدْ فَقَدْتُمُونِي وَنَزَلَتْ كَرَائِهُ الاْمُورِ، وَحَوَازِبُ الْخُطُوبِ، لاَطْرَقَ كَثِيرٌ مِنَ
> السَّائِلِينَ، وَفَشِلَ كَثِيرٌ مِنَ المَسْؤُولِينَ، وَذلِكَ إِذَا قَلَّصَتْ حَرْبُكُمْ، وَشَمَّرَتْ عَنْ سَاق،
> وَضَاقَتِ الدُّنْيَا عَلَيْكُمْ ضِيقاً، تَسْتَطِيلُونَ أَيَّامَ الْبَلاَءِ عَلَيْكُمْ، حَتَّى يَفْتَحَ اللهُ
> لِبَقِيَّةِ الاْبْرَارِ مِنْكُمْ.

When mischiefs come they confuse (right with wrong) and when they clear
away they leave a warning. They cannot be known at the time of approach
but are recognised at the time of return. They blow like the blowing of
winds, striking some cities and missing others.

Beware that the worst mischief for you in my view is the mischief of
Banu Umayyah, because it is blind and also creates darkness. Its sway is
general but its ill effects are for particular people. He who remains
clear-sighted in it would be affected by distress, and he who remains
blind in it would avoid the distress.

By Allah, you will find Banu Umayyah after me worst people for
yourselves, like the old unruly she-camel who bites with its mouth,
beats with its fore-legs, kicks with its hind legs and refuses to be
milked. They would remain over you till they would leave among you only
those who benefit them or those who do not harm them.

Their calamity would continue till your seeking help from them would
become like the seeking of help by the slave from his master or of the
follower from the leader. Their mischief would come to you like evil
eyed fear and pre-Islamic fragments, wherein there would be neither
minaret of guidance nor any sign (of salvation) to be seen.

> إِنّ الْفِتَنَ إِذَا أَقْبَلَتْ شَبَّهِتْ، وَإِذَا أَدْبَرَتْ نَبَّهَتْ، يُنْكَرْنَ مُقْبِلاَت، وَيُعْرَفْنَ مُدْبِرَات،
> يَحُمْنَ حَوْمَ الرِّيَاحِ، يُصِبْنَ بَلَداً وَيُخْطِئْنَ بَلَداً.

> أَلاَ وَإِنَّ أَخْوَفَ الْفِتَنِ عِنْدِي عَلَيْكُمْ فَتْنَةُ بَنِي اُمَيَّةَ، فإِنَّهَا فِتْنَةٌ عَمْيَاءُ مُظْلِمَةٌ:
> عَمَّتْ خُطَّتُهَا، وَخَصَّتْ بَلِيَّتُهَا، وَأَصَابَ الْبَلاَءُ مَنْ أَبْصَرَ فِيهَا، وَأَخْطَأَ الْبَلاَءُ مَنْ عَمِيَ
> عَنْهَا. وَايْمُ اللهِ لَتَجِدُنَّ بَنِي أُمَيَّةَ لَكُمْ أَرْبَابَ سُوْء بَعْدِي، كَالنَّابِ الضَّرُوسِ: تَعْذِمُ
> بِفِيهَا، وَتَخْبِطُ بِيَدِهَا، وتَزْبِنُ بِرِجْلِهَا، وَتَمْنَعُ دَرَّهَا، لاَ يَزَالُونَ بِكُمْ حَتَّى لاَ
> يَتْرُكُوا مَنْكُمْ إِلاَّ نَافِعاً لَهُمْ، أَوْ غَيْرَ ضَائِر بِهِمْ، وَلاَ يَزَالُ بَلاَؤُهُمْ حَتَّى لاَ
> يَكُونَ انْتِصَارُ أَحَدِكُمْ مِنْهُمْ إِلاَّ مثل انْتِصَارِ الْعَبْدِ مِنْ رَبِّهِ، وَالصَّاحِبِ مِنْ
> مُسْتَصْحِبِهِ، تَرِدُ عَلَيْكُمْ فِتْنَتُهُمْ شَوْهَاءَ مَخْشَيَّةً، وَقِطَعاً جَاهِلِيَّةً، لَيْسَ فِيهَا مَنَارُ
> هُدىً، وَلاَ عَلَمٌ يُرَى.

We *Ahlul Bayt* (the Household of the Prophet) are free from this
mischief and we are not among those who would engender it. Thereafter,
Allah would dispel it from you like the removal of the skin (from flesh)
through him who would humble them, drag them by necks, make them drink
full cups (of hardships), not extend them anything but sword and not
clothe them save with fear. At that time Quraysh would wish at the cost
of the world and all its contents to find me even only once and just for
the duration of the slaughter of a camel in order that I may accept from
them (the whole of) that of which at present I am asking them only a
part but they are not giving me.

> نَحْنُ أَهْلَ الْبِيْتِ مِنْهَا بنجاة، وَلَسْنَا فِيهَا بِدُعَاة، ثُمَّ يُفَرِّجُهَا اللهُ عَنْكُمْ كَتَفْرِيجِ
> الاْدِيمِ: بِمَنْ يَسُومُهُمْ خَسْفاً، وَيَسُوقُهُمْ عُنْفاً، وَيَسْقِيهِمْ بِكَأْس مُصَبَّرَة، لاَ يُعْطِيهِمْ
> إِلاَّ السَّيْفَ، وَلاَ يُحْلِسُهُمْ إِلاَّ الْخَوْفَ، فَعِنْدَ ذلِكَ تَوَدُّ قُرَيْشٌ ـ بِالدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا
> ـ لَوْ يَرَوْنَنِي مَقَاماً وَاحِداً، وَلَوْ قَدْرَ جَزْرِ جَزْور، لاِقْبَلَ مِنْهُمْ مَا أَطْلُبُ الْيَوْمَ
> بَعْضَهُ فَلاَ يُعْطُونِيهِ!

-  Amir al-mu\'minin
    delivered this sermon after the battle of Nahrawan. In it, mischiefs
    imply the battles fought in Basrah, Siffin and Nahrawan because
    their nature was different from the battles of the Prophet. There
    the opposite party was the unbelievers while here the confrontation
    was with those who had veils of Islam on their faces. So people were
    hesitant to fight against Muslims, and asked why they should fight
    with those who recited the call to the prayers and offered the
    prayers. Thus, Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al-Ansari did not take part in
    the Battle of Siffin till the falling of \`Ammar ibn Yasir as martyr
    did not prove that the opposite party was rebellious. Similarly the
    presence of companions like Talhah and az-Zubayr who were included
    in the \"Foretold Ten\" on the side of \`A\'ishah in Basrah, and the
    prayer signs on foreheads of the Kharijites in Nahrawan and their
    prayers and worship were creating confusion in the minds. In these
    circumstances only those could have the courage to rise against them
    were aware of the secrets of their hearts and the reality of their
    faith. It was the peculiar perception of Amir al-mu\'minin and his
    spiritual courage that he rose to oppose them, and testified the
    saying of the Holy Prophet:\
    You will fight after me with the breakers of allegiance (people of
    Jamal), oppressors (people of Syria) and deviators (the Kharijites).

-  After the Holy
    Prophet no one save Amir al-mu\'minin could utter the challenge
    \"Ask whatever you want to.\" Ibn \`Abd al-Barr in Jami\` bayan
    al-\`ilm wa fadlihi, vol.1 p.58 and in al-Isti\`ab, vol.3, p.l103;
    Ibn al-Athir in Usd al-ghabah, vol.4, p.22; Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid in
    Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol.7, p.46; as-Suyuti in Tarikh
    al-Khulafa\', p.171 and Ibn Hajar al-Haytami in as-Sawa\`iq
    al-muhriqah, p.76 have written that \"None among the companions of
    the Holy Prophet ever said \'Ask me whatever you want to\' except
    \`Ali ibn Abi Talib.\" However, among other than the companions a
    few names do appear in history who did utter such a challenge, such
    as Ibrahim ibn Hisham al-Makhzumi, Muqatil ibn Sulayman, Qatadah ibn
    Di\`amah, \`Abd ar-Rahman (Ibn al-Jawzi) and Muhammad ibn Idris
    ash-Shafi\`i etc. but everyone of them had to face disgrace and was
    forced to take back his challenge. This challenge can be urged only
    by him who knows the realities of the Universe and is aware of the
    happenings of the future. Amir al-mu\'minin, the opener of the door
    of the Prophet\'s knowledge, as he was, was the only person who was
    never seen being unable to answer any question on any occasion, so
    much so that even Caliph \`Umar had to say that \"I seek Allah\'s
    protection from the difficulty for the solution of which \`Ali would
    not be available.\" Similarly, the prophecies of Amir al-mu\'minin
    made about the future proved true word by word and served as an
    index to his vast knowledge, whether they be about the devastation
    of Banu Ummayyah or the rising of the Kharijites, the wars and
    destruction by the Tartars or the attacks of the English, the floods
    of Basrah of the ruination of Kufah. In short, when these events are
    historical realities there is no reason why this challenge of Amir
    al-mu\'minin should be wondered at.]
