When{#epub.html_fref_eee30adb_1
.see-footnote} Allah gave him (Amir al-mu'minin) victory over the enemy
at the Battle of Jamal one of his comrades said on that occasion, "I
wish my brother so-and-so had been present and he too would have seen
what success and victory Allah had given you," whereupon Amir
al-mu'minin said:

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> لمّا أظفره الله تعالى بأصحاب الجمل وقد قال له بعض أصحابه:

> وددت أن أخي فلاناً معك شاهداً ليرى ما نصرك الله به على أعدائك، فقال له
> عليه السلام

"Did your brother hold me friend?"

He said: "Yes,"

Then Amir al-mu'minin said:

In that case he was with us. Rather in this army of ours even those
persons were also present who are still in the loins of men and wombs of
women. Shortly, time will bring them out and faith will get strength
through them.

> أَهَوَى أَخِيك مَعَنَا؟

> قال: نَعَم.

> قالَ: فَقَدْ شَهِدنَا، وَلَقَدْ شَهِدَنَا في عَسْكَرِنَا هذَا أَقْوَامٌ في أَصْلاَبِ الرِّجَالِ، وَأَرْحَامِ
> النِّسَاءِ، سَيَرْعُفُ بِهِمُ الزَّمَانُ، ويَقْوَى بِهِمُ الاْيمَانُ.

\(1\) Al-Barqi, *al-Mahasin,* I*,* 262.

-  If a person falls
    short in his actions despite means and equipment, this would be
    indicative of the weakness of his will. But if there is an
    impediment in the way of action or his life comes to an end as a
    result of which his action remains incomplete, then in that case
    Allah would not deprive him of the reward on the basis that actions
    are judged by intention. Since his intention in any case was to
    perform the action, therefore he should deserve reward to some
    extent.]

    In the case of action, there may be absence of reward because action
    can involve show or pretence but intention is hidden in the depth of
    heart. It can have not a jot of show or affectation. The intention
    would remain at the same level of frankness, truth, perfection and
    correctness where it is, even though there may be no action due to
    some impediment. Even if there is no occasion for forming intention
    but there is passion and zeal in the heart, a man would deserve
    reward on the basis of his heart\'s feelings. This is to what Amir
    al-mu\'minin has alluded in this sermon, namely that \"If your
    brother loved me he would share the reward with those who secured
    martyrdom for our support.\"
