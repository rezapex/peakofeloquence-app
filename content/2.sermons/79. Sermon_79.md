*When*  *Amir al-mu'minin decided to set out for the battle with
the Kharijites someone said, "If you set out at this moment then
according to astrology I fear you will not be successful in your aim,"
whereupon Amir al-mu'minin said:*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> لبعض أصحابه لمّا عزم على المسير إِلى الخوارج، فقال له: يا أميرالمؤمنين
> إن سرت في هذا الوقت، خشيتُ ألاَّ تظفر بمرادك، من طريق علم النجوم، فقال
> (عليه السلام):

Do you think you can tell the time when a man goes out and no evil
befall him or can warn of the time at which if one goes out harm will
accrue? Whoever testifies to this falsifies the Qur'an and becomes
unmindful of Allah in achieving his desired objective and in warding off
the undesirable. You cherish saying this so that he who acts on what you
say should praise you rather than Allah because according to your
misconception you have guided him about the hour in which he would
secure benefit and avoid harm.

> أَتَزْعَمُ أَنَّكَ تَهْدِي إِلَى السَّاعَةِ الَّتِي مَنْ سَارَ فِيهَا صُرِفَ عَنْهُ السُّوءُ؟ وَتُخَوِّفُ مِنَ
> السَّاعَةِ الَّتي مَنْ سَارَ فِيهَا حَاقَ بِهِ الضُّرُّ؟ فَمَنْ صَدَّقَكَ بِهذَا فَقَدْ كَذَّبَ الْقُرْآنَ،
> وَاسْتَغْنَى عَنِ الاِسْتِعَانَةِ بِاللهِ عزّوجلّ فِي نَيْلِ الْمحْبُوبِ وَدَفْعِ الْمَكْرُوهِ، وَتَبْتَغِي
> في قوْلِكَ لِلْعَامِلِ بِأَمْرِكَ أَنْ يُولِيَكَ الْحَمْدَ دُونَ رَبِّهِ، لاَِنَّكَ ـ بِزَعْمِكَ ـ أَنْتَ هَدَيْتَهُ
> إِلَى السَّاعَةِ الَّتِي نَالَ فِيهَا النَّفْعَ، وَأَمِنَ الضُّرَّ!!

Then Amir al-mu'minin advanced towards the people and said:

O People! Beware of learning the science of stars except that with which
guidance is sought on land or sea, because it leads to divining and an
astrologer is a diviner, while the diviner is like the sorcerer, the
sorcerer is like the unbeliever and the unbeliever would be in Hell. Get
forward in the name of Allah.

> أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، إِيَّاكُمْ وَتَعَلُّمَ النُّجُومِ، إِلاَّ مَا يُهْتَدَى بِهِ في بَرٍّ أَوْ بَحْر، فَإِنَّهَا
> تَدْعُو إِلَى الْكَهَانَةِ، والمُنَجَّمُ كَالْكَاهِنِ، وَالْكَاهِنُ كَالسَّاحِرِ، وَالسَّاحِرُ كَالْكَافِرِ!
> وَالْكَافِرُ في النَّارِ! سِيرُوا عَلَى اسْمِ اللهِ.

-  When Amir
    al-mu\'minin decided to march towards Nahrawan to suppress the
    rising of the Kharijites, \`Afif ibn Qays al-Kindi said to him,
    \"This hour is not good. If you set out at this time. then instead
    of victory and success you will face defeat and vanquishment.\" But
    Amir al-mu\'minin paid no heed to his view and ordered the army to
    march that very moment. In the result the Kharijites suffered such a
    clear defeat that out of their nine thousand combatants only nine
    individuals saved their lives by running away while the rest were
    killed.\
    Amir al-mu\'minin has argued about astrology being wrong or
    incorrect in three ways, firstly, that if the view of an astrologer
    is accepted as correct it would mean falsification of the Qur\'an,
    because an astrologer claims to ascertain hidden things of the
    future by seeing the stars while the Qur\'an says:\
    Say: \"None (either) in the heavens or in the earth knoweth the
    unseen save Allah\... \" (27:65)\
    Secondly that under his misconception the astrologer believes that
    he can know his benefit or harm through knowing the future. In that
    case he would be regardless of turning to Allah and seeking His
    help, while this indifference towards Allah and self-reliance is a
    sort of heresy and atheism, which puts an end to his hope in Allah.
    Thirdly, that if he succeeds in any objective, he would regard this
    success to be the result of his knowledge of astrology, as a result
    of which he would praise himself rather than Allah, and will expect
    that whomever he guides in this manner he too should be grateful to
    him rather than to Allah . These points do not apply to astrology to
    the extent it may be believed that the astrological findings are in
    the nature of effect of medicines which are subject to alteration at
    the will of Allah. The competence achieved by most of our religious
    scholars in astrology is correct in this very ground that they did
    not regard its findings as final.]
