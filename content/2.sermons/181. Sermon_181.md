Amir al-mu\'minin sent one of his men to bring him news about a group of
the army of Kufah who had decided to join the Kharijites but were afraid
of him.  When the man came back Amir al-mu\'minin said to him:
\"Are they satisfied and staying or feeling weak and going astray?\" The
man replied, \"They have gone away, O\' Amir al-mu\'minin.\" Then Amir
al-mu\'minin said:

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> وقد أَرسل رجلاً من أصحابه، يَعْلَمُ له عِلمَ \[أحوال\] قوم من جند الكوفة، همّوا
> باللحاق بالخوارج، وكانوا على خوف منه (عليه السلام)، فلمّا عاد إليه
> الرجل قال له:

> أأمِنُوا فَقَطَنُوا، أم جبنوا فَظَعَنُوا؟

> ): . فقال (عليه السلام فقال الرجل: بل ظَعَنُوا يا أَميرالمؤمنين.

May Allah\'s mercy remain away from them

***"..just as Thamud was distanced (from His mercy)"*** **(11:95).**

Know that when the spears are hurled towards them and the swords are
struck at their heads they will repent of their doings. Surely today
Satan has scattered them and tomorrow he will disclaim any connection
with them, and will leave them. Their departing from guidance, returning
to misguidance and blindness, turning away from truth and falling into
wrong is enough (for their chastisement).

> بُعْداً لَهُمْ (كَمَا بَعِدَتْ ثَمُودُ)! أَمَا لَوْ أُشْرِعَتِ الاْسِنَّةُ إِلَيْهِمْ وَصُبَّتِ السُّيُوفُ عَلَى
> هَامَاتِهمْ، لَقَدْ نَدِمُوا عَلَى مَا كَانَ مِنْهُمْ، إنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ الْيَوْمَ قَدِ اسْتَقَلَّهُمْ، وَهُوَ
> غَداً مُتَبَرِّىءٌ مِنْهُمْ، وَمُخلٍّ عَنْهُمْ، فَحَسْبُهُمْ بِخُرُوجِهمْ مِنَ الْهُدَى، وَارْتِكَاسِهِمْ فِي
> الضَّلاَل وَالْعَمَى، وَصَدِّهِمْ عَنِ الْحَقّ، وَجِمَاحِهمْ فِي التِيهِ.

-  A man of the
    tribe Banu Najiyah named al-Khirrit ibn Rashid an-Naji was on Amir
    al-mu\'minin\'s side in the battle of Siffin, but after Arbitration
    he became rebellious, and, coming to Amir al-mu\'minin with thirty
    persons, said: \"By Allah, I Will no more obey your command, nor
    offer prayers behind you, and shall leave you tomorrow.\" Whereupon
    Amir al-mu\'minin said: \"You should first take into account the
    grounds underlying this Arbitration and discuss it with me. If you
    are satisfied, you do as you will.\" He said he would come the next
    day to discuss the matter. Amir al-mu\'minin then cautioned him,
    \"Look, on going from here do not get mislead by others and do not
    adopt any other course. If you have the will to understand, I will
    get you out of this wrong path and put you on the course of
    guidance.\" After this conversation he went away, but his
    countenance indicated he was bent on revolt, and would not see
    reason by any means. And so it happened. He stuck to his point and
    on reaching his place he said to his tribesmen, \"When we are
    determined to abandon Amir al-mu\'minin there is no use going to
    him. We should do what we have decided to do.\" On this occasion
    \`Abdullah ibn Qu\`ayn al Azdi also went to them to enquire, but
    when he came to know the position he asked Mudrik ibn ar-Rayyan
    an-Naji to speak to him and to apprise him of the ruinous
    consequence of this rebellion, whereupon Mudrik assured him that
    this man would not be allowed to take any step. Consequently,
    \`Abdullah came back satisfied and related the whole matter before
    Amir al-mu\'minin on returning the next day. Amir al-mu\'minin said,
    \"Let us see what happens when he comes. \" But when the appointed
    hour passed and he did not turn up Amir al-mu\'minin asked
    \`Abdullah to go and see what the matter was and what was the cause
    for the delay. On reaching there \`Abdullah found that all of them
    had left. When he returned to Amir al-mu\'minin he spoke as in this
    sermon.\
    The fate that befell al-Khirrit ibn Rashid an-Naji has been stated
    under Sermon 44.]
