*Amir al-mu'minin's far-sightedness and his staunch conviction in
Belief*

> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام)

> وهي من أفصح كلامه (عليه السلام)، وفيها يعظ الناس ويهديهم من ضلالتهم،

> ويقال: إنه خطبها بعد قتل طلحة والزبير

Through us you got guidance in the darkness and secured high position,
and through us you got out of the gloomy night. The ears which do not
listen to the cries may become deaf. How can one who remained deaf to
the loud cries (of the Qur'an and the Prophet) listen to (my) feeble
voice? The heart that has ever palpitated (with fear of Allah) may get
peace.

> بِنَا اهْتَدَيْتُمْ في الظَّلْمَاءِ، وَتَسَنَّمْتُمُ العلْيَاءَ، وبِنَا انْفَجَرْتُم عَنِ السِّرَارِ، وُقِرَ
> سَمْعٌ لَمْ يَفْقَهِ الوَاعِيَةَ، كَيْفَ يُرَاعِي النَّبْأَةَ مَنْ أَصَمَّتْهُ الصَّيْحَةُ؟ رُبِطَ جَنَانٌ لَمْ
> يُفَارِقْهُ الخَفَقَانُ.

I always apprehended from you consequences of treachery and I had seen
you through in the garb of the deceitful. The curtain of religion had
kept me hidden from you but the truth of my intentions disclosed you to
me. I stood for you on the path of truth among misleading tracks where
you met each other but there was no leader and you dug but got no water.

> مَا زِلتُ أَنْتَظِرُ بِكُمْ عَوَاقِبَ الغَدْرِ، وَأَتَوَسَّمُكُمْ بِحِلْيَةِ الـمُغْتَرِّينَ ، سَتَرَني عَنْكُمْ
> جِلْبَابُ الدِّينِ، وَبَصَّرَنِيكُمْ صِدْقُ النِّيَّةِ، أَقَمْتُ لَكُمْ عَلَى سَنَنِ الحَقِّ في جَوَادِّ
> الـمَضَلَّةِ، حيْثُ تَلْتَقُونَ وَلا دَلِيلَ، وَتَحْتَفِرُونَ وَلا تُميِهُونَ.

Today I am making these dumb things speak to you (i.e. my suggestive
ideas and deep musings etc.) which are full of descriptive power. The
opinion of the person who abandons me may get astray. I have never
doubted in the truth since it has been shown to me. Musa
(Moses) did not entertain fear for his own self. Rather he
apprehended mastery of the ignorant and away of deviation. Today we
stand on the cross-roads of truth and untruth. The one who is sure of
getting water feels no thirst.

> اليَوْمَ أُنْطِقُ لَكُمُ العَجْمَاءَ ذاتَ البَيَان! عَزَبَ رَأْيُ امْرِىء تَخَلَّفَ عَنِّي، مَا شَكَكْتُ في
> الحَقِّ مُذْ أُرِيتُهُ! لَمْ يُوجِسْ مُوسَى خِيفَةً عَلَى نَفْسِهِ، أَشْفَقَ مِنْ غَلَبَةِ الجُهَّالِ وَدُوَلِ
> الضَّلالِ! اليَوْمَ تَوَاقَفْنَا عَلَى سَبِيلِ الحَقِّ وَالباطِلِ، مَنْ وَثِقَ بِمَاء لَمْ يَظْمَأْ!

-  The reference is
    to that event of Moses when sorcerers were sent for to confront him
    and they showed their sorcery by throwing ropes and sticks on the
    ground and Moses felt afraid. Thus, the Qur\'an records:
    .]

    . it seemed to him (Moses), by their sorcery as if they were
    running.Then Moses felt in himself a fear. We said: Fear not! Verily
    thou art the uppermost. (20:66-68)

    Amir al-mu\'minin says that the ground for Moses' fear was not that
    since he saw ropes and sticks moving he might have entertained fear
    for his life but the cause of his fear was lest people be impressed
    with this sorcery and get astray, and untruth might prevail on
    account of this craft. That is why Moses was not consoled by saying
    that his life was safe but by saying that he would prove superior,
    and his claim would be upheld.

    Since his fear was for the defeat of the truth and victory of the
    untruth, not for his own life, the consideration was given to him
    for the victory of truth and not for the protection of his life.
    Amir al-mu\'minin also means that he too had the same fear viz. that
    the people should not be caught in the trap of these (Talhah,
    az-Zubayr, etc.) and fail into misguidance by getting astray from
    the true faith. Otherwise, he himself never feared for his own life.
