*Amir al-mu'minin said in disparagement of the differences of view among
the theologians*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> في ذمّ اختلاف العلماء في الفتيا

> \[وفيه يذم أهل الرأي ويكل أمر الحكم في أمور الدين للقرآن\]

When{#epub.html_fref_47eefda3_1
.see-footnote} a problem is put before anyone of them he passes
judgement on it from his imagination. When exactly the same problem is
placed before another of them he passes an opposite verdict. Then these
judges go to the chief who had appointed them and he confirms all the
verdicts, although their Allah is One (and the same), their Prophet is
one (and the same), their Book (the Qur'an) is one (and the same)!

> تَرِدُ عَلَى أحَدِهِمُ القَضِيَّةُ في حُكْمٍ مِنَ الاْحْكَامِ فَيَحْكُمُ فِيهَا بِرَأْيِهِ، ثُمَّ تَرِدُ تِلْكَ
> القَضِيَّةُ بِعَيْنِهَا عَلَى غَيْرِهِ فَيَحْكُمُ فِيها بِخِلافِ قَوْلِهِ، ثُمَّ يَجْتَمِعُ القُضَاةُ بِذلِكَ عِنْدَ
> إمامِهِم الَّذِي اسْتَقْضَاهُم فَيُصَوِّبُ آرَاءَهُمْ جَمِيعاً، وَإِلهُهُمْ وَاحِدٌ! وَنَبِيُّهُمْ وَاحِدٌ!
> وَكِتَابُهُمْ وَاحِدٌ!

Is it that Allah ordered them to differ and they obeyed Him? Or He
prohibited them from it but they disobeyed Him? Or (is it that) Allah
sent an incomplete Faith and sought their help to complete it? Or they
are His partners in the affairs, so that it is their share of duty to
pronounce and He has to agree? Or is it that Allah the Glorified sent a
perfect faith but the Prophet fell short of conveying it and handing it
over (to the people)? The fact is that Allah the Glorified says:

***We have not neglected anything in the Book (Qur'an) . . . (6:38),***

and in it is a 'clarification of
everything'{#epub.html_fref_97dfe1b3_2
.see-footnote} And He says that one part of the Qur'an verifies another
part and that there is no divergence in it as He says:

***.And if it had been from any other than Allah, they would surely have
found in it much discrepancy. (4:82)***

> أَفَأَمَرَهُمُ اللهُ ـ سُبْحَانَهُ ـ بِالاخْتلاَفِ فَأَطَاعُوهُ! أَمْ نَهَاهُمْ عَنْهُ فَعَصَوْهُ! أَمْ أَنْزَلَ
> اللهُ سُبْحَانَهُ دِيناً نَاقِصاً فَاسْتَعَانَ بِهِمْ عَلَى إِتْمَامِهِ! أَمْ كَانُوا شُرَكَاءَ لَهُ فَلَهُمْ
> أَنْ يَقُولُوا وَعَلَيْهِ أَنْ يَرْضِى؟ أَمْ أَنْزَلَ اللهُ سُبْحَانَهُ دِيناً تَامّاً فَقَصَّرَ الرَّسُولُ
> (صلى الله عليه وآله) عَنْ تَبْلِيغِهِ وَأَدَائِهِ؟ وَاللهُ سُبْحَانَهُ يَقُولُ: (مَا فَرَّطْنَا في
> الكِتَابِ مِنْ شَيْء) وَفِيهِ تِبْيَانٌ لِكُلِّ شَيْء، وَذَكَرَ أَنَّ الكِتَابَ يُصَدِّقُ بَعْضُهُ بَعْضاً، وَأَنَّهُ
> لاَ اخْتِلافَ فِيهِ، فَقَالَ سُبْحَانَهُ: (وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِنْدِ غَيرِ اللهِ لَوَجَدُوا فِيهِ
> اخْتِلافاً كَثِيراً)

Certainly the outside of the Qur'an is wonderful and its inside is deep
(in meaning). Its wonders will never disappear, its amazements will
never pass away and its intricacies cannot be cleared except through
itself.

> وَإِنَّ القُرآنَ ظَاهِرُهُ أَنِيقٌ وَبَاطِنُهُ عَمِيقٌ، لاَ تَفْنَى عَجَائِبُهُ، وَلاَتَنْقَضِي غَرَائِبُهُ،
> وَلاَ تُكْشَفُ الظُّلُمَاتُ إلاَّ بِهِ.

-  It is a disputed
    problem that where there is no clear argument about a matter in the
    religious law, whether there does in reality exist an order about it
    or not. The view adopted by Abu\'l-Hasan al-Ash\`ari and his master
    Abu \`Ali al-Jubba\'i is that in such a case Allah has not ordained
    any particular course of action but He assigned the task of finding
    it out and passing a verdict to the jurists so that whatever they
    hold as prohibited would be deemed prohibited and whatever they
    regard permissible would be deemed permissible. And if one has one
    view and the other another then as many verdicts will exist as there
    are views and each of them would represent the final order. For
    example, if one scholar holds that barley malt is prohibited and
    another jurist\'s view is that it is permissible then it would
    really be both prohibited and permissible. That is, for one who
    holds it prohibited, its use would be prohibited while for the other
    its use would be permissible. About this (theory of) correctness
    Muhammad ibn Abdi\'l-Karim ash-Shahrastani writes:\
    A group of theorists hold that in matters where ijtihad (research)
    is applied there is no settled view about permissibility or
    otherwise and lawfulness and prohibition thereof, but whatever the
    mujtahid (the researcher scholar) holds is the order of Allah,
    because the ascertainment of the view of Allah depends upon the
    verdict of the mujtahid. If it is not so there will be no verdict at
    all. And according to this view every mujtahid would be correct in
    his opinion. (al-Milal wa\'l-nihal, p.98)\
    In this case, the mujtahid is taken to be above mistake because a
    mistake can be deemed to occur where a step is taken against
    reality, but where there is no reality of verdict, mistake has no
    sense. Besides this, the mujtahid can be considered to be above
    mistake if it is held that Allah, being aware of all the views that
    were likely to be adopted has ordained as many final orders as a
    result of which every view corresponds to some such order, or that
    Allah has assured that the views adopted by the mujtahids should not
    go beyond what He has ordained, or that by chance the view of every
    one of them would, after all, correspond to some ordained order or
    other.\
    The Imamiyyah sect, however, has different theory, namely that Allah
    has neither assigned to anyone the right to legislate nor subjected
    any matter to the view of the mujtahid, nor in case of difference of
    views has He ordained numerous real orders. Of course, if the
    mujtahid cannot arrive at a real order then whatever view he takes
    after research and probe, it is enough for him and his followers to
    act by it. Such an order is the apparent order which is a substitute
    for the real order. In this case, he is excused for missing the real
    order, because he did his best for diving in the deep ocean and to
    explore its bottom, but it is a pity that instead of pearls he got
    only the sea-shell. He does not say that observers should except it
    as a pearl or it should sell as such. It is a different matter that
    Allah who watches the endeavours may price it at half so that the
    endeavour does not go waste, nor his passion discouraged.\
    If the theory of correctness is adopted then every verdict on law
    and every opinion shall have to be accepted as correct as Maybudhi
    has written in Fawatih: In this matter the view adopted by
    al-Ash\`ari is right. It follows that differing opinions should all
    be right. Beware, do not bear a bad idea about jurists and do not
    open your tongue to abuse them.\
    When contrary theories and divergent views are accepted as correct
    it is strange why the action of some conspicuous individuals are
    explained as mistakes of decision, since mistake of decision by the
    mujtahid cannot be imagined at all. If the theory of correctness is
    right the action of Mu\`awiyah and \`A\'ishah should be deemed
    right; but if their actions can be deemed to be wrong then we should
    agree that ijtihad can also go wrong, and that the theory of
    correctness is wrong. It will then remain to be decided in its own
    context whether feminism did not impede the decision of \`A\'ishah
    or whether it was a (wrong) finding of Mu\`awiyah or something else.
    However, this theory of correctness was propounded in order to cover
    mistakes and to give them the garb of Allah\'s orders so that there
    should be no impediment in achieving objectives nor should anyone be
    able to speak against any misdeeds.\
    In this sermon Amir al-mu\'minin has referred to those people who
    deviate from the path of Allah and, closing their eyes to light,
    grope in the darkness of imagination, make Faith the victim of their
    views and opinions, pronounce new findings, pass orders by their own
    imagination and produce divergent results. Then on the basis of the
    theory of correctness they regard all these divergent and contrary
    orders as from Allah, as though each of their order represents
    divine Revelation so that no order of theirs can be wrong nor can
    they stumble on any occasion. Thus, Amir al-mu\'minin says in
    disproving this view that:\
    1) When Allah is One, Book (Qur\'an) is one, and Prophet is one then
    the religion (that is followed) should also be one. And when the
    religion is one how can there be divergent orders about any matter,
    because there can be divergence in an order only in case he who
    passed the order has forgotten it, or is oblivious, or senselessness
    overtakes him, or he wilfully desires entanglement in these
    labyrinths, while Allah and the Prophet are above these things.
    These divergences cannot therefore be attributed to them. These
    divergences are rather the outcome of the thinkings and opinions of
    people who are bent on twisting the delineations of religion by
    their own imaginative performances.\
    2) Allah must have either forbidden these divergences or ordered
    creating them. If He has ordered in their favour, where is that
    order and at what place? As for forbidding, the Qur\'an says:\
    . . .Say thou! \'Hath Allah permitted you or ye forge a lie against
    Allah ?\' (10:59)\
    That is, everything that is not in accordance with the Divine orders
    is a concoction, and concoction is forbidden and prohibited. For
    concocters, in the next world, there is neither success or
    achievement nor prosperity and good. Thus, Allah says:\
    And utter ye not whatever lie describe your tongues (saying): This
    is lawful and this is forbidden, to forge a lie against Allah;
    verily, those who forge a lie against Allah succeed not. (Qur\'an,
    16:116)\
    3) If Allah has left religion incomplete and the reason for leaving
    it halfway\
    was that He desired that the people should assist Him in completing
    the religious code and share with Him in the task of legislating,
    then this belief is obviously polytheism. If He sent down the
    religion in complete form the Prophet must have failed in conveying
    it so that room was left for others to apply imagination and
    opinion. This, Allah forbid, would mean a weakness of the Prophet
    and a bad slur on the selection of Allah.\
    4) Allah has said in the Qur\'an that He has not left out anything
    in the Book and has clarified each and every matter. Now, if an
    order is carved out in conflict with the Qur\'an it would be outside
    the religious code and its basis would not be on knowledge and
    perception, or Qur\'an and sunnah, but it would be personal opinion
    and one\'s personal judgement which cannot be deemed to have accord
    with religion and faith.\
    5) Qur\'an is the basis and source of religion and the fountain head
    of the laws of shari\`ah. If the laws of shari\`ah were divergent
    there should have been divergence in it also, and if there were
    divergences in it, it could not be regarded as Divine word. When it
    is Divine word the laws of shari\`ah cannot be divergent, so as to
    accept all divergent and contrary views as correct and imaginative
    verdicts taken as Qur\'anic dictates.]
