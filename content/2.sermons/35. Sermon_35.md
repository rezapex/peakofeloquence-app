*Amir al-mu'minin said after Arbitration.*

> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام)

> بعد التحكيم وما بلغه من أمر الحكمين

> وفيها حمد الله على بلائه، ثمّ بيان سبب البلوى

All praise is due to Allah even though time has brought (for us)
crushing calamity and great occurrence. And I stand witness that there
is no god but Allah the One, there is no partner for Him nor is there
with Him any god other than Himself, and that Muhammad is His slave and
His Prophet (May Allah's blessing and greeting be upon him and his
progeny).

> الْحَمْدُ للهِ وَإنْ أَتَى الدَّهْرُ بِالْخَطْبِ الْفَادِحِ وَالْحَدَثِ الْجَلِيلِ، وَأَشْهَدُ أَنْ لاَ إِلهَ
> إِلاّ اللهُ، لَيْسَ مَعَهُ إِلهٌ غَيْرُهُ، وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ صلى الله عليه وآله .

So now, certainly the disobedience of sympathetic counsellor who has
knowledge as well as experience brings about disappointment and result
in repentance. I had given you my orders about this arbitration and put
before you my hidden view, if
Qasir's orders were fulfilled but you rejected it (my orders)
like rough opponents and disobedient insurgents till the counsellor
himself fell in doubt about his counsel and the flint (of his wit)
ceased to give flame. Consequently, mine and your position became as the
poet of Hawazin says:

*I gave you my orders at Mun'araji'l-liwa but you did not see the good
of my counsel till the noon of next day (when it was too late)*

*.*

> مَّا بَعْدُ، فَإِنَّ مَعْصِيَةَ النَّاصِحِ الشَّفِيقِ الْعَالِمِ الُْمجَرِّبِ تُورِثُ الْحَسْرَةَ، وَتُعْقِبُ
> النَّدَامَةَ، وَقَدْ كُنْتُ أَمَرْتُكُمْ في هذِهِ الْحُكُومَةِ أَمْرِي، وَنَخَلْتُ لَكُمْ مَخزُونَ رَأْيِي لَوْ
> كَانَ يُطَاعُ لِقَصِيرٍأَمْرٌ! فَأَبَيْتُمْ عَلَيَّ إِبَاءَ الُْمخَالِفِينَ الْجُفَاةِ، وَالمُنَابِذِينَ
> الْعُصَاةِ، حَتَّى ارْتَابَ النَّاصِحُ بِنُصْحِهِ، وَضَنَّ الزَّنْدُ بِقَدْحِهِچ، فَكُنْتُ وَإِيَّاكُمْ كَمَا قَالَ
> أَخُو

> هَوَازِنَ:

> أَمَرْتُكُمُ أَمْري بِمُنْعَرَجِ اللِّوَى فَلَمْ تَسْتَبِينُوا النُّصْحَ إِلاَّ ضُحَى الْغَدِ

-  When the
    Syrians\' spirit was broken by the bloody swords of the Iraqis, and
    the incessant attacks of the night of al-Harir lowered their morale
    and ended their aspirations \`Amr ibn al-\`As suggested to
    Mu\`awiyah the trick that the Qur\'an should be raised on spears and
    shouts urged forth to treat it as the arbitrator. Its effect would
    be that some people would try to stop the war and others would like
    to continue it. We would thus divide them and be able to get the war
    postponed for another occasion. Consequently, copies of the Qur\'an
    were raised on spears. The result was that some brainless persons
    raised hue and cry and created division and disturbance in the army
    and the efforts of simple Muslims turned slow after having been near
    victory. Without understanding anything they began to shout that
    they should prefer the verdict of the Qur\'an over war.\
    When Amir al-mu\'minin saw the Qur\'an being the instrument of their
    activities, he said:\
    \"O people do not fall in this trap of deceit and trickery. They are
    putting up this device only to escape the ignominy of defeat. I know
    the character of each one of them. They are neither adherents of the
    Qur\'an nor have they any connection with the faith or religion. The
    very purpose of our fighting has been that they should follow the
    Qur\'an and act on its injunctions. For Allah\'s sake do not fall in
    their deceitful device. Go ahead with determination and courage and
    stop only after vanquishing the dying foe.\" Nevertheless, the
    deceitful instrument of wrong had worked. The people took to
    disobedience and rebellion. Mis\`ar ibn Fadaki at-Tamimi and Zayd
    ibn Husayn at-Ta\'i each with twenty thousand men came forward and
    said to Amir al-mu\'minin, \'O\' \`Ali, if you do not respond to the
    call of the Qur\'an we will deal with you in the same manner as we
    did with \`Uthman. You end the battle at once and bow before the
    verdict of the Qur\'an. Amir al-mu\'minin tried his best to make
    them understand but Satan was standing before them in the garb of
    the Qur\'an. He did not allow them to do so, and they compelled Amir
    al-mu\'minin that he should send someone to call Malik ibn al-Harith
    al-Ashtar from the battlefield. Being obliged, Amir al-mu\'minin
    sent Yazid ibn Hani to call Malik back. When Malik heard this order
    he was bewildered and said, \"Please tell him this is not the
    occasion to leave the position. He may wait a bit then I will come
    to his audience with the tidings of victory.\" Hani conveyed this
    message on return but people shouted that Amir al-mu\'minin must
    have sent word to him secretly to continue. Amir al-mu\'minin said
    he never got any occasion to send any secret message to him.
    Whatever he said was said before them. People said he should be sent
    again and that if Malik delayed his return Amir al-mu\'minin should
    forsake his life. Amir al-mu\'minin again sent Yazid ibn Hani and
    sent word that rebellion had occurred, he should return in whatever
    condition he was. So Hani went and told Malik \"You hold victory
    dear or the life of Amir al-mu\'minin. If his life is dear you
    should raise hands off the battle and go to him.\" Leaving the
    chances of victory Malik stood up and came to the audience of Amir
    al-mu\'minin with grief and disappointment. Chaos raged there. He
    rebuked the people very much but matters had taken such a turn that
    could not be corrected.\
    It was then settled that either party should nominate an arbitrator
    so that they should settle the (matter of) Caliphate according to
    the Qur\'an. From Mu\`awiyah\'s side \`Amr ibn al-\`As was decided
    upon and from Amir al mu\'minin\'s side people proposed the name of
    Abu Musa al-Ash\`ari. Seeing this wrong selection Amir al-mu\'minin
    said, \"Since you have not accepted my order about arbitration at
    least now agree that do not make Abu Musa the arbitrator. He is not
    a man of trust. Here is \`Abdullah ibn \`Abbas and here is Malik
    al-Ashtar. Select one of them.\" But they did not at all listen to
    him and stuck to his name. Amir al-mu\'minin said, \"All right, do
    whatever you want. The day is not far when you will cut your own
    hands through your misdeeds.\"\
    After the nomination of arbitrators when the deed of agreement was
    being written, then with \`Ali ibn Abi Talib (p.b.u.h.) the word
    Amir al-mu\'minin was also written. \`Amr ibn al-\`As said, \"This
    should be rubbed off. If we regarded him Amir al-mu\'minin why
    should this battle have been fought?\" At first Amir al-mu\'minin
    refused to rub it off but when they did not in any way agree, he
    rubbed it off and said, \"This incident is just similar to the one
    at al-Hudaybiyah when the unbelievers stuck on the point that the
    words \'Prophet of Allah\' with the name of the Prophet should be
    removed and the Prophet did remove it.\" On this \`Amr ibn al-\`As
    got angry and said, \"Do you treat us as unbelievers?\" Amir
    al-mu\'minin said, \"On what day have you had anything to do with
    believers and when have you been their supporters?\" However, after
    this settlement, the people dispersed, and after mutual consultation
    these two arbitrators decided that by removing both \`Ali and
    Mu\`awiyah from the Caliphate the people should be accorded the
    power to choose whomever they desired. When time came to its
    announcement there was a meeting at Dumatu\'l-Jandal, a place
    between Iraq and Syria, and then two arbitrators also reached there
    to announce the judgement on the fate of the Muslims. Acting
    cunningly \`Amr ibn al-\`As said to Abu Musa, \"I regard it ill
    manner to precede you. You are older in years and age so first you
    make the announcement.\" Abu Musa succumbed to his flattery and came
    out proudly and stood before the gathering. Addressing them he said,
    \"O\' Muslims we have jointly settled that \`Ali ibn Abi Talib and
    Mu\`awiyah should be removed and the right to choose a Caliph be
    accorded to the Muslims. They should choose whomever they like.\"
    Saying this he sat down. Now the turn was for \`Amr ibn al-\`As and
    he said, \"O\' Muslims you have heard that Abu Musa removed \`Ali
    ibn Abi Talib. I also agree with it. As for Mu\`awiyah, there is no
    question of removing him. Therefore I place him in his position.\"
    No sooner that he said this there were cries all round. Abu Musa
    cried hoarse that it was a trick, a deceit and told \`Amr ibn
    al-\`As that, \"You have played a trick, and your example is that of
    a dog on which if you load something he would gasp, or leave him he
    would gasp.\" \`Amr ibn al-\`As said, \"Your example is like the ass
    on whom books are loaded.\" However \`Amr ibn al-\`As\'s trick was
    effective and Mu\`awiyah\'s shaking feet were again stabilised. This
    was the short sketch of the Arbitration whose basis was laid in the
    Qur\'an and sunnah. But was it a verdict of the Qur\'an or the
    result of those deceitful contrivances which people of this world
    employ to retain their authority? Could these pages of history be
    made a torch-guide for the future and the Qur\'an and sunnah be not
    used as a means of securing authority or as an instrument of worldly
    benefits.\
    When Amir al-mu\'minin got the news of this lamentable result of
    arbitration, he climbed on the pulpit and delivered this sermon
    every word of which savours of his grief and sorrow and at the same
    time it throws light on soundness of his thinking, correctness of
    his opinion and foresighted sagacity.]
-  This is a proverb
    which is used on an occasion where the advice of a counsellor is
    rejected and afterwards it is repented. The fact of it was that the
    ruler of al-Hirah namely Jadhimah al-Abrash killed the ruler of
    al-Jazirah named \`Amr ibn Zarib whereafter his daughter az-Zabba\'
    was made the ruler of al-Jazirah. Soon after accession to the throne
    she thought out this plan to avenge her father\'s blood, that she
    sent a message to Jadhimah that she could not alone carry on the
    affairs of the state and that if he could become her patron by
    accepting her as his wife she would be grateful. Jadhimah was more
    than puffed up at this proposal, and prepared himself to set off for
    al-Jazirah with a thousand horsemen. His slave Qasir advised him
    much that this was just a deceit and trick and that he should not
    place himself in this danger; but his wit had been so blinded that
    he could not think over why az-Zabba\' should select the Murderer of
    her father for her life companionship. Anyhow, he set off and when
    he reached the border of al-Jazirah although az-Zabba\'s army was
    present for his reception but she neither gave any special reception
    nor offered any warm welcome. Seeing this state Qasir was again
    suspicious and he advised Jadhimah to get back, but nearness to the
    goal had further fanned his passion. He paid no heed and stepping
    further entered the city. Soon on arrival there he was killed. When
    Qasir saw this he said, \"Had the advice of Qasir been followed.\"
    From that time this proverb gained
    currency.]
-  The poet of
    Hawazin implies Durayd ibn as-Simmah. He wrote this couplet after
    the death of his brother \`Abdullah ibn as-Simmah. Its facts are
    that \`Abdullah along with his brother led an attack of two groups
    of Banu Jusham and Bani Nasr who were both from Hawazin, and drove
    away many camels. On return when they intended to rest at
    Mun\`araji\'l-liwa, Durayd said it was not advisable to stay there
    lest the enemy attacks from behind, but \`Abdullah did not agree and
    stayed there. The result was that as soon as dawn appeared the enemy
    attacked and killed \`Abdullah on the spot. Durayd also received
    wounds but he slipped away alive, and after this he wrote a few
    couplets out of which one couplet is this wherein he has referred to
    the destruction resulting from his advice having been
    rejected.]
