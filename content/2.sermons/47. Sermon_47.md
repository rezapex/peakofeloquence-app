*About calamities befalling Kufah*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> في ذكر الكوفة

O Kufah, as though I see you being drawn like the tanned leather of
'Ukazi{#epub.html_fref_772a0bf0_1
.see-footnote} in the market, you are being scraped by calamities and
being ridden by severe troubles. I
certainly{#epub.html_fref_a381d2b2_2
.see-footnote} know that if any tyrant intends evil for you Allah will
afflict him with worry and fling him with a killer (set someone on him
to kill him).

> كَأَنَّي بِكِ يَاكُوفَةُ تُمَدِّينَ مَدَّ الاْدَيمِ الْعُكَاظِيِّ، تُعْرَكِينَ بِالنَّوَازِلِ، وَتُرْكَبِينَ
> بِالزَّلاَزِلِ، وَإِنَّي لاَعْلَمُ أَنَّهُ مَاأَرَادَ بِكِ جَبَّارٌ سُوءاً إِلاَّ ابْتَلاَهُ اللهُ بِشَاغِل،
> وَرَمَاهُ بِقَاتِل!

-  During
    pre-Islamic days a market used to be organised every year near
    Mecca. Its name was \`Ukaz where mostly hides were traded as a
    result of which leather was attributed to it. Besides sale and
    purchase literary meetings were also arranged and Arabs used to
    attract admiration by reciting their works. After Islam, because of
    the better congregation in the shape of hajj this market went
    down.]
-  This prophecy of
    Amir al-mu\'minin was fulfilled word by word and the world saw how
    the people who had committed tyranny and oppression on the strength
    of their masterly power had to face tragic end and what ways of
    their destruction were engendered by their blood-shedding and
    homicidal activities. Consequently, the end of Ziyad ibn Abih (son
    of unknown father) was that when he intended to deliver a speech for
    vilification of Amir al-mu\'minin suddenly paralysis overtook him
    and he could not get out of his bed thereafter. The end of the
    bloodshed perpetrated by \`Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad was that he fell a
    prey to leprosy and eventually blood thirsty swords put him to
    death. The ferocity of al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath-Thaqafi drove him to
    the fate that snakes cropped up in his stomach as a result of which
    he died after severe pain. \`Umar ibn Hubayrah al-Fazari died of
    leucoderma. Khalid ibn \`Abdillah al-Qasri suffered the hardships of
    prison and was killed in a very bad way. Mus\`ab ibn az-Zubayr and
    Yazid ibn al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufrah were also killed by
    swords.]
