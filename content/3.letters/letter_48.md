After glorifying Allah and praising the Holy Prophet (s) let it be known to you that I trusted 
you and appointed you on a very responsible post. I did this under the impression that from 
my own clan nobody will prove more sympathetic, more helpful and more trustworthy to me 
than you. 
But when you found that the times have gone against your cousin, his enemies are on the war 
path, wealth of the country is being recklessly plundered, the nation has lost sight of the true 
path of religion and it is confused and confounded, then you have also changed colour. You 
have forsaken your cousin, you left him along with other deserters and by joining the gang of 
dishonest persons, you have also betrayed the trust I reposed in you. 
You have changed so much that you have not only lost the sense of sympathy for your cousin 
but you have also lost the sense of honesty and virtue. 
Your present behaviour indicates that you have never been sincere, as if your participating in 
jihad (the Holy Wars) was not in the cause of Allah and as if the true light of religion had 
never illuminated the dark recesses of your mind. Along with the majority, you had also 
participated in jihad to amass wealth under the pretence of serving Allah and religion and 
awaited opportunities to decamp with wealth of the Islamic State. And when the opportunity 
presented itself to you to be dishonest to your heart's content and when you found your ruler 
seriously engaged somewhere else you jumped at the evil chance, you invaded the Public 
Treasury and looted as much as was possible for you, the money which was reserved for 
widows, orphans and the poor. 
In this plunder your action was so quick, so nimble and so effective that it resembled the 
action of a very active and wary wolf attacking and snatching away a wounded and helpless 
goat. 
You have with pleasure sent this looted wealth to Hijaz. 
The sin pleased you and the loot made you happy. The thought that it was an evil deed never 
stopped you from the act. Did you take it for a heritage which you can take hold of and send 
home? Allahu Akbar! Do you not believe in the Day of Judgement? Are you not afraid of the 
reckoning on that Day? 
O you whom we took for a wise and intelligent person! How can you happily and with easy 
conscience eat and drink things purchased by this wealth being aware all the time of its 
unlawfulness. Do you realise the enormity of your sin? Out of the money which was 
earmarked for the use of orphans, paupers and the destitute or which was reserved for faithful 
Muslims and Mujahids or was conserved for the defence of the Muslims State, you provided 
for yourself means of your enjoyments and pleasures, you purchased slave-girls out of it and 
you spent it on your marriages. 
I advise you to fear Allah and return the money to those whom it rightfully belongs. 
If you do not do this and if Allah gives me a chance to punish you then I shall act in such a 
way that Allah will be pleased with me. I shall give you a stroke with that sword of mine 
which has sent all those whom I struck with it, to Hell. I swear by the Merciful Allah that 
even if all the wealth which you have so wickedly looted had come into my possession in a 
lawful way it would not have pleased me to leave it to my heir as a heirloom. 
Control your inordinate desires, think well over what you have done and remember that you 
have reached the mature age, just try to visualize that death has brought an end to your life, 
you are lying in a grave with so much earth over you and your deeds are placed before you. 
What would you say and do at such a time and place, a place where tyrants and oppressors 
could only repent and wish to go back to the world they left behind but there will be no 
escape from the punishment.
