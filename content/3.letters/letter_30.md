description: When Imam Ali (a) appointed Muhammad bin Abu Bakr as the Governor of Egypt, he gave him the following instructions.
---

Treat them (the Egyptians) with respect. Be kind and considerate with them. Meet them 
cheerfully. Be fair, just and impartial in your dealings so that even the influential persons may 
not dare take undue advantage of your leniency and the commoners and the poor may not be 
disappointed in your justice and fair dealings. 
O creature of Allah! Remember that the Almighty Lord is going to take an account of 
everyone of your sins, major or minor and whether committed openly or secretly. 
If He punishes you for your sins, it will not be an act of tyranny and if He forgives you it will 
be because of His Great Mercy and Forgiveness. 
O creature of Allah! Remember that pious persons passed away from this world after having 
led a respectable and fruitful life and they are going to be well-rewarded in the next world 
(when compared with the worldly-minded people they had equal opportunities of gathering 
fruits of this world and utilized them to the best of their abilities and at the same time kept 
away from all wicked and vicious ways of life). They did not jeopardize their salvation like 
worldly-minded persons. They led a more contented, more respectable and happier life than 
those who lived wickedly. 
They enjoyed the fruits of their labours and they had more gratifying, sober and healthy 
experience of the pleasures of life than the rich and the wealthy. They regaled themselves 
with the joys, the facilities and the bliss of this world as much as the tyrant and vicious people 
desired to enjoy. 
Yet while leaving this world they carried with them all that would be of use to them in the 
next world. While living in this world they enjoyed the happiness of relinquishing its evil 
ways. 
They made themselves sure that in the life to come they will be recipient of His Grace and 
Blessings, their requests will not be turned down and the favours destined for them in 
Paradise will not be lessened or reduced. 
O creature of Allah! Fear the inevitable and unavoidable death which is so near to everybody. 
Be prepared to meet it. Verily, it will come as the most important and the greatest event of 
your life; it will either carry unmixed blessings and rewards for you or it will bring in its wake 
punishments, sufferings, and eternal damnation. There will be no chance of its lessening or 
redemption or any change for the better. 
It is for you to decide whether to proceed towards perpetual peace and blessings - Paradise, or 
towards eternal damnation - the Hell. Remember that life is actually driving you towards 
death which will meet you if you are ready to face it and which will follow you like a shadow 
if you try to run away from it. 
Death is with you as if it has been twisted and tied round your head in between your hair and 
life is being rolled away from behind you with each exhalation of your breath, never to be 
unrolled. 
Be afraid of the fire - the Hell, whose depth is fathomless whose intensity is enormous and 
where new kinds of punishments are constantly being introduced. The Hell is an abode where 
there is no place for His Mercy and Blessings. 
Prayers of those who are thrown there will neither be heard nor accepted and there will not be 
any lessening in their sufferings and sorrows. 
If it is possible for you to be sincerely afraid of Allah as well as have sincere faith in His 
Justice, Mercy and Love of His creatures, then try to hold these two beliefs firmly because a 
man entertains and cherishes the love, reverence and veneration of Allah in proportion to His 
fear and awe that develops in his mind. 
Verily, among men he who fully believes in His Justice and is afraid of it, as well as likes it 
expects the best rewards from Allah. 
O Muhammad, son of Abu Bakr! Remember that I have entrusted you with the command of 
the most important section of my army which is Egyptian. Do not allow your whims and 
passions to overrun your judgement. Keep on guarding and defending your religion and the 
State given under your trust. Take care that not for a single moment in your life, you incur the 
Wrath of Allah, to gain the pleasure of any person. 
Remember that the Pleasure of Allah can substitute the pleasure of everybody else and it will 
be the most beneficial substitute for you but His Pleasure cannot be substituted by anything. 
Offer your prayers on time, do not rush through them, and never delay in offering them. 
Remember that piety and nobleness of all your activities are subject to sincerity and 
punctuality of your prayers. 
Remember that a true Imam and leader cannot be equal to the one who leads humanity 
towards wickedness and vice and eventually towards Hell nor can there be an equality 
between a follower of the Holy Prophet (s) and his sworn enemy. 
Remember the Holy Prophet (s) said that so far as his followers are concerned he was not 
afraid of encroachments upon any true Muslim by a heathen because Allah will protect every 
true Muslim from evil deeds on account of the sincerity of his faith and He will expose and 
avert the evils introduced by heathens, but he (the Holy Prophet (s)) felt anxious about the 
activities of hypocrites among Muslims, activities of those outwardly wise and learned people 
who loudly proclaimed greatness and virtues of their good deeds but who secretly indulged in 
vices and sins.
