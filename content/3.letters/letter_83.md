description: A letter to Mu'awiya.

I have become sick of reading your letters and of replying to them. I feel that I have made an 
error in giving them undue importance and taking them seriously. 
You are always unreasonable and often irrational. Your sole desire is to make me accept your 
demand (for allowing your oppressive, tyrannical and apostatic sway over a big province) and 
for this you have carried on an unending series of correspondence. 
Your condition is like that of a man who wants to live in a land of happy dreams and does not 
want to face facts or like the one who is confused and who does not know what to do and 
where to go and who is unaware of what the future (life after death) has in store for him. 
I know that you are not a fool but you resemble foolish and unreasonable people. 
I swear by Allah that had I not been disinclined to bring harm to you I would have taken the 
initiative and would have punished you very severely. Beware that Satan has made you 
incorrigible, it has made you blind to good things as shown by the Holy Prophet (s) and deaf 
to his teachings. 
May the Peace of Allah be upon those who deserve it.
