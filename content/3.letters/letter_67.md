description: While leaving Madina for Basra, Imam Ali (a) wrote the following letter to the people of Kufa. It is a wonderful epistle. It invites people to judge his intentions and actions.

After glorifying Allah and praising the Holy Prophet (s) let it be known to you that I am 
leaving this city either as an oppressor or oppressed, either I am revolting against the people 
or some of them have conspired to revolt against the people or against me. Whatever the case 
may be I invite in the Name of Allah those to whom this letter reaches, to come and see for 
themselves whether I am in the right or on the wrong. If they find me on the path of truth and 
justice they may help me and if they find that I am on the wrong then they can reason me out 
of it.
