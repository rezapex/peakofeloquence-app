description: A letter to Mu'awiya.

Allahu Akbar! How hopelessly you are engulfed in your inordinate and sinful desires, how 
mercilessly you are swept by such vicious and unholy cravings which misguide you in this 
life and will bring you to a sad end. You have forsaken the cause of truth and justice and have 
arrogantly spurned the arguments which are agreeable to Allah and were unacceptable to man. 
What do you mean by creating this faction and revolt with pretence of taking revenge on the 
murderers of Uthman? 
The real facts of the case are that during the life of Caliph Uthman, you only went to his help 
when this action in the end was profitable to you and you could get something out of him, and 
you refused to help him when he was really in need of you and your support and for which he 
had frequently requested you.
