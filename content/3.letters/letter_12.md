description: Part of instructions to his marshal when Imam Ali (a) sent him to a battle.

When you approach an enemy or when he approaches you, make it a point to keep your army 
on a hilltop or at the foot of a mountain or on the side of a river so that you easily watch the 
movements of your enemy. Do not involve the whole army in the encounter, allow only a few 
units to take part in the engagements. If your army is not on a hilltop then post your scouts 
and guards on high vantage points and along the line of fortification so that the enemy may 
not take you unawares. 
Remember that the commanders of an army are its guardians and the eyes of these 
commanders are the scouts. 
Try to avoid dissensions and do not cause superiority or inferiority complexes to take root 
among your officers and in your ranks. Wherever and whenever you camp, make it a point 
that all of your officers and soldiers camp in the same locality and are provided with the same 
comforts and conveniences and whenever you march, always march in company formation. If 
you want to rest during the night draw a circular formation of your lancers round your army 
and do not let sound sleep overpower you.
