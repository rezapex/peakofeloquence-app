title: Letter 14
description: Instructions to two of his commanders.
---

I have appointed Malik bin Harith as chief of the staff over you and the armies under you. 
Take your orders from him and obey him. Treat him as if he is your shield and armour 
because there is no risk of laziness or lethargy from him, nor of nervousness and blunders nor 
of any error of commission and omission.
