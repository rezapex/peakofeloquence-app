description: The following is a circular-letter sent to those governors and State officers, through whose territory the armies of Imam Ali (a) were to pass.

From the creature of Allah Ali bin Abi Taalib (a) to the governors and the collectors of those 
provinces through which his armies are to pass. 
After glorifying Allah and praising the Holy Prophet (s), be it known to you that I am sending 
some detachments of army which will, Allah willing shortly pass through your cities and 
provinces. 
I have issued them the orders which Allah wants them to obey: They should not molest 
anybody or harm any person or anything. I want to inform you and your subjects that if the 
soldiers misbehave themselves or if they take anything, their action is against my orders. 
Except for the condition that they accidentally fall short of the ration and can find no way to 
appease their appetite, if they take anything from anybody they are to be punished. 
You may punish them. But take care and do not allow the foolish and insolent people of your 
place to quarrel with them or insult them or interfere with or obstruct the things that I have 
permitted them. I shall also be following the army. 
You may report to me of any excess or violence committed within your jurisdiction, of any 
awkward and difficult position in which you find yourself, or of any harshness or atrocity 
which was perpetrated in your province and which you cannot redeem without the help of 
Allah and your Imam. If you report all such affairs to me, Allah willing I shall attend to them 
and settle them to the satisfaction of all.
