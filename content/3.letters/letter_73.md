description: Abdullah bin Qays, better known in history as Abu Musa Ash'ari, was a man with weak faith, more inclined to look after his worldly interest than the cause of religion. At the beginning of the Caliphat...

From the creature of Allah, Ali bin Abi Taalib to Abdullah bin Qays (Abu Musa Ash'ari). 
After glorifying Allah and praising the Holy Prophet (s) let it be known to you that I have 
received reports which may be considered favourable to you, and yet at the same time may be 
deemed against you (that you on one hand declare me to be a lawful caliph and in the same 
breath you persuade others not to come to my help). 
As soon as my messenger reaches you, get ready, come out of your retreat, invite your people 
to join me and come yourself. If you are convinced that I am on the right side, then you must 
come to my help and if you feel uncertain, nervous or timid, then get you gone. 
I swear by Allah that I shall not let you waver or adopt a double-cross policy. I shall not allow 
you to sit peacefully at home with a double face, one for each party and I shall expose you to 
the people. You will find yourself under suspicion from either group and you will be forced to 
declare your true inclinations. 
This revolt which has made Basra as its Headquarters is not an easy joke as you have 
imagined it to be. It is a great tragedy and it shall have very far-reaching effects. It has to be 
faced with the calamities which accompany it or which will follow it. It will have to be fought 
and to get the better of. Therefore, I advise you to think carefully, control your weak and 
wavering mind and face your lot bravely. 
And if you are not satisfied with me or have no faith in me then you can with complete 
freedom go to the other side. 
You have my unreserved permission. But I am sure you will not be welcomed there. 
And if you remain in my camp I shall not allow you to enjoy a restful sleep when Islam itself 
is in troubles and at war with the rebels. I swear by Allah that this decision of mine is the right 
step of a faithful Muslim in the right direction.
