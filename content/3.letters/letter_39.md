title: Letter 39
description: A letter to Mu'awiya.
---

You have misguided the whole generation of men around you. Having no faith in the truth of 
Islam you have led others astray. You have thrown them in the depths of ignorance. You have 
enticed them towards the abyss for unenlightenment and illiteracy. They were out to reach 
truth but they cannot reach it now, because of you. They have lost the true path of religion. 
They are becoming sceptics and most of them are returning to infidelity of pre-Islamic days. 
Theirs is an unfortunate plight. A few wise men from amongst them who have seen your ways 
and who realized the intensity of your viciousness and your cunningness in turning them 
away from the ways of Islam, have given you up and have turned towards Allah. They are 
fortunate and may be blessed. 
O Mu'awiya! Fear Allah, do not let the Devil lead you to Hell, throw away its yoke which is 
tied round your neck, remember that this life will after all come to an end and soon you will 
have to face the next world.
