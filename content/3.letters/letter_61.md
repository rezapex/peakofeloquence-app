IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE BENEFICENT, THE MERCIFUL. 
These are the orders issued by the creature of Allah, Ali, the son Abu Taalib (a) to Maalik, the 
son of Ashtar when he appointed Maalik as the Governor of Egypt to collect Zakat there, to 
combat the enemies of Islam and Egypt, to work for the welfare of its people and to look after 
its prosperity. 
I order you, Maalik, always to keep the fear of Allah in your mind, to give priority to His 
worship and to give preference to obeying His Commands over every other thing in life, to 
carefully and faithfully follow the commandments and interdictions as are given by the Holy 
Book and the traditions of the Holy Prophet (s) because the success of a man to attain 
happiness in this world and in the next depends upon these qualities, and a failure to achieve 
these attributes brings about total failure in both the worlds. 
I order you to use your head, heart, hands and tongue to help the creatures of Allah because 
the Almighty Allah holds Himself responsible to help those who sincerely try their best to 
help Him. Allah has further ordered you to keep your desires under control, to keep yourself 
under restraint when extravagant and inordinate yearnings and cravings try to drive you 
towards vice and wickedness because usually your 'self' tries to incite and drag you towards 
infamy and damnation unless the Merciful Lord comes to your help. 
Let it be known to you, Maalik, that I am sending you as a governor to a country which has 
seen many regimes before this. Some of them were benign, sympathetic and good, while 
others were tyrannical, oppressive and cruel. People will judge your regime as critically as 
you have studied the activities of other regimes and they will criticize you in the same way as 
you have censured or approved other rulers. 
You must know that a good and virtuous man is known and recognized by the good that is 
said about him and the praise which Allah has destined him to receive from others. 
Therefore, make your mind the source and fountain-head of good thoughts, good intentions 
and good deeds. This can only be attained by keeping a strict control on your desires and 
yearnings, however much they may try to incite and coerce you. Remember that the best way 
to do justice to your inner self and to keep it out of harm is to restrain it from vice and from 
things which the 'self' inordinately and irrationally desires. 
Maalik! You must create in your mind kindness, compassion and love for your subjects. Do 
not behave towards them as if you are a voracious and ravenous beast and as if your success 
lies in devouring them. 
Remember, Maalik, that amongst your subjects there are two kinds of people: those who have 
the same religion as you have; they are brothers to you, and those who have religions other 
than that of yours, they are human beings like you. Men of either category suffer from the 
same weaknesses and disabilities that human beings are inclined to, they commit sins, indulge 
in vices either intentionally or foolishly and unintentionally without realizing the enormity of 
their deeds. Let your mercy and compassion come to their rescue and help in the same way 
and to the same extent that you expect Allah to show mercy and forgiveness to you. 
Maalik! You must never forget that if you are a ruler over them than the caliph is the ruler 
over you and Allah is the Supreme Lord over the caliph. And the reality is that He has 
appointed you as the governor and tested you through the responsibility of this rulership over 
them. 
Never think of raising yourself to such a false prestige that you can declare war against Allah 
because you cannot ward off His Wrath and you can never be free from the need of His 
Mercy and Compassion. 
Do not feel ashamed to forgive and forget. Do not hurry over punishments and do not be 
pleased and do not be proud of your power to punish. Do not get angry and lose your temper 
quickly over the mistakes and failures of those over whom you rule. 
On the contrary, be patient and sympathetic with them. Anger and desire of vengeance are not 
going to be of much help to you in your administration. 
Never say to yourself, "I am their Lord, their ruler and all in all over them and that I must be 
obeyed submissively and humbly" because such a thought will unbalance your mind, will 
make you vain and arrogant, will weaken your faith in religion and will make you seek 
support of any power other than that of Allah . If you ever feel any pride or vanity on account 
of your sway and rule over your subjects then think of the supreme sway and rule of the Lord 
over the Universe, the extent of His creations, the supremacy of His Might and Glory, His 
Power to do things which you cannot even dream of doing and His control over you which is 
more dominating than that which you can ever achieve over anything around you. Such 
thoughts will cure your mental weakness, will keep you away from vanity and rebellion 
(against Allah), will reduce your arrogance and haughtiness and will take you back to the 
sanity which you had foolishly deserted. 
Take care never to think of bringing yourself at par with Allah, never to think of matching 
your power with Him and contesting His Glory and ever to pretend that you possess might 
and power like Him because the Mighty Lord will always humble pitiless tyrants and will 
degrade all pretenders of His Power and Might. 
So far as your own affairs or those of your relatives and friends are concerned take care that 
you do not violate the duties laid down upon you by Allah and do not usurp the rights of 
mankind, be impartial and do justice to them because if you give up equity and justice then 
you will certainly be a tyrant and an oppressor. And whoever tyrannizes and oppresses the 
creatures of Allah, will earn enmity of Allah along with the hatred of those whom he has 
oppressed; and whoever earns the Wrath of Allah loses all chances of salvation and he has no 
excuse to offer on the Day of Judgement. 
Every tyrant and oppressor is an enemy of Allah unless he repents and gives up oppression. 
Remember, Maalik! that there is nothing in this world more effective to turn His Blessings 
into His Wrath quicker than to insist upon oppression over His creatures because the Merciful 
Allah will always hear the prayers of those who have been oppressed and He will give no 
chance to oppressors. 
You must always appreciate and adopt a policy which is neither too severe nor too lenient, a 
policy which is based upon equity will be largely appreciated. Remember that the displeasure 
of common men, the have-nots and the depressed persons more overbalances than the 
approval of important persons, while the displeasure of a few big people will be excused by 
the Lord if the general public and the masses of your subjects are happy with you. 
Remember, Maalik! that usually these big personages are mentally the scum of the human 
society, they are the people who will be the worst drag upon you during your moments of 
peace and happiness, and the least useful to you during your hours of need and adversity, they 
hate justice the most, they will keep on demanding more and more out of the State resources 
and will seldom be satisfied with what they receive and will never be obliged for the favour 
shown to them if their demands are justifiable refused, they will never accept any reasonable 
excuse or any rational argument and when the time changes, you will never find them 
staunch, faithful and loyal. 
While the common men, the poor and apparently the less important section of your subjects 
are the pillars of Islam, they are the real assemblage of Muslims and the power and defensive 
force against the enemies of Islam. Keep your mind on their affairs, be more friendly with 
them and secure their trust and goodwill. 
But be careful in forming your contacts (whether with the most important persons or the 
commoners); keep such people away from you and think them to be the enemy of the State 
who are scandal-mongers and who try to find fault with others and carry on propaganda 
against them because everywhere people have weaknesses and failings and it is the duty of 
the government to overlook (minor) shortcomings. You must not try to go in search of those 
weaknesses which are hidden from you, leave them to Allah, and about those weaknesses 
which come to your notice, you must try to teach them how to overcome them. Try not to 
expose the weaknesses of the people and Allah will conceal your own weaknesses which you 
do not want anybody to know. 
Do not give cause to the people to envy each other (man against man, tribe against tribe or 
one section of the society against the other). Try to alleviate and root out mutual distrust and 
enmity from amongst your subjects. 
Be fair, impartial and just in your dealings with all, individually and collectively and be 
careful not to make your person, position and favours act as sources of malice. Do not let any 
such thing or such person come near to you who does not deserve your nearness and your 
favour. Never lower your dignity and prestige. 
Remember that backbiters and scandal-mongers belong to a mean and cunning group, though 
they pretend to be sincere advisers. Do not make haste to believe the news they bring and do 
not heed to their advice. 
Do not accept the advice of misers, they will try their best to keep you away from acts of 
kindness and from doing good to others. They will make you frightened of poverty. 
Similarly do not allow cowards to act as your advisers because they will make you timid in 
enforcing your orders, will scare you from handling important affairs boldly and will make 
your enterprises and invasions timid and timorous attempts. At the same time avoid greedy 
and covetous persons who would aspire to the position of acting as your counsellor because 
he will teach you how to exploit the community and how to oppress people to get their 
wealth. Remember that miserliness, cowardice and greed appear to be different wicked 
qualities but they all arise from the same evil mentality of having no faith and no trust in 
Allah. 
Your worst ministers will be the men who had been ministers to the despotic rulers before 
you and who had been a party o atrocities committed by them. Such persons should not be 
taken into your confidence and should not be trusted because they have aided sinners and 
have assisted tyrants and cruel rulers. 
In their stead you can comfortably find persons who are equally wise and learned but who 
have not developed sinful and criminal mentalities, who have neither helped the tyrants in 
their tyrannies nor have they assisted them to carry on their sinful deeds. Such persons will 
prove the least troublesome to you. They will be the most helpful. They will sincerely 
sympathise with you. If you take them in your confidence they will sever their connections 
with your opponents. Keep such people with you as your companions in your informal 
company as well as in official gatherings in audience. From amongst such honest and humane 
companions and ministers some would receive your fullest confidence and trust. They are 
those who can always speak out the bitter truth to you and unreservedly and without fear of 
your status, can refuse to assist you or associate with you in the deeds which Allah does not 
like His good creatures to commit. 
Select honest, truthful and pious people as your companions. Train them not to flatter you and 
not to seek your favour by false praises because flattery and false praises create vanity and 
conceit and they make a man lose sight of his real self and ignore his duties. 
You should not treat good and bad people alike because in this way you will be discouraging 
good persons and at the same time emboldening the wicked to carry on their wickedness. 
Everyone should receive the treatment which his deeds make him deserve. 
Try carefully to realize that a ruler can create goodwill in the minds of his subjects and can 
make them faithful and sincere to him only when he is kind and considerate to them, when he 
reduces their troubles, when he does not oppress them and when he never asks for things 
which are beyond their power. 
These are the principles which you should keep in mind and act upon. Let your attitude be 
such that they do not lose faith in you because a good faith on their part will reduce many 
troubles of administration and will relieve you of many worries and anxieties. And so far as 
your confidence and trust is concerned, let it rest with those people whom you have tested in 
difficulties and whom you have befriended, but you should always mistrust those people 
whom you have wronged or who have proved themselves undeserving, inefficient or 
unfaithful. 
Do not give up those practices and do not break those rules which good Muslims have 
evolved or introduced before you, which have created unity and amity among the various 
sections of the society and which have benefited the masses. 
Do not break them and do not introduce innovations because if you do away with those good 
rules and traditions, the reward of having introduced them will go to those who evolved them 
and the punishment of having despoiled them will be your lot. 
You must know, Maalik, that the people over whom you rule are divided into classes and 
grades and the prosperity and welfare of each class of the society individually and collectively 
are so interdependent upon the well-being of the other classes that the whole set-up represents 
a closely woven net and reciprocal aspect. One class cannot exist peacefully, cannot live 
happily and cannot work without the support and good wishes of the other. 
Amongst them there are the soldiers of the army of Allah who defend His cause, the next 
class is that of the secretaries of the State to whom duties of writing out and issuing special or 
general orders are assigned, the third group is of the judges and magistrates to administer 
justice, the fourth is of officers who maintain law and order and guard the peace and 
prosperity of the country. Then there are common men, the Muslims who pay the taxes levied 
by the government, and non-Muslims who pay the taxes levied by the government, and non- 
Muslims who pay tribute to the State (in lieu of taxes). Then comes the class of men who 
carry on various professions and trades and the last but not the least are the poor and the havenots 
who are considered as the lowest class of the society. The Merciful Allah has fixed rights 
and duties of each one of them. They have been either mentioned in His Book or explained 
through the instructions of the Holy Prophet (s). A complete code of them is preserved with 
us. 
As far as the soldiers are concerned, they are by the commands of Allah a fortress and 
stronghold to guard and defend the subjects and the State. They are the ornaments of the ruler 
and the country. They provide power and protection to the religion. They propagate and 
preserve peace among mankind. In fact, they are the real guardians of peace and through them 
good internal administration can be maintained. The upkeep and maintenance of an army 
depends upon the taxes collected by the State out of which Allah has fixed for them a share. 
With this amount they provide for their requirements, maintain themselves and their arms in 
sound position to defend the religion and the cause of justice. 
The army and the common men (common citizens who pay taxes or tributes) are two 
important classes, but in a Welfare State their well-being cannot be guaranteed without proper 
functioning and preservation of the other classes, the judges and magistrates, the secretaries of 
the State and the officers of various departments who collect various revenues, maintain law 
and order as well as preserve peace and amity among the diverse classes of the society. They 
also guard the rights and privileges of the citizens and look to the performances of various 
duties by individuals and classes. And the prosperity of this whole set-up depends upon the 
traders and industrialists. They act as a medium between the consumers and the suppliers. 
They collect the requirements of the society. They exert to provide goods. They open up 
shops, markets and trading centres. Thus providing the consumers with their necessities, they 
relieve the citizens of the need of running after their requisites of life. 
Then comes the class of the poor and the disabled persons. It is absolutely necessary that they 
should be looked after, helped and well-provided for. The Merciful Allah has explained the 
ways and means of maintaining and providing for each of these classes. And everyone of this 
class has the right upon the ruler of the State that at least minimum necessities for its wellbeing 
and contented living are provided. 
Remember, Maalik that Almighty Allah will not absolve any ruler from his obligations unless 
he sincerely tries his best to discharge his duties, invokes Allah to help him in their 
performance, remains steadfast and diligent on the path of truth and justice and bears all this 
whether the performance of these duties is congenial or hateful to him. 
So far as the army is concerned its chief and commander should be a person who is most 
sincere and faithful to Allah, to the Holy Prophet (s) and to your Imam who is most pious, 
who is famous for his forbearance, clemency and gentleness, who is neither short-tempered 
nor does he get angry quickly, who sympathetically treats sincere excuses and accepts 
apologies, who is kind and compassionate with the weak, but severe against the strong and the 
powerful, who has no vindictiveness which might lead to violence or any inferiority complex 
or weak-mindedness which makes them helpless and dejected. To find and select such 
persons you should have contacts with pious and noble families with high ideals and exalted 
traditions, families well-known for their bravery and courage and generosity and 
magnanimity. They are the people who may be considered as sources of magnificence and 
sublimity of character and fountain-heads of piety and good deeds. 
When you have found and selected such persons then keep an eye over them and watch them 
as parents watch their children so that you may find out if there appears any change in their 
behaviour. Treat them kindly and sympathetically. Do not grudge highest considerations to 
them (if they rightly deserve) and do not refuse small mercies. This kind of treatment will 
create reciprocal tendencies in them and they will trust you and will be faithful to you. Under 
the impression that you have paid enough attention to their major necessities and wants, do 
not close your eyes to their minor requirements and needs because small favours often bear 
better fruits though careful attention to major necessities is very important. Among the 
military officers those should receive your highest respect and consideration who pay most 
attention to the needs of the soldiers under their command who come forward to help the 
soldiers with their personal means and property so that the soldiers may lead a happy and 
contented life and may have full confidence of the future of their families and children. 
If the soldiers are thus satisfied and are free from anxieties and care then they will bravely and 
wholeheartedly face the conflicts. Your constant attention towards the officers and soldiers 
will make them love you more and more. 
The thing which should most gladden the heart of a ruler is the fact that his State is being 
ruled on the principles of equity and justice and that his subjects love him. And your subjects 
will only love you when they have no grievance against you. Their sincerity and loyalty will 
be proved if they gather around you to support your government, when they accept your 
authority without considering it an unbearable burden on their heads and when they do not 
secretly wish your rule to come to an end. So let them have as many justifiable hopes in you 
as they can and fulfil as many as you reasonably can. Speak well of those who deserve your 
praise. Appreciate the good deeds done by them and let these good actions be known publicly. 
The correct and timely publicity of noble actions and golden deeds creates more zeal in the 
minds of the brave and emboldens the cowards and the weaklings. You must know and 
realize the good deeds done by every single individual so that the credit of noble deeds done 
by one may not be given to another. Do not underestimate and underpay the good work done. 
Similarly do not overpay a work simply because it has been done by a very important person 
and do not let his position and prestige be the cause of overvaluation of the merit of his work 
and at the same time do not undervalue a great deed if it is done by a very ordinary person or 
a commoner. Let equity, justice and fairplay be your motto. 
When you are faced with problems which you cannot solve or with a difficult situation from 
which you cannot escape or when uncertain and doubtful circumstances confuse and perplex 
you, then turn to Allah and the Holy Prophet (s) because Allah has thus ordered those whom 
He wants to guide. The way to turn to Allah is to act diligently according to the clear and 
explicit orders given in His Holy Book and to the turn to the Holy Prophet (s) means to follow 
those of his orders about which there is no doubt and ambiguity and which have been 
generally accepted to be correctly recorded. 
So far as dispensing of justice is concerned, you have to be very careful in selecting officers 
for the same. You must select people of excellent character and high calibre and with 
meritorious records. They must possess the following qualifications: Abundance of litigations 
and complexity of cases should not make them lose their temper. 
When they realize that they have committed a mistake in judgement they should not insist on 
it by trying to justify it. When truth is made clear to them or when the right path opens up 
before them, they should not consider it below their dignity to correct the mistake made or to 
undo the wrong done by them. They should not be corrupt, covetous or greedy. They should 
not be satisfied with ordinary enquiry or scrutiny of a case, but should scrupulously go 
through all the pros and cons, they must examine every aspect of the problem carefully, and 
whenever and wherever they find doubtful and ambiguous points, they must stop, go through 
further details, clear the points, and only then proceed with their decisions. They must attach 
the greatest importance to reasoning, arguments and proofs. They should not get tired of 
lengthy discussions and arguments. They must exhibit patience and perseverance in scanning 
the details, in testing the points presented as true, in sifting facts from fiction and when truth 
is revealed to them they must pass their judgements without fear, favour or prejudice. 
They should not develop vanity and conceit when compliments and praises are showered 
upon them. They should not be mislead by flattery and cajolery. But unfortunately they are 
few persons having such characteristics. After you have selected such men to act as your 
judges, make it a point to go through some of their judgements and to check their 
proceedings. Pay them handsomely so that their needs are fully satisfied and they are not 
required to beg or borrow or resort to corruption. Give them such a prestige and position in 
your State that none of your courtiers or officers can overlord them or bring harm to them. Let 
judiciary be above every kind of executive pressure or influence, above fear or favour, 
intrigue or corruption. Take every particular care of this aspect because before your 
appointment this State was under the sway of corrupt, time-serving and wealth-grasping 
opportunists who were lewd, greedy and vicious and who wanted nothing out of a State but a 
sinful consent of amassing wealth and pleasures for themselves. 
Then come the officers of your State. You must supervise their work. They must be appointed 
after a careful scrutiny of their capabilities and characters. These appointments must be made 
originally on probation without any kind of favouritism being shown or influence being 
accepted otherwise tyranny, corruption and misrule will reign in your State. While selecting 
your officers take care to select experienced and honourable persons, members of respectable 
families who had served Islam during its early days because these are usually of noble 
character and good repute. They are not greedy and cannot be easily bribed. They mostly have 
before them the ultimate result of their thoughts and their deeds. Keep them also well-paid so 
that they may not be tempted to lower their standard of morality and may not misappropriate 
the cash of the State which they hold in their trust and if after being paid handsomely they 
prove dishonest, then you will be right to punish them. Therefore keep a careful watch over 
their system of work and rule. 
You may also appoint trustworthy and honest men to keep a watch over the activities of these 
officers. The knowledge that they are being watched secretly will keep them away from 
dishonesty, misrule, malpractice and tyrannizing the subjects. Protect your government from 
dishonest officers. If you find any of them dishonest and your confidential intelligence service 
submits acceptable proofs of his dishonesty, then you must punish him. This may be corporal 
punishment besides dismissal from service and taking back from him all which he has 
dishonestly collected. He must be humiliated and must be made to realize the infamy of his 
wicked deeds. His humiliation and punishment must be given publicly so that it may serve as 
a lesson and a deterrent to others. 
So far as collection of land revenues and taxes are concerned you must always keep in view 
the welfare of the tax-payers which is of primary importance than the taxes themselves 
because these taxes and the tax-payers are the original sources on which the welfare of your 
State and its subjects depend. 
A State really lives upon the revenues collected from the tax-payers. Therefore, more 
importance should be attached to the fertility of land than to the collection of taxes because 
actual taxable capacity of people rests upon the fertility of the land. The ruler, who does not 
pay attention to the prosperity of his subjects and fertility of the land but concentrates only on 
collection of revenues, lays waste the land and consequently ruins the State and brings 
destruction to the creatures of Allah. His rule cannot last for long. 
If the tax-payers complain to you of the heavy incidence to taxation, of any accidental 
calamity, of the vagaries of the monsoons, of the recession of the means of irrigation, of 
floods or destruction of their crops on account of excessive rainfall and if their complaints are 
true, then reduce their taxes. This reduction should be such that it provides them opportunities 
to improve their conditions and eases them of their troubles. 
Decrease in State-income due to such reasons should not depress you because the best 
investment for a ruler is to help his subjects at the time of their difficulties. They are the real 
wealth of a country and any investment on them even in the form of reduction of taxes, will 
be returned to the State in the shape of the prosperity of its cities and improvement of the 
country at large. At the same time you will be in a position to command and secure their love, 
respect and praises along with the revenues. Will that not be a lasting happiness? 
Not only this, but your benign rule and humane treatment will so affect them that they will 
come to your help at the time of your difficulties and you will be able to rely on their support. 
Your kindness, your clemency and your justice will be a kind of moral training to them, and 
the contented, happy and prosperous life, for which they will be grateful to you, will be the 
best support, strongest protection and the greatest treasury for you. 
Later if such circumstances arrive that you find yourself in need of their support, their help, 
their confidence, their wealth and their man-power, then they will have no grudge against you. 
Remember, Maalik! If a country is prosperous and if its people are well-to-do then it will 
happily and willingly bear any burden. 
The poverty of the people is the actual cause of the devastation and ruination of a country and 
the main cause of the poverty of the people is the desire of its ruler and officers to amass 
wealth and possessions whether by fair or foul means. They are afraid of losing their posts or 
positions and sway or rule and want to make the most during the shortest time at their 
disposal. They never learn any lesson from the history of nations and never pay any attention 
to the commands of Allah. 
You will also have to be very careful about your secretaries. You should entrust your work 
only to those who are the best among them. 
Specially the affairs which are of confidential nature and which deal with secrets, and the 
security of the State should be entrusted only to men of noble character because men who are 
intoxicated with power, position and prestige carry on propaganda and speak against the 
government in public, they openly misbehave with you and consider themselves so important 
as to ignore you or your orders in financial transactions essential to the State, they avoid 
placing necessary papers before you or attending to important correspondence. 
Particular care should be taken that when the officers make contracts on behalf of the 
government or sign agreements, these contracts and agreements are not defective or harmful 
to the State, if they are negotiating any treaties and alliances they do not overlook or forsake 
the interests of the State or if they find the State in a weak and embarrassing position on 
account of unfavourable terms of treaties or due to intrigues, they should be able to find 
sensible ways out of them. See that they know and realize their proper place and rank, 
because he who does not realize his place and position will never understand those of others. 
One more thing about these officers: You must remember not to select them for very 
important posts and not to trust them completely simply because you have found them honest, 
diligent, trustworthy and intelligent and have formed a good opinion about them because 
there are some people who, when it suits them, pretend honesty, diligence and fidelity and can 
put on the garb of piety and virtue and thus find their ways in the hearts of the rulers, though 
actually they are neither honest nor diligent nor wise nor sagacious. Therefore, you must 
always look to the record or reputation of the services of such men during previous regimes; 
more importance should be attached to their good reputation. This kind of selection and 
supervision will prove that you are faithful to Allah and that you wish your Imam well. 
Thus you must appoint one officer as the Head of each important branch of your government. 
He should have knowledge and wisdom enough to cope successfully with all the intricate 
problems of his department and should be diligent enough to cope with extensive work. 
Remember well that if there is any defect in your officers and you are tolerating it, then you 
and only you are responsible for all those evils. 
I want to advise you about your businessmen and industrialists. Treat them well, and order 
your officers to follow the same policy. 
There may be local businessmen carrying on their trade in certain places or those who send 
their merchandise from one place to another. There may even be those who import and export 
goods. Similarly there may be industrialists and manufacturers as well as industrial labour or 
men engaged in the handicrafts. They all deserve sympathy, protection and good treatment. 
They all are the sources of wealth to the country. They provide goods for the consumers. 
Most of these traders carry and convey these goods from across deserts, seas and over open 
lands and mountains, their consignments are brought from distant lands, often from places 
which are not easy to approach and where usually people do not care or do not dare to go. 
These businessmen are usually peace-loving people, not given to mischievous disturbances 
and seditious fomentation. You must look after their interest and protect them whether they 
are trading in your cities or towns or whether they are travelling over the countries carrying 
goods from place to place. 
One more thing about these traders and industrialists. While treating them most 
sympathetically you must keep an eye over there activities as well. 
You know they are usually stingy misers, intensely self-centered and selfish, suffering from 
the obsession of grasping and accumulating wealth. 
They often hoard their goods to get more profit out of them by creating scarcity and by 
indulging in black-marketing. Such a condition is extremely injurious to the public on one 
hand and disgraceful to the ruler on the other. 
You must put a stop to all such practices because the Holy Prophet (s) has explicitly 
prohibited such practices. Remember that trade should go on between the buyers and sellers 
according to correct measures and weights and on such reasonable terms that neither the 
consumers nor the suppliers should have to face losses. But even with all the sympathetic 
treatments accorded to them and with all the facilities provided to them, if the traders and 
industrialists carry on hoarding and black-marketing, then you must punish them according to 
the intensity of their crime. 
Then I want to caution you about the poor. Fear Allah about their conditions and you attitude 
towards them. They have no support, no resources and no opportunities. They are poor, they 
are destitute and many of them are cripples and unfit for work. Some of them come out 
begging and some (who maintain self-respect) do not beg, but their conditions speak of their 
distress, poverty, destitution and wants. For the sake of Allah, Maalik, protect them and their 
rights. He has laid the responsibility of this upon your shoulders. You must fix a share for 
them from Baytul Mal (the Government Treasury). Besides this reservation in cash, you must 
also reserve a share in kind of crops etc. from government granaries in cities where foodgrains 
are stored as are cultivated on State-owned land because in these storage the share of 
those living far away from any particular city is equal to the share of those living nearby. 
Let me remind you once again that you are made responsible for guarding the rights of the 
poor people and for looking after their welfare. Take care that the conceit of your position and 
vanity of wealth may not deceive you to lose sight of such a grave and important 
responsibility. Yours is such an important post that you cannot claim immunity from the 
responsibility of even minor errors of commission or omission with an excuse that you were 
engrossed in the major problems of the State which you have solved diligently. 
Therefore, be very careful of the welfare of the poor people. Do not be arrogant and vain 
against them. Remember that you have to take particular care of those who cannot reach you, 
whose poverty-stricken and disease-ridden sight may be hateful to you, and whom society 
treats with disgust, detestation and contempt. You should be a source of comfort, love and 
respect to them. Appoint a respectable, honest and pious person - a person who fears Allah 
and who can treat them honourably, order him to find out everything about them and to 
submit a report to you. 
Then treat these poor people in such a way that on the Day of Judgement you can plead your 
case successfully before Allah because of all classes of your subjects this class deserves more 
of your attention, sympathy and fair-deal. 
Though everyone of these poor persons deserves your sympathy and you will have to do 
justice to His cause to achieve His favour, yet you should pay more attention to young 
orphans and old cripples. They neither have any support nor can they conveniently come out 
begging. They cannot reach you; therefore, you must reach them. 
Remember that the fulfillment of this obligation and duty is considered as a tiresome burden 
by most of the rulers but to those who desire to achieve His Blessings and to enter into His 
Realm, even this work seems light and congenial. They bear it happily, dutifully and 
sincerely. They find pleasures in it and they believe in the promise made by Allah. 
Out of your hours of work, fix a time for the complainants and for those who want to 
approach you with their grievances. During this time you should do no other work but hear 
them and pay attention to their complaints and grievances. For this purpose you must arrange 
public audience for them during this audience, for the sake of Allah, treat them with kindness, 
courtesy and respect. Do not let your army and police be in the audience hall at such times so 
that those who have grievances against your regime may speak to you freely, unreservedly 
and without fear. 
All this is a necessary factor of your rule because I have often heard the Holy Prophet (s) 
saying, "That nation or regime, where that rights of the depressed, destitute and suppressed 
are not guarded and where the mighty and powerful persons are not forced to accede these 
rights, cannot achieve salvation". You must remember that in those audiences the most 
common men will gather. therefore, if you find them misbehaving, becoming unmannerly or 
if you feel that their talk is irrelevant, tolerate them; do not be rude and do not insult them, so 
that Allah may be kind and merciful to you and may reward you for obeying His commands 
explicitly. Treat them courteously, hear their grievances patiently and if you are forced to 
reject their demands then reject them in such a way that your rejection may please them as 
much as your grants. 
Then there are certain duties which only you will have to perform and which none of your 
officers can carry out. Among them are replies to the letters of your commissioners and 
governors and are beyond the jurisdiction or preview of your secretaries. If you find that your 
officers are not attending as much to the complaints of the public as they should, then you 
should personally attend to them. You must finish a day's work on that day only because each 
day will bring its own special work for you. Reserve your best time for prayers to Allah, 
though every work of the State is the work of Allah, especially, if you are sincere and honest, 
and if your subjects are happy with your rule and are safe from your oppression. 
Among those duties that you are to perform diligently must be your daily prayers. These 
should be offered sincerely and persistently. You must fix times for this during days and 
nights. You must tax your bodily strength for this duty though it may tire you. Your 
observance of prayers should be sincere and faultless and should neither be so long as to tire 
out those who follow you in these prayers nor so short as to be faulty and defective because 
amongst those who follow you during the prayers, there may be some sick persons, while 
others may have to attend to some important work. When the Holy Prophet (s) sent me to 
Yemen I asked him how to lead the prayers. He advised me, "Offer prayers like a weak and 
old person and be kind to the faithful" (so that weak and old persons may follow your prayers 
easily and happily). 
You must take care not to cut yourself off from the public. Do not place a curtain of false 
prestige between you and those over whom you rule. Such pretensions and show of pomp and 
pride are in reality manifestations of inferiority complex and vanity. The result of such an 
attitude is that you remain ignorant of the conditions of your subjects and of the actual cases 
of the events occurring in the State. 
You will fail to realize comparative importance of events taking place and may attach great 
significance to minor events and may slip over important facts, similarly you may attach 
importance to mediocre or insignificant people and may ignore real men of consequence; and 
what is more, you may lose the power of distinction between good and bad and may take one 
for the other or hopelessly mix up the two. After all a ruler is as much a human being as any 
other man and he may remain ignorant of facts of which his officers want to keep him in the 
dark (and on which the public may throw light). Thus truth may get mixed up with falsehood 
and may not be distinguished because there are no birthmarks on the forehead of truth that it 
may be easily differentiated from falsehood, one has to search for facts and sift realities from 
fictions, only then can one reach the truth. Think for yourself, there are only two categories of 
rulers and you may belong to one of them. 
You may either be a pious, sincere and diligent ruler, doing the right thing at the right 
moment and following the principles of justice and equity and you may be protecting rights of 
others and doing your best to fulfil your obligations, in that case why hide from the public, 
why draw a curtain around yourself! Or you may be a miser refusing to be generous to 
anyone, in that case people will gradually come to know of this trait of your character and 
will gradually give up asking for favours from you but do not overlook the fact that most of 
their demands will have nothing to do with your private purse, they will be about the rights of 
people, obligations of the State, complaints against the State, oppressions, and solicitations of 
justice, then why try to avoid hearing these requests! 
You should never overlook the fact that around the rulers there usually are certain privileged 
persons (relatives and friends). They may often try to take advantage of their status and may 
resort to selfishness, intrigues, fraud, corruption and oppression. If you find such people 
around you then do away with them (however closely connected they may be with you), 
immediately bring an end to the scandal and clear your surroundings of all such moral and 
spiritual filth. 
You must never give lands in permanent lease with all proprietary and ownership rights to 
your friends and relatives. You must never allow them to take possession of the source of 
water-supply or lands which have special utility for the communes. If they get possession of 
such holdings they will oppress others to derive undue benefits and thus gather all the fruits 
for themselves leaving for you a bad reputation in this world and punishment in the next. 
Be fair in dispensing justice. Punish those who deserve punishment even though he may be 
your near relation or a close friend and even if such an action may give you pangs of sorrow 
and grief. Bear such a sorrow patiently and hope for Divine reward. I assure you this will bear 
good fruits. 
If on account of your strict measures people get suspicious of your behaving like a tyrant and 
oppressor, then come out openly before them and explain to them the reasons of your actions 
and let them see the facts for themselves and realize the truth. This will give training to your 
mind, will be an act of kindness to the subjects and the confidence thus reposed in them will 
make them support justice and truth while you will achieve the end you have in view of 
obtaining their support in the cause of truth. 
If your enemy invites you to a Peace Treaty that will be agreeable to Allah, then never refuse 
to accept such an offer because peace will bring rest and comfort to your armies, will relieve 
you of anxieties and worries, and will bring prosperity and affluence to your people. But even 
after such treaties be very careful of the enemies and do not place too much confidence in 
their promises because they often resort to Peace Treaty to deceive and delude you and take 
advantage of your negligence, carelessness and trust. At the same time be very careful, never 
break your promise with your enemy, never forsake the protection or support that you have 
offered to him, never go back upon your words, and never violate the terms of the treaty. You 
must even risk your life to fulfil the promises given and the terms settled because of all the 
obligations laid by Almighty Allah upon man (in respect to other men) there is none so 
important as to keep one's promises when made. 
Though people may differ in their religions and ideologies and may have divergent views 
upon various problems of State, yet they all agree that promises when made must be fulfilled. 
Even the heathens take care to keep the promises made among themselves because they have 
seen and realised the evil effects of breaking promises. Therefore, take very particular care of 
promises made, never go back upon the words given, never go into the offensive without 
previously challenging and giving an ultimatum. Deception and fraud even against your 
enemy is a deception against Allah and none but a wretched sinner would dare do that. 
Allah has given promises and treaties the high rank of being messengers of peace and 
prosperity and through His Kindness and Mercy has made them a common desire (of keeping 
promises) in the minds of all men and a common requirement for all human beings. He has 
made them such a shelter and asylum that everybody desires to be under their protection. 
Therefore, there should be no mental reservation, no fraud, no deception and no underlying 
meanings in between the lines when you make a promise or conclude a treaty. Do not use 
such words and phrases in your promises and treaties as have possibilities of being translated 
in more than one way or as may have various interpretations and many explanations, let there 
be no ambiguity in them, and let them be clear, precise and to the point. And when once a 
treaty has been finally concluded, do not try to take advantage of any ambiguous word or 
phrase in it. If you find yourself in a critical situation on account of the treaty made in the 
cause of Allah, then try to face the situation and bear the consequences bravely and do not try 
to back out of the terms that account, because to face such perplexing situations as may gain 
His Rewards and Blessings is better than to break your promises on that account and earn that 
about which you feel nervous and for which you will have to answer Allah and which may 
bring down His Wrath upon you in this world and damnation in the next. 
Beware of the sin of shedding blood without religious justification and sanction because there 
is nothing quicker to bring down the Wrath of Allah, to take away His Blessings, to make you 
more deserving of His Wrath and to reduce the span of your life than to shed innocent blood. 
On the Day of Judgement Allah will first attend to sins of bloodshed carried out by man 
against man. Therefore, never try to strengthen your power, position and prestige by shedding 
innocent blood. Such murders instead of making your position strong will not only 
considerably weaken it but may also transfer your power totally, taking it away from you and 
entrusting it to somebody else. 
If you have intentionally murdered a man then no excuse shall be acceptable to Allah or to me 
because punishment of such a crime is necessary. 
And if you kill a man by mistake without any intention or motive of killing or while 
delivering legal penalties, your whip, sword or hand unintentionally and inadvertently deals a 
fatal blow because even a forcefully delivered slap or box on the ear may cause death, then do 
not, on account of your prestige and position, refuse paying the compensation to the heirs. 
Beware and do not develop the trait of self-admiration and self-appreciation. Do not get 
conceited of the good points that you find in your good character or good deeds that you have 
done. Do not let flattery and cajolery make you vain and egoist. Remember that of all the 
cunning ruses of the devil to undo good deeds of the pious people and to affect their piety, 
flattery and false praises are the ones on which it relies the most. 
Do not boast of the favours and kindnesses that you have done to your subjects and do not try 
to make them realise this, do not think too much of the good that you have done to them, and 
do not go back upon the promises made, all these three habits are very ugly features of one's 
character. The practice of boasting over the favours done undoes the good done, the habit of 
exaggerating and thinking very highly of our good actions will make us lose the guidance of 
Allah, and the habit of breaking one's promises is disliked both by Allah and by man. The 
Merciful Allah says, "It is most hateful in the sight of Allah, to say something and not to 
practice it."
