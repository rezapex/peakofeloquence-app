Verily there are many people in this world who have forsaken their salvation and in its place

unruly and inordinate desires and they work and speak on behalf of these desires only. 
This affair has placed me in an awkward position. The people, who have united against me 
are those who want everything out of this vicious and wicked world for themselves and for 
their pleasures. They have drawn their swords against me. I am trying to undo the harm they 
have done but I am afraid lest the problem should become very serious and unresolvable. 
You know very well that no one is more desirous of the Unity of Muslims than I and the only 
thing which I want to achieve by this unity is the Blessings of Allah and my salvation. I shall 
do what I have resolved to do even though you change the good opinion which you had about 
me when we last parted. Surely, unfortunate is he who possesses wisdom and acquires 
experience and yet does not care to make use of either. 
I cannot tolerate lies and I cannot bear to see people undoing the good done by Allah through 
Islam. 
Therefore you should give up forming opinion about things which you have not clearly 
understood or visualized because many people will try their best to influence you with their 
insinuations.
