This is a will of a creature of Allah, Ali son of Abu Taalib (a). It instructs (his heirs) how to 
spend his property only to gain the Blessings of Allah so that Allah may grant him peace and 
allow him to enter His Paradise. After me my son Hasan (a) will be the administrator, 
executor and testator of my property. He can spend it according to the laws of Islam in 
helping the poor, destitute and the needy in accordance with the canons ordained by Allah. If 
anything happens to Hasan (a) and Husayn (a) is alive after him, then he will be the next 
executor and testator and should act according to the spirit of the instructions given herein. 
Verily, for the two sons of Fatima (a), Hasan and Husayn (a), the share out of my property is 
equal to the shares of my other sons (being Imams they should not be barred from taking their 
share and at the same time their share cannot be more on account of their being administrators 
and executors). I have appointed sons of Fatima (a) executors to please Allah and out of 
respect and love that I bear towards the Holy Prophet (a) and his daughter (peace of Allah be 
upon them and their descendants). 
I order the executor to keep this property as it is and to spend the income on the poor and 
destitute as desired by me. I further order that young date-palm of the estate not to be cut until 
it is fully afforested with date-palm and take up the shape of a well-developed palm-orchard. 
My widows are to be treated with respect and their shares, out of this property, are to be 
included in the shares of their sons and even if any of them loses her son she will still enjoy 
her share, she should not be left unhelped to work like a slave-woman for her living.
