. 
I do not want to offer any excuse for having objected to his introducing innovations in 
religion. If my objections to the introduction of innovation and my advice to him to give it up 
was considered by him a sin committed by me, then I do not attach any importance to his 
opinion, because well-wishers are often blamed, and their good advice is misconstrued but 
they do their duty to man and religion. Allah in the Holy Book repeats the saying of a prophet 
which appropriately represents my position. He says, "I only intend to reform you as much as 
I can. My success lies with Allah. I have faith in Him and trust in His help."
