title: Letter 81
description: Imam Ali (a) had entrusted to Munzir bin Jarud Abdi something which he misappropriated. Thereupon Imam Ali (a) wrote the following letter to him.
---

The fact is that piety, honesty and righteousness of your father made me misjudge your 
character. I thought you were a worthy son of a worthy father and were following him in his 
honesty and righteousness. But all of a sudden I received about you news which confirms the 
fact that you do not check and control your inordinate desires, that you do not attach any 
importance to your life after death and you want to adorn and beautify you life at the cost of 
your salvation and that you are forsaking your religion to provide for your relatives. 
If all that is reported to me about you is correct, then the very camel you own or even the 
strap-shoe is superior to you. You and men of your calibre are not the persons to be confided 
with the financial affairs of a country or to be assigned to important vacancies of the State or 
to be entrusted to check and control dishonesty and disloyalty. Therefore, as soon as you 
receive this letter come back to me.
