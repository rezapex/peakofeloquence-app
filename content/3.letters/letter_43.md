I had sent against him (Zahaak) a strong force of Muslim fighters. When he realised this, he 
wanted to run away, giving up loot and plunder. Before sunset our expeditionary force 
overtook him and his guerrillas, a skirmish did take place, not worth being mentioned as a 
battle, and he fled. When he was caught by the throat he thought a cowardly retreat to be the 
best solution. 
Do not take to heart the behaviour of Quraysh. To talk about their scepticism, their enmity of 
Islam, their revolt against the cause of Allah and their desire to bring harm to me are a waste 
of time. They now are as much bent upon doing me injustice and fighting against me, as they 
were unanimously against the Holy Prophet (s). May Allah punish them for their sins. They 
have not even paid any consideration to the relationship that existed between them and I. 
They have deprived me of the estate of my mother's son. 
As far as your enquiry about my intention against the enemies of Islam is concerned, my 
opinion is to combat those who have made up their minds to harm the cause of Islam. I shall 
keep on combating them to the end of my life. 
I am neither emboldened by abundance of followers nor am I disheartened by their scarcity. 
Do not think that your brother will lose heart if people forsake him and give up their help or 
he will humiliate himself, bow down against heavy odds, submit to unreasonable demands of 
others or accept their commands or orders like a beast of burden. 
So far as I am concerned I am like a person about whom a poet of Bani Salim says:- 
"If you enquire about me, my beloved, Then hear me: 
I am very strong to face calamities and reverses; 
I cannot tolerate 
That signs of sorrows and griefs on my face 
Make my enemies happy, 
And increase sorrows of my friends".
