Sometimes a man feels very happy for getting a thing which was actually destined for him 
and feels sorry for not getting a thing which he was not destined to get. Therefore, you should 
not feel happy if your desires are fulfilled and should not feel sorry for deprivations. 
(Leave everything to the Will of Allah). You should not consider the achievements of the 
pleasures of life or opportunities of revenge for wrongs done to you as the main blessings 
bestowed upon you but you must feel happy for good deeds that you have provided for the 
Hereafter. 
You must feel sorry for the wealth that you have left without spending it on good causes and 
the opportunities you have lost of doing noble and pious deeds. Nothing should worry you but 
the idea of death and the life after death.
