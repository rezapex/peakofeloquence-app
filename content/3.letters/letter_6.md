Muslims, Allah will let him wander in the wilderness of his ignorance and schism. 
O Mu'awiya! I am sure that if you give up self-aggrandizement and self-interest, if you

least concerned with the episode. 
But it is a different thing that you create all these false rumours and carry on this heinous 
propaganda to gain your ulterior motives. Well you may do whatever you like.
