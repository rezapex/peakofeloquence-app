*Referring to events in the future*

> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام)

> يومىء فيها إلى ذكر الملاحم

He will direct desires towards (the path of) guidance while people will
have turned guidance towards desires, and he will turn their views to
the direction of the Qur\'an while the people will have turned the
Qur\'an to their views.

> يَعْطِفُ الْهَوَى عَلَى الْهُدَى إِذَا عَطَفُوا الْهُدَى عَلَى الْهَوَى، وَيَعْطِفُ الرَّأْيَ عَلَى الْقُرْآنِ
> إِذَا عَطَفُوا الْقُرْآنَ عَلَى الرَّأْيِ.

## A part of the same sermon

(Before this Enjoiner of Good
,
matters will deteriorate) till war will rage among you with full force,
showing forth its teeth, with udders full of sweet milk but with a sour
tip. Beware, it will be tomorrow and the morrow will come soon with
things which you do not know. The Man in power, not from this crowd,
will take to task all those were formerly appointed for their ill deeds
and the earth will pour forth its eternal treasures and fling before him
easily her keys. He will show you the just way of behaviour and revive
the Qur\'an and *sunnah* which have become lifeless (among people).

> حَتَّى تَقُومَ الْحَرْبُ بِكُمْ عَلَى سَاق، بَادِياً نَوَاجِذُهَا، ممْلُوءَةً أَخْلاَفُهَا، حُلْواً
> رَضَاعُهَا، عَلْقَماً عَاقِبَتُهَا.

> أَلاَ وَفِي غَد ـ وَسَيَأْتِي غَدٌ بِمَا لاَ تَعْرِفُونَ ـ يَأْخُذُ الْوَالِي مِنْ غَيْرِهَا عُمَّالَهَا عَلَى
> مَسَاوِىءِ أَعْمَالِهَا، وَتُخْرِجُ لَهُ الاْرْضُ أَفَالِيذَ كَبِدِهَا، وَتُلْقي إِلَيْهِ سِلْماً مَقَالِيدَهَا،
> فَيُرِيكُمْ كَيْفَ عَدْلُ السِّيرَة و يُحْيِي مَيِّتَ الْكِتابِ و الْسُّنَّةِ.

## A part of the same sermon

As if I see (him), he (the Enjoiner of Evil),

is shouting in Syria (ash-Sham) and is extending his banners to the
outskirts of Kufah. He is bent towards it like the biting of the
she-camel. He has covered the ground with heads. His mouth is wide open
and (the trampling of) his footsteps on the ground have become heavy.
His advance is broad and his attacks are severe.

> كأَنَّي بِهِ قَدْ نَعَقَ بِالشَّامِ، وَفَحَصَ بِرَايَاتِهِ فِي ضَوَاحِي كُوفَانَ، فَعَطَفَ عَلَيْهَا عَطْفَ
> الضَّرُوسِ، وَفَرَشَ الاْرْضَ بِالرُّؤُوسِ، قَدْ فَغَرَتْ فَاغِرَتُهُ، وَثَقُلَتْ فِي الاْرْضِ وَطْأَتُهُ، بَعِيدَ
> الْجَوْلَةِ، عَظِيمَ الصَّوْلَةِ.

By Allah, he will disperse you throughout the earth till only a few of
you remain, like kohl in the eye. You will continue like this till the
Arabs return to their senses. You should therefore stick to established
ways, clear signs and the early period which has the lasting virtues of
the Prophethood. You should know that Satan makes his ways easy so that
you may follow him on his heels.

> وَاللهِ لِيُشَرِّدَنَّكُمْ فِي أَطْرَافِ الاْرْضِ حَتَّى لاَ يَبْقَى مِنْكُمْ إِلاِّ قَلَيلٌ، كَالْكُحْلِ فِي
> الْعَيْنِ، فَلاَ تَزَالُونَ كَذلِكَ، حَتَّى تَؤُوبَ إِلَى الْعَرَبِ عَوَازِبُ أَحْلاَمِهَا! فَالْزَمُوا
> السُّنَنَ الْقَائِمَةَ، وَالاْثَارَ الْبَيِّنَةَ، وَالْعَهْدَ الْقَرِيبَ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِ بَاقِي النُّبُوَّةِ.
> وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ إِنَّمَا يُسَنِّي لَكُمْ طُرُقَهُ لِتَتَّبِعُوا عَقِبَهُ.

-  This prophecy of
    Amir al-mu\'minin is with regard to the appearance of the Twelfth
    Imam, Abu\'l-Qasim Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Mahdi
    (p.b.u.h.).]
-  This refers to
    \`Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan who came to power in Syria (ash-Sham)
    after his father Marwan ibn al-Hakam and then after the killing of
    al-Mukhtar ibn Abi \`Ubayd ath-Thaqafi in his encounter with Mus\`ab
    ibn az-Zubayr he proceeded towards Iraq. He clashed with Mus\`ab\'s
    force at Maskin near Dayru\'l-jathaliq in the outskirts of Kufah.
    After defeating him he made a victorious entry into Kufah and took
    allegiance from its inhabitants. Then he sent al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf
    ath-Thaqafi to Mecca to fight with \`Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr.
    Consequently this man besieged Mecca and stoned it, and shed the
    blood of thousands of innocent persons like water. He killed Ibn
    az-Zubayr and hung his body on the gallows. He perpetrated such
    atrocities on the people that one shudders at the thought of
    them.]
