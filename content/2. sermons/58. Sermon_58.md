*Addressing the Kharijites, Amir al-mu\'minin said:*

> ومن كلامه (عليه السلام)

> كلّم به الخوارج حين اعتزلوا الحكومة وتنادوا: أن لا حكم إلاّ لله

Storms may overtake you while there may be none to prick you (for
reforms). Shall I be witness to my becoming heretic after acceptance of
Faith and fighting in the company of the Prophet*?!*

***\"In that case I shall be misguided and I shall not be on the right
path.\"*** ***(Qur\'an, 6:56).***

So you should return to your evil places, and get back on the traces of
your heels. Beware! Certainly you will meet, after me, overwhelming
disgrace and sharp sword and tradition that will be adopted by the
oppressors as a norm towards
you.{#epub.html_fref_232a6e27_1

> أَصَابَكُمْ حَاصِبٌ، وَلاَ بَقِيَ مِنْكُمْ آبرٌ، أَبَعْدَ إِيمَاني بِاللهِ وَجِهَادِي مَعَ رَسُولِ اللهِ
> (صلى الله عليه وآله) أَشْهَدُ عَلَى نَفْسِي بِالْكُفْرِ !لَقَدْ )ضَلَلْتُ إِذاً وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ
> الْمُهْتَدِينَ !(فَأُوبُوا شَرَّ مَآب، وَارْجِعُوا عَلَى أَثَرِ الاْعْقَابِ، أَمَا إِنَّكُمْ سَتَلْقَوْنَ
> بَعْدِي ذُلاًّ شَامِلاً، وَسَيْفاً قَاطِعاً، وَأَثَرَةً يَتَّخِذُهَا الظَّالِمونَ فِيكُمْ سُنَّةً.

***As-Sayyid ar-Radi says*****:** In the *words \"wala baqiyah minkum
abirun\"* used by Amir al-mu\'minin the *\"abir\"* has been related with
*\"ba\'\"* and *\"ra\'\"* and it has been taken from the Arab saying
*\"rajulun abirun\"* which means the man who prunes the date-palm trees
and improves them. In one version the word is *\"athir\"* and its
meaning is \"relator of good news.\"

In my view this is more appropriate, as though Amir al-mu\'minin intends
to say that there should remain none to carry news. In one version the
word appears as *\"abiz\"* with *\"za\'\"* which means one who leaps.
One who dies is also called *\"abiz\".*

> قال الشريف: قوله عليه السلام : «ولا بقي منكم آبر» يُروى على ثلاثة أوجه:
> أحدها أن يكون كما ذكرناه، بالراء، من قولهم: رجلٌ آبِرٌ: للذي يأبر النخل،
> أي: يصلحه. ويروى: «آثِرٌ»، يُراد به: الذي يأثر الحديث، أي: يحكيه ويرويه،
> وهو أصح الوجوه عندي، كأنه عليه السلام قال: لا بقي منكم مُخبر! ويروى:
> «آبِز» ـ بالزاي معجمة ـ وهو: الواثب، والهالك أيضاً يقال له: آبزٌ

-  History
    corroborates that after Amir al-mu\'minin, the Kharijites had to
    face all sorts of ignominy and disgrace and wherever they raised
    their heads for creating trouble, they were met with swords and
    spears. Thus Ziyad ibn Abih, \`Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad, al-Hajjaj ibn
    Yusuf, Mus\`ab ibn az-Zubayr and al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufrah left no
    stone unturned in annihilating them from the surface of the globe,
    particularly al-Muhallab chased them for nineteen years, routed them
    thoroughly and rested only after completing their destruction.\
    At-Tabari writes that when ten thousand Kharijites collected in
    Silla wa sillibra (the name of a mountain in Ahwaz) then al-Muhallab
    faced them so steadfastly that he killed seven thousand Kharijites,
    while the remaining three thousand fled towards Kirman for life. But
    when the Governor of Persia noticed their rebellious activities he
    surrounded them in Sabur and killed a good number of them then and
    there. Those remained again fled to Isfahan and Kirman. From there
    they again formed a contingent and advanced towards Kufah via
    Basrah. Al-Harith ibn Abi Rabi\`ah al-Makhzumi and \`Abd ar-Rahman
    ibn Mikhnaf al-Azdi stood up with six thousand combatants to stop
    their advance, and turned them out of Iraq\'s boundaries. In this
    way successive encounters completely trampled their military power
    and turning them out of cities compelled them to roam about in the
    deserts. Afterwards also, when they rose in the form of groups they
    were crushed. (at-Ta\'rikh, Vol. 2, pp. 580-591); Ibn al-Athir, Vol.
    4, pp. 196-206).]
