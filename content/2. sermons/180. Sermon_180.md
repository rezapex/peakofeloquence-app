*Condemning his disobedient men*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> في ذمّ العاصين من أصحابه

I praise Allah for whatever matter He ordained and whatever action He
destines and for my trial with you, O group of people who do not obey
when I order and do not respond when I call you. If you are at ease you
engage in (conceited) conversation, but if you are faced with battle you
show weakness.

If people agree on one Imam you taunt them. If you are faced with an
arduous matter you turn away from it. May others have no father (woe to
your enemy!) what are you waiting for in the matter of your assistance
and for fighting for your rights? For you there is either death or
disgrace. By Allah, if my day (of death) comes. and it is sure to come,
it will cause separation between me and you while I am sick of your
company and feel alone although I am with you.

> أَحْمَدُ اللهَ عَلَى مَا قَضَى مِنْ أَمْر، وَقَدَّرَ مِنْ فِعْل، وَعَلَى ابْتِلاَئِي بِكُم أَيَّتُهَا
> الْفِرْقَةُ الَّتِي إذَا أَمَرْتُ لَمْ تُطِعْ، وَإذَا دَعَوْتُ لَمْ تُجِبْ، إنْ أُمْهِلْتُمْ خُضْتُمْ، وَإنْ
> حُورِبْتُمْ خُرْتُمْ، وَإنِ اجْتَمَعَ النَّاسُ عَلَى إمَام طَعَنْتُمْ، وَإنْ أُجِبْتُمْ إلَى مُشَاقَّة
> نَكَصْتُمْ.

> لاَ أَبَا لِغَيْرِكُمْ! مَا تَنْتَظِرُونَ بِنَصْرِكُمْ وَالْجِهَادِ عَلَى حَقِّكُمْ؟ الْمَوْتَ أَوِ الذُّلَّ لَكُمْ؟
> فَوَاللهِ لَئِنْ جَاءَ يَوْمِي ـ وَلَيَأْتِيَنِّي ـ لَيُفَرِّقَنَّ بَيْني وَبَيْنَكُمْ وَأَنا لِصُحْبَتِكُمْ قَال،
> وَبِكُمْ غَيْرُ كَثِير.

May Allah deal with you! Is there no religion which may unite you or
sense of shamefulness that may sharpen you? Is it not strange that
Mu'awiyah calls out to some rude low people and they follow him without
any support or grant, but when I call you, although you are the
successors of Islam and the (worthy) survivors of the people, with
support and distributed grants you scatter away from me and oppose me?

Truly, there is nothing between me to you which I like and you also like
it, or with which I am angry and you may also unite against it. What I
love most is death. I have taught you the Qur\'an, clarified to you
arguments, apprised you of what you were ignorant and made you swallow
what you were spitting out. Even a blind man would have been able to
see, and he who was sleeping would have been awakened. How ignorant of
Allah is their leader Mu'awiyah and their instructor Ibn an-Nabighah!

> لله أَنْتُمْ! أمَا دِينٌ يَجْمَعُكُمْ! وَلاَ مَحْمِيّةٌ تَشْحَذُكُمْ ! أَوَلَيْسَ عَجَباً أَنَّ مُعَاوِيَةَ يَدْعُو
> الْجُفَاةَ الطَّغَامَ فَيَتَّبِعُونَهُ عَلَى غَيْرِ مَعُونَة وَلاَ عَطَاء، وَأَنَا أَدْعُوكُمْ ـ وَأَنْتُمْ
> تَرِيكَةُ الاْسْلاَمِ، وَبَقِيَّةُ النَّاسِ ـ إلَى الْمَعُونَةِ أَوطَائِفَة مِنَ الْعَطَاءِ، فَتَفَرَّقُونَ
> عَنِّي وَتَخْتَلِفُونَ عَلَيَّ؟ إِنَّهُ لاَ يَخْرُجُ إِلَيْكُمْ مِنْ أَمْرِي رِضىً فَتَرْضَوْنَهُ، وَلاَ سُخْطٌ
> فَتَجْتَمِعُونَ عَلَيْهِ، وَإنَّ أَحَبَّ مَا أَنَا لاَق إِلَيَّ الْمَوْتُ! قَدْ دَارَسْتُكُمُ الْكِتَابَ،
> وَفَاتَحْتُكُمُ الْحِجَاجَ، وَعَرَّفْتُكُمْ مَا أَنْكَرْتُمْ، وَسَوَّغْتُكُمْ مَا مَجَجْتُمْ، لَوْ كَانَ الاْعْمَى
> يَلْحَظُ، أَوِ النَّائِمُ يَسْتَيْقِظُ! وَأَقْرِبْ بِقَوْم مِنَ الْجَهْلِ بِاللهِ قَائِدُهُمْ مُعَاوِيَةُ!
> وَمُؤَدِّبُهُمُ ابْنُ النَّابِغَةِ!

-  \"an-Nabighah\"
    is the surname of Layla bint Harmalah al-\`Anaziyyah, mother of
    \`Amr ibn al-\`As. The reason for attributing him to his mother is
    her common reputation in the matter. When Arwa bint al-Harith ibn
    \`Abd al-Muttalib went to Mu\`awiyah, during the conversation, when
    \`Amr ibn al-\`As intervened, she said to him: \"O\' son of
    an-Nabighah, you too dare speak, although your mother was known
    publicly and was a singer of Mecca. That is why five persons claimed
    you (as a son), and when she was asked she admitted that five people
    had visited her and that you should be regarded as the son of him
    you resembled most. You must have resembled al-\`As ibn Wa\'il and
    therefore you came to be known as his son.\"\
    These five persons were (1) al-\`As ibn Wa\'il, (2) Abu Lahab, (3)
    Umayyah ibn Khalaf, (4) Hisham ibn al-Mughirah, and (5) Abu Sufyan
    ibn Harb. (Ibn \`Abd Rabbih, al-\`lqd al-farid, vol. 2, p. 120; Ibn
