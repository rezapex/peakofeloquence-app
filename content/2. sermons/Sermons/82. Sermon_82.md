*About the world and its people*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> في صفة الدنيا

In what way shall I describe this world whose beginning is grief and
whose end is
destruction?{#epub.html_fref_d30d6031_1
.see-footnote} The lawful actions performed here have to be accounted
for, while for the forbidden ones there is punishment. Whoever is rich
here faces mischief and whoever is poor gets grief. One who hankers
after it does not get it. If one keeps away from it then it advances
towards him. If one sees through it, it would bestow him sight, but if
one has his eye on it then it would blind him.

> مَا أَصِفُ مِنْ دَار أَوَّلُهَا عَنَاءٌ وَآخِرُهَا فَنَاءٌ! فِي حَلاَلِهَا حِسَابٌ، وَفِي حَرَامِهَا عِقَابٌ.
> مَنِ اسْتَغْنَى فِيهَا فُتِنَ، وَمَنِ افْتَقَرَ فِيهَا حَزِنَ، وَمَنْ سَاعَاهَا فَاتَتْهُ، وَمَنْ قَعَدَ عَنْهَا
> وَاتَتْهُ، وَمَنْ أَبْصَرَ بِهَا بَصَّرَتْهُ، وَمَنْ أَبْصَرَ إلَيْهَا أَعْمَتْهُ.

A**s-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** If a thinker thinks over this phrase of Amir
al-mu'minin "*waman absara biha bassarat'hu"* ("If one sees through it,
it would bestow him sight") he would find thereunder very amazing
meaning and far-reaching sense whose purpose cannot be appreciated and
whose aim cannot be understood particularly when he joins it with Amir
al-mu'minin's phrase *"waman absara ilayha a'mat'hu"* ("If one, has his
eye on it, them it would blind him) he would find the difference between
*"absara biha"* and *"absara laha",* clear, bright, wonderful and
shining.

> قال الشريف: أقول: وإذا تأمل المتأمل قوله (عليه السلام): «وَمَنْ أبْصَرَبِهَا
> بصّرَتْهُ» وجد تحته من المعنى العجيب، والغرض البعيد، ما لا تُبلغ غايته ولا
> يدرك غوره، لا سيما إذا قرن إليه قوله: «ومَن أبْصَرَ إليها أعْمَتْهُ»، فإنه يجد
> الفرق بين «أبصر بها» و«أبصر إليها» واضحاً نيراً عجيباً باهراً!

-  \"The beginning
    of the world is grief and its end is destruction.\" This sentence
    contains the same truth which the Qur\'an has presented in the
    verse: Indeed We have created man (to dwell) amidst hardship.
    (90:4)\
    It is true that right from the narrow womb of the mother upto the
    vastness of the firmament the changes of human life do not come to
    an end. When man first tastes life he finds himself closed in such a
    dark prison where he can neither move the limbs nor change the
    sides. When he gets rid of this confinement and steps in this world
    he has to pass through innumerable troubles. In the beginning he can
    neither speak with the tongue so as to describe his difficulty or
    pain nor possesses energy in the limbs so as to accomplish his needs
    himself. Only his suppressed sobs and flowing tears express his
    needs and translate his grief and sorrow. When after the lapse of
    this period he enters the stage of learning and instruction, then on
    every step voices of admonition and abuse welcome him. All the time
    he seems frightened and terrified. When he is relieved of this
    period of subjugation he finds himself surrounded by the worries of
    family life and livelihood, where sometimes, there is clash with
    comrades in profession, sometimes collision with enemies, sometimes
    confrontation with vicissitudes of time, sometimes attack of
    ailments and sometimes shock of children, till old age approaches
    him with the tidings of helplessness and weakness, and eventually he
    bids farewell to this world with mortification and grief in the
    heart.\
    Thereafter Amir al-mu\'minin says about this world, that in its
    lawful actions there is the question of reckoning and in its
    forbidden acts there are hardships of punishment, as a result of
    which even pleasant joys also produce bitterness in his palate. If
    there is plenty of wealth and money in this world then man finds
    himself in such a whirlpool (of worries) that he loses his joy and
    peace of mind. But if there is want and poverty, he is ever crying
    for wealth. He who hankers after this world there is no limit for
    his desires. If one wish is fulfilled the desire for fulfilment of
    another wish crops up. This world is like the reflection. If you run
    after it then it will itself run forward but if you leave it and run
    away from it then it follows you. In the same way, if a person does
    not run after the world, the world runs after him. The implication
    is that if a person breaks the clutches of greed and avarice and
    keeps aloof from undesirable hankering after the world, he too gets
    (pleasures of) the world and he does not remain deprived of it.
    Therefore, he who surveys this world from above its surface and
    takes lesson from its chances and happenings, and through its
    variation, and alterations gains knowledge about Allah\'s Might,
    Wisdom and Sagacity, Mercy, Clemency and Sustaining power, his eyes
    will gain real brightness and sight. On the other hand the person
    who is lost only in the colourfulness of the world and its
    decorations, he loses himself in the darkness of the world that is
    why Allah has forbidden to view the world thus: And strain not thine
    eyes unto that which We have provided (different) parties of them,
    (of) the splendour of the life of this world, so that We may try
    them in it; for the provision of thy Lord is better and more
    abiding. (Qur\'an, 20:131)]
