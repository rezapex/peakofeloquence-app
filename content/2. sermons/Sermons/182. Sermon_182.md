title: Sermon 182
description: 
---

It has been related by Nawf al-Bikali that Amir al-mu\'minin 'Ali
(p.b.u.h.) delivered this sermon at Kufah standing on a stone which
Ja'dah ibn Hubayrah al-Makhzumi had placed for him. Amir al-mu\'minin
had a woollen apparel on his body, the belt of his sword was made of
leaves, and the sandals on his feet too were of palm leaves. His
forehead had a hardened spot like that a camel (on its knee, due to many
and long prostrations).

## About Allah\'s attributes, His creatures and His being above physical limitations

> حمد الله واستعانته

Praise be to Allah to Whom is the return of all creation and the end of
all matters. We render Him praise for the greatness of His generosity,
the clarity of His proofs, the increase of His bounty and His favours -
praise which may fulfil His right, repay His thanks, take (us) near His
reward and be productive of increase in His kindness. We seek His help
like one who is hopeful of His bounty, desirous of His benefit, and
confident of His warding off (calamities), who acknowledges His gifts
and is obedient to Him in word and deed. We believe in Him like him who
reposes hope in Him with conviction, inclines to Him as a believer,
humbles himself before Him obediently, believes in His oneness
exclusively, regards Him great, acknowledging His dignity, and seeks
refuge with Him with inclination and exertion.

> الْحَمْدُ لله الَّذِي إلَيْهِ مَصَائِرُ الْخَلْقِ، وَعَوَاقِبُ الاْمْرِ، نَحْمَدُهُ عَلَى عَظِيمِ إِحْسَانِهِ،
> وَنَيِّرِ بُرْهَانِهِ، وَنَوَامِي فَضْلِهِ وَامْتِنَانِهِ، حَمْداً يَكُونُ لِحَقِّهِ قَضَاءً، وَلِشُكْرِهِ أَدَاءً،
> وَإلَى ثَوَابِهِ مُقَرِّباً، وَلِحُسْنِ مَزِيدِهِ مُوجِباً.

> وَنَسْتَعِينُ بِهِ اسْتِعَانَةَ رَاج لِفَضْلِهِ، مُؤَمِّل لِنَفْعِهِ، وَاثِق بِدَفْعِهِ، مُعْتَرِف لَهُ بِالطَّوْلِ،
> مُذْعِن لَهُ بِالْعَمَلِ وَالْقَوْلِ.

> وَنُؤْمِنُ بِه إِيمَانَ مَنْ رَجَاهُ مُوقِناً، وَأَنَابَ إِلَيْهِ مُؤْمِناً، وَخَنَعَ لَهُ مُذْعِناً، وَأَخْلَصَ
> لَهُ مُوَحِّداً، وَعَظَّمَهُ مُمَجِّداً، وَلاَذَ بِهِ رَاغِباً مُجْتَهِداً.

Allah the Glorified has not been born so that someone could be (His)
partner in glory. Nor has He begotten anyone so as to be inherited from
after dying. Time and period have not preceded Him. Increase and
decrease do not occur to Him. But He has manifested Himself to our
understanding through our having observed His strong control and firm
decree.

Among the proofs of His creation is the creation of the skies which are
fastened without pillars and stand without support. He called them and
they responded obediently and humbly without being lazy or loathsome. If
they had not acknowledged His Godhead and obeyed Him He would not have
made them the place for His throne, the abode of His angels and the
destination to which ascend 'the pure utterances and the righteous
deeds' (ref. 35:10) of the creatures.

> لَمْ يُولَدْ سُبْحَانَهُ فَيَكُونَ فِي الْعِزِّ مُشَارَكاً، وَلَمْ يَلِدْ فَيَكُونَ مُوْرُوثاً هَالِكاً، وَلَمْ
> يَتَقَدَّمْهُ وَقْتٌ وَلاَ زَمَانٌ، ولَمْ يَتَعَاوَرْهُ زِيَادَةٌ وَلاَ نُقْصَانٌ، بَلْ ظَهَرَ لِلْعُقُولِ بِمَا
> أَرَانَا مِنْ عَلاَمَاتِ التَّدْبِيرِ الْمُتْقَنِ، وَالْقَضَاءِ الْمُبْرَمِ.

> فَمِنْ شَوَاهِدِ خَلْقِهِ خَلْقُ السَّماوَاتِ مُوَطَّدَات بِلاَ عَمَد، قَائِمَات بِلاَ سَنَد، دَعَاهُنَّ
> فَأَجَبْنَ طَائِعَات مُذْعِنَات، غَيْرَ مُتَلَكِّئَات وَلاَ مُبْطِئَات، وَلَوْ لاَ إقْرَارُهُنَّ لَهُ
> بِالرُّبُوبِيَّةِ وَإِذْعَانُهُنَّ بِالطَّوَاعِيَةِ، لَمَا جَعَلَهُنَّ مَوْضِعاً لِعَرْشِهِ، وَلاَ مَسْكَناً
> لِمَلائِكَتِهِ، وَلاَ مَصْعَداً لِلْكَلِمِ الطَّيِّبِ وَالْعَمَلِ الصَّالِحِ مِنْ خَلْقِهِ.

He has made the stars in the skies by way of signs by which travellers
wandering the various routes of the earth may be guided. The gloom of
the dark curtains of the night does not prevent the flame of their
light, nor do the veils of blackish nights have the power to turn back
the light of the moon when it spreads in the skies. Glory be to Allah
from Whom neither the blackness of dark dusk or of gloomy night
(falling) in the low parts of the earth or on high dim mountains is
hidden, nor the thundering of clouds on the horizons of the skies, nor
the sparking of lightning in the clouds, nor the falling of leaves blown
away from their falling places by the winds of hurricanes or by downpour
from the sky. He knows where the drops fall and where they stay, where
the grubs leave their trails or where they drag themselves, what
livelihood would suffice the mosquitoes and what a female bears in its
womb.

> جَعَلَ نُجُومَهَا أَعْلاَماً يَسْتَدِلُّ بِهَا الْحَيْرَانُ فِي مُخْتَلِفِ فِجَاجِ الاْقْطَارِ، لَمْ يَمْنَعْ ضَوْءَ
> نُورِهَا ادْلِهْمَامُ سُجُفِ اللَّيْلِ الْمُظْلِمِ، وَلاَ اسْتَطَاعَتْ جَلاَبِيبُ سَوَادِ الْحَنَادِسِ أَنْ تَرُدَّ
> مَا شَاعَ فِي السَّماوَاتِ مِنْ تَلاَلُؤِ نُورِ الْقَمَرِ.

> فَسُبْحَانَ مَنْ لاَ يَخْفَى عَلَيْهِ سَوَادُ غَسَق دَاج، وَلاَ لَيْل سَاج، فِي بِقَاعِ الاْرَضِينَ
> الْمُتَطَأْطِئَاتِ، وَلاَ في يَفَاعِ السُّفْعِ الْمُتَجَاوِرَاتِ، وَمَا يَتَجَلْجَلُ بِهِ الرَّعْدُ فِي أُفُقِ
> السَّماءِ، وَمَا تَلاَشَتْ عَنْهُ بُرُوقُ الْغَمَامِ، وَمَا تَسْقُطُ مِنْ وَرَقَة تُزِيلُهَا عَنْ مَسْقَطِهَا
> عَوَاصِفُ الاْنْوَاءِ وَانْهِطَالُ السَّماءِ ! وَيَعْلَمُ مَسْقَطَ الْقَطْرَةِ وَمَقَرَّهَا، وَمَسْحَبَ الذَّرَّةِ
> وَمَجَرَّهَا، وَمَا يَكْفِي الْبَعُوضَةَ مِنْ قُوتِهَا، وَمَا تَحْمِلُ مِنْ أُنْثَى فِي بَطْنِهَا.

Praise be to Allah Who exists from before the coming into existence of
the seat, the throne, the sky, the earth, the jinn or human being. He
cannot be perceived by imagination nor measured by understanding. He who
begs from Him does not divert Him (from others), nor does giving away
cause Him diminution. He does not see by means of an eye, nor can He be
confined to a place. He cannot be said to have companions. He does not
create with (the help of) limbs. He cannot be perceived by senses. He
cannot be compared with people.

> وَالْحَمْدُ لله الْكَائِنِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَكُونَ كُرْسِيٌّ أَوْ عَرْشٌ، أَوْ سَمَاءٌ أَوْ أَرْضٌ، أَوْ جَانٌّ أَوْ
> إنْسٌ، لاَ يُدْرَكُ بِوَهْم، وَلاَ يُقَدَّرُ بِفَهْم، وَلاَ يَشْغَلُهُ سَائِلٌ، وَلاَ يَنْقُصُهُ نَائِلٌ، وَلاَ
> يَنْظُرُ بِعَيْن، وَلاَ يُحَدُّ بِأَيْن، وَلاَ يُوصَفُ بِالاْزْوَاجِ، وَلاَ يُخْلَقُ بِعِلاَج، وَلاَ يُدْركُ
> بِالْحَوَاسِّ، وَلاَ يُقَاسُ بِالنَّاسِ،

It is He who spoke to Musa clearly and showed him His great signs
without the use of bodily parts, the organ of speech or the uvula. O you
who exert yourself in describing Allah, if you are serious then (first
try to) describe Gabriel, Michael or the host of angels who are close
(to Allah) in the receptacles of sublimity; but their heads are bent
downwards and their wits are perplexed as to how to assign limits (of
definition) to the Highest Creator. This is because those things can
only be perceived through qualities which have shape and parts and which
succumb to death after reaching the end of their times. There is no god
but He. He has lighted every darkness with His effulgence and has
darkened every light with the darkness (of death).

> الَّذِي كَلَّمَ مُوسى تَكْلِيماً، وَأَرَاهُ مِنْ آيَاتِهِ عَظيماً، بِلاَ جَوَارِحَ وَلاَ أَدَوَات، وَلاَ
> نُطْق وَلاَ لَهَوَات. بَلْ إِنْ كُنْتَ صَادِقاً أَيُّهَا الْمُتَكَلِّفُ لِوَصْفِ رَبِّكَ، فَصِفْ جَبْرَئيلَ
> وَمِيكَائِيلَ وَجُنُودَ الْمَلاَئِكَةِ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ، فِي حُجُراتِ الْقُدُسِ مُرْجَحِنِّينَ، مُتَوَلِّهَةً
> عُقُولُهُمْ أَنْ يَحُدُّوا أَحْسَنَ الْخَالِقينَ. وَإنَّمَا يُدرَكُ بِالصِّفَاتِ ذَوُوالْهَيْئَاتِ وَالاْدوَاتِ،
> وَمَنْ يَنْقَضِي إِذَا بَلَغَ أَمَدَ حَدِّهِ بِالْفَنَاءِ، فَلاَ إلهَ إلاَّ هُوَ، أَضَاءَ بِنُورِهِ كُلَّ ظَلاَم،
> وَأَظْلَمَ بِظُلْمَتِهِ كُلَّ نُور.

## An account of past peoples and about learning from them

> الوصية بالتقوى

I advise you, creatures of Allah, to practise fear of Allah Who gave you
good clothing and bestowed an abundance of sustenance on you. If there
was anyone who could secure a ladder to everlasting life or a way to
avoid death it was Sulayman ibn Dawud (p. b. u. h. ) who was given
control over the domain of the jinn and men along with prophethood and
great position (before Allah), but when he finished what was his due in
food (of this world) and exhausted his (fixed) time the bow of
destruction shot him with arrow of death. His houses became vacant and
his habitations became empty. Another group of people inherited them.
Certainly, the by-gone centuries have a lesson for you.

> أُوصِيكُمْ عِبَادَ اللهِ بِتَقْوَى اللهِ الَّذِي أَلْبَسَكُمُ الرِّيَاشَ، وَأَسْبَغَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَعَاشَ;
> فَلَوْ أَنَّ أَحَداً يَجِدُ إلَى الْبَقَاءِ سُلَّماً، أَوْ لِدَفْعِ الْمَوْتِ سَبِيلاً، لَكَانَ ذلِكَ سُلَيْمانُ
> بْنُ دَاوُدَ(عليه السلام)، الَّذِي سُخِّرَ لَهُ مُلْكُ الْجِنِّ وَالاْنْسِ، مَعَ النُّبُوَّهِ وَعَظِيمِ
> الزُّلْفَةِ، فَلَمَّا اسْتَوْفَى طُعْمَتَهُ، وَاسْتَكْمَلَ مُدَّتَهُ، رَمَتْهُ قِسِيُّ الْفَنَاءِ بِنِبَالِ المَوْتِ،
> وَأَصْبَحَتِ الدِّيَارُ مِنْهُ خَالِيَةً، وَالْمَسَاكِنُ مُعَطَّلَةً، وَرِثَهَا قَوْمٌ آخَرُونَ، وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ فِي

## A part of the same sermon about the Imam al-Mahdi

> منها:

He will be wearing the armour of wisdom, which he will have secured with
all its conditions, such as full attention towards it, its (complete)
knowledge and exclusive devotion to it. For him it is like a thing which
he had lost and which he was then seeking, or a need which he was trying
to fulfil. If Islam is in trouble he will feel forlorn like a traveller
and like a (tired) camel beating the end of its tail and with its neck
flattened on the ground. He is the last of Allah\'s proofs and one of
the vicegerents of His prophets.

> قَدْ لَبِسَ لِلْحِكْمَةِ جُنَّتَهَا، وَأَخَذَهَا بِجَمِيعِ أَدَبِهَا، مِنَ الاْقْبَالِ عَلَيهَا، وَالْمَعْرِفِةِ

> بَقِيَّةٌ مِنْ بَقَايَا حُجَّتِهِ، خَلِيفَةٌ مِنْ خَلاَئِفِ أَنْبِيَائِهِ.

## On the method of his ruling, and grief over the martyrdom of his companions

Then Amir al-mu\'minin continued:

> ثم قال (عليه السلام):

O people! I have divulged to you advice which the prophets used to
preach before their peoples, and I have conveyed to you what the
vicegerents (of the prophets) conveyed to those coming after them. I
tried to train you with my whip but you could not be straightened. I
drove you with admonition but you did not acquire proper behaviour. May
Allah deal with you! Do you expect an Imam other than me to take you on
the (right) path, and show you the correct way?

> أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، إِنِّي قَدْ بَثَثْتُ لَكُمُ الْمَوَاعِظَ الَّتِي وَعَظَ بِهَا الاْنْبِيَاءُ أُمَمَهُمْ، وَأَدَّيْتُ
> إِلَيْكُمْ مَا أَدَّتِ الاْوصِيَاءُ إِلَى مَنْ بَعْدَهُمْ، وَأَدَّبْتُكُمْ بِسَوْطِي فَلَمْ تَسْتَقِيمُوا،
> وَحَدَوْتُكُمْ بالزَّوَاجِرِ فَلَمْ تَسْتَوْسِقُوا. لله أَنْتُمْ! أَتَتَوَقَّعُونَ إِمَاماً غَيْرِي يَطَأُ بِكُمُ
> الطَّرِيقَ، وَيُرْشِدُكُمُ السَّبِيلَ؟

Beware, the things in this world which were forward have become things
of the past, and those of which were behind are going ahead. The
virtuous people of Allah have made up their minds to leave and they have
purchased, with a little perishable (pleasure) of this world, a lot of
such (reward) in the next world that will remain. What loss did our
brothers whose blood was shed in Siffin suffer by not being alive today?
Only that they are not suffering choking on swallowings and not drinking
turbid water. By Allah, surely they have met Allah and He has bestowed
upon them their rewards and He has lodged them in safe houses after
their (having suffered) fear.

> أَلاَ إِنَّهُ قَدْ أَدْبَرَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا مَا كَانَ مُقْبِلاً، وَأَقْبَلَ مِنْهَا مَا كَانَ مُدْبِراً، وَأَزْمَعَ
> التَّرْحَالَ عِبَادُاللهِ الاْخْيَارُ، وَبَاعُوا قَلِيلاً مِنَ الدُّنْيَا لاَ يَبْقَى، بِكَثِير مِنَ
> الاْخِرَةِ لاَيَفْنَى. مَا ضَرَّ إِخْوَانَنَا الَّذِينَ سُفِكَتْ دِمَاؤُهُمْ ـ وَهُمْ بِصِفِّينَ ـ أَلاَّ
> يَكُونُوا الْيَوْمَ أَحْيَاءً؟ يُسِيغُونَ الْغُصَصَ، وَيَشْرَبُونَ الرَّنْقَ! قَدْ ـ وَاللهِ ـ لَقُوا
> اللهَ فَوَفَّاهُمْ أُجُورَهُمْ، وَأَحَلَّهُمْ دَارَ الاْمْنِ بَعْدَ خَوْفِهمْ.

Where are my brethren who took the (right) path and trod in rightness.
Where is 'Ammar? {#epub.html_fref_0578b193_4
.see-footnote} Where is Ibn at-Tayyihan?

Where is
Dhu\'sh-Shahadatayn?{#epub.html_fref_eea1a65e_6
.see-footnote} And where are others like
them{#epub.html_fref_fb003178_7
.see-footnote} from among their comrades who had pledged themselves to
death and whose (severed) heads were taken to the wicked enemy.

> أَيْنَ إِخْوَانِي الَّذِينَ رَكِبُوا الطَّريقَ، وَمَضَوْا عَلَى الْحَقِّ؟ أَيْنَ عَمَّارٌ؟ وَأَيْنَ ابْنُ

> الْمَنِيَّةِ، وَأُبْرِدَ بِرُؤوسِهِمْ إِلَى الْفَجَرَةِ؟

**Then Amir al-mu\'minin wiped his hand over his auspicious, honoured
beard and wept for a long time, then he continued:**

> قال: ثمّ ضرب (عليه السلام) بيده إلى لحيته، فأطال البكاء، ثمّ قال:

Oh my brothers who recited the Qur\'an and strengthened it, thought over
their obligation and fulfilled it, revived the *sunnah* and destroyed
innovation! When they were called to *jihad* they responded and trusted
in their leader then followed him.

> أَوْهِ عَلَى إِخْوَانِي الَّذِينَ تَلَوُا الْقُرْآنَ فَأَحْكَمُوهُ، وَتَدَبَّرُوا الْفَرْضَ فَأَقَامُوهُ، أَحْيَوُا
> السُّنَّةَ، وَأمَاتُوا الْبِدْعَةَ، دُعُوا لِلْجِهَادِ فَأَجَابُوا، وَوَثِقُوا بِالْقَائِدِ فَاتَّبَعُوا.

**Then Amir al-mu\'minin shouted at the top of his voice:**

> ثمّ نادى بأعلى صوته:

*Al-jihad, al-jihad* (fighting, fighting), O creatures of Allah! By
Allah, I am mobilising the army today. He who desires to proceed towards
Allah should come forward.

> الْجِهَادَ الْجِهَادَ عِبَادَ اللهِ! أَلاَ وَإِنِّي مُعَسْكِرٌ فِي يَوْمي هذَا، فَمَنْ أَرَادَ الرَّوَاحَ
> إِلَى اللهِ فَلْيَخْرُجْ.

**Nawf said:** Then Amir al-mu\'minin put Husayn (p.b.u.h.) over (a
force of) ten thousand, Qays ibn Sa'd (mercy of Allah be upon him) over
ten thousand, Abu Ayyub al-Ansari over ten thousand, and others over
different numbers, intending to return to Siffin, but Friday did not
appear again and the accursed Ibn Muljam (may Allah curse him) killed
him. Consequently, the armies came back and were left like sheep who had
lost their shepherd while wolves were snatching them away from all
sides.

> قال نوْفٌ: وعقد للحسين(عليه السلام) في عشرة آلاف، ولقيس بن سعد في عشرة

-  History shows
    that very often the ruin and destruction of peoples has been due to
    their oppression and open wickedness and profligacy. Consequently,
    communities which had extended their sway over all the corners of
    the populated world and had flown their flags in the East and West
    of the globe disappeared from the surface of the earth like a wrong
    word, on disclosure of their vicious actions and evil doings.\
    Amalekites: ancient nomadic tribe, or collection of tribes,
    described in the Old Testament as relentless enemies of Israel, even
    though they were closely related to Ephraim, one of the twelve
    tribes of Israel. Their name derives from Amalek, who is celebrated
    in Arabian tradition but cannot be identified. The district over
    which they ranged was south of Judah and probably extended into
    northern Arabia. The Amalekites harassed the Hebrews during their
    exodus out of Egypt and attacked them at Rephidim (near Mt. Sinai),
    where they were defeated by Joshua. They also filled out the ranks
    of the nomadic raiders defeated by Gideon and were condemned to
    annihilation by Samuel. The Amelekites, whose final defeat occurred
    in the time of Hezekiah, were the object of a perpetual curse. (The
    New Encyclopaedia Britannica \[Micropaedia\], vol. 1, p. 288, ed.
    1973-1974; also see \[for further reference\] The Encyclopaedia
    Americana, \[International Edition\] vol. 1, p. 651, ed.
    1975).]

-  Pharaoh: Hebrew
    form of the Egyptian per-\'o (\"the great house\"), signifying the
    royal palace, an epithet applied in the New Kingdom and after, as a
    title of respect, to the Egyptian king himself. In the 22nd dynasty
    the title was added to the king\'s personal name. In official
    documents the full titulary of the Egyptian king contained five
    names. The first and oldest identified him as the incarnation of the
    falcon god, Horus; it was often written inside a square called
    serekh, depicting the facade of the archaic palace. The second name,
    \"two ladies\", placed him under the protection of Nekhbet and Buto,
    the vulture and uraeus (snake) goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt;
    the third, \"golden Horus\", signified perhaps originally \"Horus
    victorious over his enemies.\" The last two names, written within a
    ring or cartouche, are generally referred to as the praenomen and
    nomen, and were the ones most commonly used; the praenomen and
    nomen, and were the ones most commonly used; the praenomen, preceded
    by the hieroglyph meaning \"King of Upper and Lower Egypt,\" usually
    contained a reference to the king\'s Unique relationship with the
    sun god, Re, while the fifth, or nomen, was preceded by the
    hieroglyph for \"Son of Re,\" or by that for \"Lord of the two
    lands.\" The last name was given him at birth, the rest at his
    coronation. (The New Encyclopaedia Britannica \[Micropaedia\], vol.
    Vll, p. 927, ed. 1973-1974; also see \[for further reference\] The
    Encyclopaedia Americana, \[International Edition\], vol. 21, p. 707,
    ed. 1975).\
    Among the Pharaohs was the Pharaoh of the days of Prophet Musa. His
    pride, egotism, insolence and haughtiness were such that by making
    the claim \"I am your sublime God\" he deemed himself to be holding
    sway over all other powers of the world, and was under the
    misunderstanding that no power could wrest the realm and government
    from his hands. The Qur\'an has narrated his claim of \"I and no one
    else\" in the following words:\
    And proclaimed Pharaoh unto his people, \"O\' my people! is not the
    kingdom of Egypt mine? And these rivers flow below me; What! behold
    ye not? (43:51)\
    But when his empire came near the end it was destroyed in a few
    moments. Neither his position and servants could come in the way of
    its destruction nor could the vastness of his realm prevent it.
    Rather, the waves of the very streams which he was extremely proud
    to possess, wrapped him in and dispatched his spirit to Hell
    throwing the body on the bank to serve as a lesson for the whole of
    creation.]

-  The people of the
    cities of ar-Rass: In the same way the people of ar-Rass were killed
    and destroyed for disregarding the preaching and call of a prophet,
    and for revolt and disobedience. About them the Qur\'an says:\
    And the (tribes of) \`Ad and Thamud and the inhabitants of ar-Rass,
    and generations between them, in great number. And unto each of them
    We did give examples and every one (of them) We did destroy with
    utter extermination. (25:38,39)\
    Belied (also) those before them the people of Noah and the dwellers
    of ar-Rass and Thamud; And \`Ad and Pharaoh, and the brethren of
    Lot; And the dwellers of the Wood and the people of Tubba\`; all
    belied the apostles, so was proved true My promise (of the doom)
    (50:12-14)]

-  \`Ammar ibn Yasir
    ibn \`Amir al-\`Ansi al-Madhhiji al Makhzumi (a confederate of Banu
    Makhzum) was one of the earliest converts to Islam, and the first
    Muslim to build a mosque in his own house in which he used to
    worship Allah (at-Tabaqat, vol. 3, Part 1, p. 178; Usd al-ghabah,
    vol. 4, p. 46; Ibn Kathir, at-Tarikh, vol. 7, p. 311).\
    \`Ammar accepted Islam along with his father Yasir and his mother
    Sumayyah. They suffered great tortures by the Quraysh, due to their
    conversion to Islam, to such an extent that \`Ammar lost his
    parents; and they were the first martyrs man and woman in Islam.\
    \`Ammar was among those who immigrated to Abyssinia, and the
    earliest immigrants (muhajirun) to Medina. He was present in the
    battle of Badr and all other battles as well as places of assembly
    by the Muslims during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet; and he
    showed his might and favour in all Islamic struggles in the best
    way.\
    Many traditions are narrated from the Holy Prophet about \`Ammar
    regarding his virtues, outstanding traits and his glorious deeds,
    such as the tradition which \`A\'ishah and other have narrated that
    the Holy Prophet himself had said that \`Ammar was filled with faith
    from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet. (Ibn Majah,
    as-Sunan, vol. 1, p. 65; Abu Nu\`aym, Hilyah al-Awliya\', vol. 1, p.
    139; al-Haytami, Majma\` az-zawa\'id, vol. 9, p. 295; al-Isti\`ab,
    vol. 3, p. 1137; al-Isabah, vol. 2, p. 512)\
    In another tradition the Holy Prophet said about \`Ammar:\
    \`Ammar is with the truth and the truth is with \`Ammar. He turns
    wherever the truth turns. \`Ammar is as near to me as an eye is near
    to the nose. Alas! a rebellious group will kill him. (at-Tabaqat,
    vol. 3, part 1, p. 187; al-Mustadrak, vol. 3, p. 392; Ibn Hisham,
    as-Sirah, vol. 2, p. 143; Ibn Kathir, at-Tarikh, vol. 7, pp.
    268-270)\
    Also in the decisive and widely known tradition which al-Bukhari (in
    Sahih, vol. 8, pp. 185-186), at-Tirmidhi (in al-Jami\` as-Sahih,
    vol. 5, p. 669); Ahmad ibn Hanbal (in al-Musnad, vol. 2, pp.
    161,164,206; vol. 3, pp.5, 22, 28, 91; vol. 4, pp.197, 199, vol. 5
    pp.215, 306, 307; vol. 6, pp.289, 300, 311, 315), and all the
    narrators of Islamic traditions and historians transmitted through
    twenty-five Companions that the Holy Prophet said about \`Ammar:\
    Alas! a rebellious group which swerves from the truth will murder
    \`Ammar. \`Ammar will be calling them towards Paradise and they will
    be calling him towards Hell. His killer and those who strip him of
    arms and clothing will be in Hell.\
    Ibn Hajar al-\`Asqalani (in Tahdhib at-tahdhib, vol. 7, p. 409;
    al-lsabah, vol. 2, p.512) and as-Suyuti (in al-Khasa\'is al-kubra,
    vol. 2, p. 140) say: \"The narration of this (above mentioned)
    tradition is mutawatir (i.e. narrated successively by so many people
    that no doubt can be entertained about its authenticity).\"\
    Ibn \`Abd al-Barr (in al-Isti\`ab, vol. 3, p. 1140) says:\
    The narration followed uninterrupted succession from the Holy
    Prophet, that he said: \"A rebellious group will murder \`Ammar,\"
    and this is a prophecy of the Prophet\'s secret knowledge and the
    sign of his prophethood. This tradition is among the most authentic
    and the most rightly ascribed traditions.]

    After the death of the Holy Prophet, \`Ammar was one of the closest
    adherents and best supporters of Amir al-mu\'minin during the reign
    of the first three Caliphs. During the caliphate of \`Uthman when
    the Muslim protested (to \`Uthman) against his policy on the
    distribution of the Public Treasury (Baytu\'l-mal) \`Uthman said in
    a public assembly that, \'the money which as in the treasury was
    sacred and belonged to Allah, and that he (as being the successor of
    the Prophet) had the right to dispose of them as he thought fit.
    \'He (\`Uthman) threatened and cursed all who presumed to censure or
    murmur at what he said. Upon this, \`Ammar ibn Yasir boldly declared
    his disapprobation and began to charge him with his inveterate
    propensity to ignore the interests of the general public; accused
    him with reviving the heathenish customs abolished by the Prophet.
    Whereupon \`Uthman commanded him to be beaten and immediately some
    of the Umayyads, the kindred of the Caliph fell upon the venerable
    \`Ammar, and the Caliph himself kicking him with his shoes (on his
    feet) on \`Ammar\'s testicles, and afflicted him with hernia.
    \`Ammar became unconscious for three days, and he was taken care of
    by Umm al-mu\'minin Umm Salamah in her own house. (al-Baladhuri,
    Ansab al-ashraf, vol. 5, pp. 48,54,88; Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid, vol. 3, pp.
    47-52; al-lmamah wa\'s-siyasah, vol. 1, pp. 35-36; al-\`Iqd
    al-farid, vol. 4, p. 307; at-Tabaqat, vol. 3, Part 1, p. 185; Tarikh
    al-khamis, vol. 2, p. 271)\
    When Amir al-mu\'minin became Caliph, \`Ammar was one of his most
    sincere supporters. He participated fully in all social, political
    and military activities during this period, especially in the first
    battle (the battle of Jamal) and the second one (the battle of
    Siffin).\
    However, \`Ammar was martyred on 9th Safar 37 A.H. in the battle of
    Siffin when a he was over ninety years of age. On the day \`Ammar
    ibn Yasir achieved martyrdom, he turned his face to the sky and
    said:\
    O My God! Surely Thou art aware that if I know that Thy wish is that
    I should plunge myself into this River (the Euphrates) and be
    drowned, I will do it. O My God! Surely Thou knowest that if I knew
    that Thou would be pleased if I put my scimitar on my chest (to hit
    my heart) and pressed it so hard that it came out of my back, I
    would do it. O My God! I do not think there is anything more
    pleasant to Thee than fighting against this sinful group, and if I
    knew that any action were more pleasant to Thee I would do it.\
    Abu \`Abd ar-Rahman as-Sulami narrates:\
    \"We were present with Amir al-mu\'minin at Siffin where I saw
    \`Ammar ibn Yasir was not turning his face towards any side, nor
    valleys (wadis \[of the land\] ) of Siffin but the companions of the
    Holy Prophet were following him as if he was a sign for them. Then I
    heard \`Ammar say to Hashim ibn \'Utbah (al-Mirqal): \'O Hashim!
    Rush into enemy\'s ranks, paradise is under the sword!\
    Today I meet my beloved one, Muhammad and his party\'.\
    \"Then he said: \'By Allah, if they put us to flight (and pursue us)
    to the date-palms of Hajar (a town in Bahrain, Persian Gulf \[i.e.,
    if they pursue us along all the Arabian desert\] nevertheless) we
    know surely that we are right and they are wrong.\'\
    \"Then he (Ammar) continued (addressing the enemies):\
    We struck you to (believe in) its (Holy Qur\'an) revelation; And
    today we strike you to (believe in) its interpretation; Such strike
    as to remove heads from their resting places; And to make the friend
    forget his sincere friend; Until the truth returns to its (right)
    path.\'\"\
    The narrator says: \"I did not see the Holy Prophet\'s companions
    killed at any time as many as they were killed on this day.\"\
    Then \`Ammar spurred his horse, entered the battlefield and began
    fighting. He persistently chased the enemy, made attack after
    attack, and raised challenging slogans till at last a group of
    mean-spirited Syrians surrounded him on all sides, and a man named
    Abu al-Ghadiyah al-Juhari (al-Fazari) inflicted such a wound upon
    him that he could not bear it, and returned to his camp. He asked
    for water. A tumbler of milk was brought to him. When \`Ammar looked
    at the tumbler he said: \"The Messenger of Allah had said the right
    thing.\" People asked him what he meant by these words. He said
    \"The Messenger of Allah informed me that the last sustenance for me
    in this world would be milk.\" Then he took that tumbler of milk in
    his hands, drank the milk and surrendered his life to Allah, the
    Almighty. When Amir al-mu\'minin came to know of his death, he came
    to \`Ammar\'s side, put his (\`Ammar\'s) head on his own lap, and
    recited the following elegy to mourn his death:\
    Surely any Muslim who is not distressed at the murder of the son of
    Yasir, and is not be afflicted by this grievous misfortune does not
    have true faith.\
    May Allah show His mercy to \`Ammar the day he embraced Islam, may
    Allah show His mercy to \`Ammar the day he was killed, and may Allah
    show His mercy to \`Ammar the day he is raised to life.\
    Certainly, I found \`Ammar (on such level) that three companions of
    the Holy Prophet could not be named unless he was the fourth, and
    four of them could not be mentioned unless he was the fifth.\
    There was none among the Holy Prophet\'s companions who doubted that
    not only was Paradise once or twice compulsorily bestowed upon
    \`Ammar, but that he gained his claim to it (a number of times). May
    Paradise give enjoyment to \`Ammar.\
    Certainly, it was said (by the Holy Prophet) \"Surely, \`Ammar is
    with the truth and the truth is with \`Ammar. He turns wherever the
    truth turns. His killer will be in hell.\"\
    Then Amir al-mu\'minin stepped forward and offered funeral prayers
    for him, and then with his own hands, he buried him with his
    clothes.\
    \`Ammar\'s death caused a good deal of commotion in the ranks of
    Mu\`awiyah too, because there were a large number of prominent
    people fighting from his side under the impression created in their
    minds that he was fighting Amir al-mu\'minin for a right cause.
    These people were aware of the saying of the Holy Prophet that
    \`Ammar would be killed by a group who would be on the wrong side.
    When they observed that \`Ammar had been killed by Mu\`awiyah\'s
    army, they became convinced that they were on the wrong side and
    that Amir al-mu\'minin was definitely on the right. This agitation
    thus caused among the leaders as well as the rank and file of
    Mu\`awiyah\'s army, was quelled by him with the argument that it was
    Amir al-mu\'minin who brought \`Ammar to the battlefield and
    therefore it was he who was responsible for his death. When
    Mu\`awiyah\'s argument was mentioned before Amir al-mu\'minin he
    said it was as though the Prophet was responsible for killing Hamzah
    as he brought him to the battle of Uhud. (at-Tabari, at-Tarikh, vol.

-  Abu\'l-Haytham
    (Malik) ibn at-Tayyihan al-Ansari was one of the twelve chiefs
    (naqib \[of Ansar\]) who attended the fair and met at al-\`Aqabah
    \-- in the first \`Aqabah and among those who attended in the second
    \`Aqabah \-- where he gave the Holy Prophet the \'pledge of Islam\'.
    He was present in the battle of Badr and all other battles as well
    as places of assembly by the Muslims during the lifetime of the Holy
    Prophet. He was also among the sincere supporters of Amir
    al-mu\'minin and he attended the battle of Jamal as well as Siffin
    where he was martyred. (al-Isti\`ab, vol. 4, p. 1773; Siffin, p.
    365; Usd al-ghabah, vol. 4, p. 274; vol. 5, p. 318; al-Isabah, vol.
    3, p. 341; vol. 4, pp. 312-313; Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid, vol. 10, pp.
    107-108; Ansab al-ashraf, p. 319).]

-  Khuzaymah ibn
    Thabit al-Ansari. He is known as Dhu\'sh-Shahadatayn because the
    Holy Prophet considered his evidence equivalent to the evidence of
    two witnesses He was present in the battle of Badr, and other
    battles as well as in the places of assembly of the Muslims during
    the lifetime of the Holy Prophet. He is counted among the earliest
    of those who showed their adherence to Amir al-mu\'minin and he was
    also present in the battle of Jamal and Siffin. \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn
    Abi Layla narrated that he saw a man in the battle of Siffin
    fighting the enemy valiantly and when he protested against his
    action, the man said:\
    I am Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al-Ansari, I have heard the Holy Prophet
    saying \"Fight, fight, by the side of \`Ali.\" (al-Khatib
    al-Baghdadi, Muwaddih awham al-jam\` wa\'t-tafriq, vol. 1, p. 277).\
    Khuzaymah was martyred in the battle of Siffin soon after the
    martyrdom of \`Ammar ibn Yasir.\
    Sayf ibn \`Umar al-Usayydi (the well known liar) has fabricated
    another Khuzaymah, and claimed that the one who was martyred in the
    battle of Siffin was this one and not the one with the surname of
    \'Dhu\'sh-Shahadatayn\'. at-Tabari has quoted this fabricated story
    from Sayf either intentionally or otherwise, and through him this
    story has affected some other historians who quoted from at-Tabari
    or relied on him. (For further reference, see al-\`Askari, Khamsun
    wa miah sahabi mukhtalaq \[one hundred and fifty fabricated
    companions\], vol. 2, pp. 175-189).\
    After having denied this story Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid adds (in Sharh
    Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 10, pp. 109-110) that:\
    Furthermore, what is the need for those who want to defend Amir
    al-mu\'minin to make a boast of abundance with Khuzaymah,
    Abu\'l-Haytham, \`Ammar and others. If people treat this man (Amir
    al-mu\'minin) with justice and look at him with healthy eyes they
    will certainly realise that should he be alone (on one side) and the
    people all together (on the other side) fighting him, he will be in
    the truth and all the rest will be in the wrong. (at-Tabaqat, vol.
    3, Part 1, pp. 185,188; al-Mustadrak, vol. 3, pp. 385, 397; Usd
    al-ghabah, vol. 2, p. 114; vol. 4, p. 47; al-lsti\`ab, vol. 2, p.
    448; at-Tabari, vol. 3, pp.2316, 2319, 2401; al-Kamil, vol. 3, p.
    325; Siffin, pp. 363, 398; Ansab al-ashraf, pp.
    313-314).]

-  Among the people
    who were present in the battle of Jamal on the side of Amir
    al-muminin there were one hundred and thirty Badries (those who
    participated in the battle of Badr with the Holy Prophet) and seven
    hundred of those who were present in the \'pledge of ar-Ridwan\'
    (Bay\`atu\'r-Ridwan) which took place under a tree. (adh-Dhahabi,
    Tarikh al-lslam, vol. 2, p. 171; Khalifah ibn Khayyat, at-Tarikh
    vol. 1, p. 164). Those who were killed in the battle of Jamal from
    the side of Amir al-muminin numbered some five hundred (some said
    that the number of martyrs were more than that). But on the side of
    the people of Jamal twenty thousand were killed. (al-\`lqd al-farid,
    vol. 4, p. 326).\
    Among those who were present in the battle of Siffin on the side of
    Amir al-mu\'minin, there were eighty Badries and eight hundred of
    those who gave the Holy Prophet the \'pledge of ar-Ridwan.\'
    (al-Mustadrak, vol. 3, p. 104 al-Isti\`a\'b, vol. 3, p. 1138;
    al-Isabah, vol. 2, p. 389; at-Tarikh, al-Ya\`qubi, vol. 2, p. 188).\
    On the side of Mu\`awiyah forty-five thousand were killed, and on
    the side of Amir al-muminin twenty-five thousand. Among these
    martyrs (of Amir al-mu\'minin) there were twenty-five or twenty-six
    Badries and sixty-three or three hundred and three of the people of
    the \'pledge of ar-Ridwan\'. (Siffin, p. 558; al-Isti\`ab, vol.
    2, p. 389, Ansab al-ashraf, p. 322; Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid, vol. 10, p.
    104; Abu\'l-Fida\' vol. 1, p. 175, Ibn al-Wardi, at-Tarikh, vol.
    1, p. 240; Ibn Kathir, vol. 7, p. 275; Tarikh al-khamis, vol. 2, p.
    277)\
    Besides the distinguished and eminent companions of Amir
    al-mu\'minin like \`Ammar, Dhu\'sh-Shahadatayn and Ibn al-Tayyihan,
    those who lay martyred in Siffin were:\--\
    Hashim ibn \`Utbah ibn Abi Waqqas al-Mirqal was killed on the same
    day when \`Ammar was martyred. He was the bearer of the standard of
    Amir al-mu\'minin\'s army on that day.\
    Abdullah ibn Budayl ibn al-Warqa\' al-Khuza\`i was sometimes the
    right wing Commander of Amir al-muminin\'s army and sometimes the
    infantry Commander.]
