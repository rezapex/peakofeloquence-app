*About important future events in Basrah*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> وهو ممّا كان يخبر به عن الملاحم بالبصرة

O Ahnaf! It is as though I see him advancing with an army which has
neither dust nor noise, nor rustling of reins, nor neighing of horses.
They are trampling the ground with their feet as if they are the feet of
ostriches.

> يَا أَحْنَفُ، كَأَنِّي بِهِ وَقَدْ سَارَ بِالْجَيْشِ الَّذِي لاَ يَكُونُ لَهُ غُبَارٌ وَلاَ لَجَبٌ، وَلاَ
> قَعْقَعَةُ لُجُم، وَلاَ حَمْحَمَةُ خَيْل، يُثِيرُونَ الاْرْضَ بِأَقْدَامِهِمْ كَأَنَّهَا أَقْدَامُ النَّعَامِ.

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** Amir al-mu\'minin pointed to the Chief of
the Negroes,
(*Sahibu\'z-Zanj*).{#epub.html_fref_01140476_1
.see-footnote}

> يومىء بذلك (عليه السلام) إلى صاحب الزّنْج.

Then Amir al -mu\'minin said:

Woe to you (the people of Basrah's) inhabited streets and decorated
houses which possess wings like the wings of vultures and trunks like
the trunks of elephants; they are the people from among whom if one is
killed he is not mourned and if one is lost he is not searched for. I
turn this world over on its face, value it only according to its (low)
value, and look at it with an eye suitable to it.

> ثمّ قال (عليه السلام): وَيْلٌ لِسِكَكِكُمُ الْعَامِرَةِ، وَدُورِكُمُ الْمُزَخْرَفَةِ الَّتِي لَهَا
> أَجْنِحَةٌ كَأَجْنَحَةِ النُّسُورِ، وَخَرَاطِيمُ كَخَرَاطِيمِ الْفِيَلَةِ، مِنْ أُولئِكَ الَّذِينَ لاَ يُنْدَبُ
> قَتِيلُهُمْ، وَلاَ يُفْقَدُ غَائِبُهُمْ. أَنَا كَابُّ الدُّنْيَا لِوَجْهِهَا، وَقَادِرُهَا بِقَدْرِهَا،
> وَنَاظِرُهَا بِعَيْنِهَا.

## A part of the same sermon referring to the Turks (Mongols)

> منه: ويومئ به إلى وصف الاتراك

I 
can see a people whose faces are like shields covered with rough-scraped
skins. They dress themselves in silken and woollen clothes and hold dear
excellent horses. Their killing and bloodshed shall take place freely
till the wounded shall walk over the dead and the number of runners-away
shall be less than those taken prisoner:

> كَأَنِّي أَرَاهُمْ قَوْماً كَأَنَّ وَجُوهَهُمُ الْـمَجَانُّ الْمُطَرَّقَةُ، يَلْبَسُونَ السَّرَقَ وَالدِّيبَاجَ،
> وَيَعْتَقِبُونَ الْخَيْلَ الْعِتَاقَ، وَيَكُونُ هُنَاكَ اسْتِحْرَارُ قَتْل،حَتَّى يَمْشِيَ الْـمَجْرُوحُ عَلَى
> الْمَقْتُولِ، وَيَكُونَ الْمُفْلِتُ أَقَلَّ مِنَ المَأْسُورِ!

**One of his companions said to him:** O Amir al-mu\'minin, you have
been given knowledge of hidden things. Whereupon Amir al-mu\'minin
laughed and said to the man who belonged to the tribe of Banu Kalb:

> فقال له بعض أصحابه: لقد أَعطيت يا أميرالمؤمنين علم الغيب! فضحك (عليه
> السلام)، وقال للرجل ـ وكان كلبياً ـ :

O brother of Kalb! This is not knowledge of hidden things
(*'ilmu\'l-ghayb*),

these matters have been acquired from him (namely in Prophet) who knew
them. As regard knowledge of hidden things, that means knowledge of the
Day of Judgement, and the things covered by Allah in the verse:

**"** ***Verily, Allah is He with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour; He
sends down the rain, and He knows what is in the wombs. No soul knows
what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul knows in what land it will
die.."*** **(Qur\'an, 31:34)**

Therefore, Allah alone knows what is there in the wombs, whether male or
female, ugly or handsome, generous or miserly, mischievous or pious, and
who will be the fuel for Hell and who will be in the company of the
Prophets in Paradise. This is the knowledge of the hidden things which
is not known to anyone save Allah. All else is that whose knowledge
Allah passed on to His Prophet and he passed it on to me, and prayed for
me that my bosom may retain it and my ribs may hold it.

> يَا أَخَا كَلْب، لَيْسَ هُوَ بِعِلْمِ غَيْب، وَإِنَّمَا هُوَ تَعَلُّمٌ مِنْ ذِي عِلْم، وَإِنَّمَا عِلْمُ الْغَيْبِ
> عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ، وَمَا عَدَّدَهُ اللهُ سُبْحَانَهُ بِقَوْلِهِ: (إِنَّ اللهَ عِنْدَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ وَ

-  \`Ali ibn
    Muhammad was born in the village of Warzanin in the suburbs of Ray
    and belonged to the Azariqah sect of the Kharijites. He claimed to
    be a sayyid (descendant of the Holy Prophet) by showing himself the
    son of Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Mukhtafi ibn \`Isa ibn Zayd ibn \`Ali
    ibn al-Husayn ibn \`Ali ibn Abi Talib, but the experts on lineality
    and biographers have not accepted his claim to being a sayyid and
    have given his father\'s name as Muhammad ibn \`Abd ar-Rahim instead
    of Muhammad ibn Ahmad. The former was from the tribe of \`Abd
    al-Qays and had been born of a Sindi maid-slave. \`Ali ibn Muhammad
    rose as an insurgent in 255 A.H. in the reign of al-Muhtadi Billah
    and associated with him the people from the suburbs of Basrah on
    promise of money, wealth and freedom. He entered Basrah on the 17th
    Shuwwal, 255 A.H. killing and looting, and in only two days he put
    to death thirty thousand individuals, men, women and children, and
    displayed extreme oppression, bloodshed, savageness and ferocity. He
    dismantled houses, burnt mosques, and after continuous killing and
    devastation for fourteen years, was killed in the month of Safar,
    270 A.H. in the reign of Muwaffaq Billah. Then people got rid of his
    devastating deeds.\
    Amir al-mu\'minin\'s prophecy is one of those prophecies which throw
    light on his knowledge of the unknown. The details of his army given
    by Amir al-mu\'minin namely that there would be neither neighing of
    horses nor rustling of weapons therein is a historical fact. The
    historian at-Tabari has written that when this man reached near
    al-Karkh (a sector of Baghdad) with the intention of insurrection,
    the people of that place welcomed him, and a man presented him a
    horse for which no rein could be found despite a search. At last he
    rode it using a rope for the rein. Similarly there were at that time
    only three swords in his force - one with himself, one with \`Ali
    ibn Aban al-Muhallabi, and one with Muhammad ibn Salm, but later
    they collected some more weapons by
    marauding.]
-  This prophecy of
    Amir al-mu\'minin is about the attack of the Tartars (Mongols) who
    were inhabitants of the Mongolian desert in the north west of
    Turkistan. These semi-savage tribes lived by marauding, killing and
    devastating. They used to fight among themselves and attack
    neighbouring areas. Each tribe had a separate chief who was deemed
    responsible for their protection. Chingiz Khan (Temujin) who was one
    of the ruling chiefs of these tribes and was very brave and
    courageous had risen to organise all their divided tribes into one,
    and, despite their opposition he succeeded in overpowering them
    through his might and sagacity. Collecting a large number under his
    banner he rose in 606 A.H. like a torrent and went on dominating
    cities and ruining populations till he conquered the area upto North
    China.\
    When his authority was established he offered his terms of
    settlement to \`Alau\'d-Din Khwarazm Shah, ruler of the neighbouring
    country of Turkistan, and through a deputation concluded an
    agreement with him that the Tartar traders would be allowed to visit
    his country for trade and their life and property would not be
    subject to any harm. For some time they traded freely without fear
    but on one occasion \`Alau\'d-Din accused them of spying, seized
    their goods and had them killed by the Chief of Atrar. When Chingiz
    Khan learnt of the breach of the agreement and the killing of Tartar
    merchants his eyes cast forth flames and he began trembling with
    rage.\
    He sent word to \`Alau\'d-Din to return the goods of the Tartar
    merchants and to hand over to him the ruler of Atrar. \`Alau\'d-Din,
    who was mad with power and authority, did not pay any heed, and
    acting short-sightedly killed even the plenipotentiary of Chingiz
    Khan. Now Chingiz Khan lost all patience and his eyes filled with
    blood. He rose with his sword in hand, and the Tartar warriors leapt
    towards Bukhara on their speedy stallions. \`Alau\'d-Din came out
    with four hundred thousand combatants to face him but could not
    resist the incessant assaults of the Tartars, and having been
    vanquished only after a few attacks ran away to Nishabur across the
    river Jaxartes (Sihun). The Tartars smashed Bukhara and razed it to
    the ground. They pulled down schools and mosques, burning to ashes
    the houses and killing men and women without distinction. Next year
    they assaulted Samarqand and devastated it completely. After the
    flight of \`Alau\'d-Din, his son Jalalu\'d-Din Khwarazm Shah had
    assumed the reins of government The Tartars chased him also, and for
    ten years he fled from one place to the other but did not fall in
    their hands. At last he crossed over the river out of the boundaries
    of his realm. During this time the Tartars did their utmost to ruin
    populated lands and to annihilate humanity. No city escaped their
    ruining and no populace could avoid their trampling. Wherever they
    went they upset the kingdom, overthrew governments, and in a short
    time established their authority over the northern portion of Asia.
    When Chingiz Khan died in 622 A.H. his own son Ogedei Khan succeeded
    him. He searched out Jalalu\'d-Din in 628 A.H. and killed him. After
    him Mongka Khan, the son of the other son of Chingiz Khan, occupied
    the throne. After Mongka Khan, Qubilai Khan succeeded to a part of
    the country and the control of Asia fell to the share of his brother
    Hulagu Khan. On the division of the whole realm among the grandsons
    of Chingiz Khan, Hulagu Khan was thinking of conquering Muslims
    areas when the Hanafite of Khurasan in enmity with the Shafi\`ite
    invited him to attack Khurasan. He therefore led an assault on
    Khurasan, and the Hanafite, thinking themselves to be safe from the
    Tartars, opened the city gates for them. But the Tartars did not
    make any distinction between Hanafite and Shafi\`ite and killed
    whoever fell to their hands. After killing most of its population
    they took it in occupation. These very differences between the
    Hanafite and the Shafi\`ite opened for him the door of conquest upto
    Iraq. Consequently, after conquering Khurasan his courage increased
    and in 656 A.H. he marched on Baghdad with two hundred thousand
    Tartars. Al-Musta\`sim Billah\'s army and the people of Baghdad
    jointly faced them, but it was not in their power to stop this
    torrent of calamity. The result was that the Tartars entered Baghdad
    on the day of \`Ashura\' carrying with them bloodshed and ruin. They
    remained busy in killing for forty days. Rivers of blood flowed in
    the streets and all the alleys were filled with dead bodies. Hundred
    of thousands of people were put to the sword while al-Musta\`sim
    Billah was trampled to death under foot. Only those people who hid
    themselves in wells or underground places and hid from their sight
    could survive. This was the devastation of Baghdad which shook the
    \`Abbasid Kingdom to its foundation, so that its flag could never
    fly thereafter.\
    Some historians have laid the blame of this ruin on Ibn al-\`Alqami
    (Abu Talib, Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Baghdadi), the minister of
    al-Musta\`sim Billah, by holding that, moved by the general masses
    of the Shi\`ahs and the ruin of al-Karkh sector (of Baghdad), he
    invited Hulagu Khan through the latter\'s minister, the great
    scholar Nasiru\'d-Din Muhammad ibn Muhammad at-Tusi, to march on
    Baghdad. Even if it be so, it is not possible to ignore the
    historical fact that before this the \`Abbasid Caliph an-Nasir
    Lidini\'llah had initiated the move for the attack on the Muslim
    areas. When the Khwarazm Shahs declined to acknowledge the authority
    of the Caliphate he had sent word to Chingiz Khan to march on
    Khwarazm, from which the Tartars had understood that there was no
    unity and co-operation among the Muslims. Thereafter the Hanafite
    had sent for Hulagu Khan to crush the Shafi\`ite as a consequence of
    which the Tartars secured control over Khurasan, and prepared the
    way to march towards Baghdad. In these circumstances to hold only
    Ibn al-\`Alqami responsible for the ruination of Baghdad and to
    ignore the move of an-Nasir Lidini\'llah and the dispute between the
    Hanafite and the Shafi\`ite would be covering up the facts, when in
    fact the cause for the ruin of Baghdad was this very conquest of
    Khurasan, whose real movers were the Hanafite inhabitants of the
    place. It was by this conquest that Hulagu Khan had the courage to
    march on the centre of Islam; otherwise it cannot have been the
    result of a single individual\'s message that he assaulted an old
    capital like Baghdad, the awe of whose power and grandeur was seated
    in the hearts of a large part of the
    world.]
-  To know hidden
    things on a personal level is one thing, while to be gifted by Allah
    with knowledge of any matter and to convey it to others is
    different. The knowledge of the future which the prophets and
    vicegerents possess is gained by them through Allah\'s teaching and
    informing. Allah alone has knowledge of events which are to happen
    in the future. Of course, He passes this knowledge on to whoever He
    wills. Thus He says:\
    (He alone is) the \"Knower of the unseen, neither doth He reveal His
    secrets unto any (one else) save unto that one of the Messengers
    whom He chooseth\...\" (Qur\'an, 72:26-27)\
    In this way Amir al-mu\'minin also received knowledge of the future
    through the instructions of the Prophet or inspiration from Allah,
    for which these words of Amir al-mu\'minin stand evidence. Of
    course, sometimes it is not proper or expedient to disclose certain
    matters and they are allowed to remain under a veil. Then no one can
    be acquainted with them as Allah says: Verily, Allah is He with Whom
    is the knowledge of the Hour and He sendeth down the rain, and
    knoweth He what is in the wombs; and knoweth not any soul what he
    shall earn the morrow, and knoweth not any soul in what lands he
    shall die: Verily Allah is All-knowing, All- aware. (Qur\'an,
    31:34)]
