*This sermon is known as the Sermon of Skeletons*

*(Khutbatu\'l-Ashbah) and it holds one of the highest positions among
the sermons of Amir al-mu\'minin.*

Mas'adah ibn Sadaqah has related from al-Imam Ja'far ibn Muhammad
as-Sadiq (p.b.u.t.) saying: \"Amir al-mu\'minin delivered this sermon
from the pulpit of (the mosque of) Kufah when someone asked him, \'O
Amir al-mu\'minin! Describe Allah for us in such a way that we may
imagine that we see Him with eyes so that our love and knowledge may
increase about Him.\'

Amir al-mu\'minin became angry at this (request of the questioner) and
ordered the Muslims to gather in the mosque. So many Muslims gathered in
the mosque that the place was over-crowded. Then Amir al-mu\'minin
ascended the pulpit while he was still in a state of anger and his
colour was changed. After he had praised Allah and extolled Him and
sought His blessings on the Prophet he said:

> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام)

> تعرف بخطبة الاشباح وهي من جلائل الخُطب

> روى مسعدة بن صدقة عن الصادق جعفر بن محمّد (عليهما السلام) أنّه قال:

> خطب أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام والصلاة بهذه الخطبة على منبر الكوفة،
> وذلك أن رجلاً أتاه فقال له: يا أميرالمؤمنين! صف لنا ربّنا مثلما نراه
> عيانا لنزداد له حباً وبه معرفة. فغضب (عليه السلام) ونادى: الصلاة جامعة،
> فاجتمع الناس حتى غصّ المسجد بأهله . فصعد المنبر وهو مغضب متغيّر اللون،
> فحمد الله سبحانه وصلّى على النبي (صلى الله عليه وآله)، ثمّ قال:

## Description of Allah

> وصف الله تعالى

Praise be to Allah Who is not enriched by the refusal to give away and
stinginess, and Who is not impoverished by munificence and generosity,
although everyone who gives away loses (to that extent) except He, and
everyone who withholds is blamed for his niggardliness but He. He
obliges through beneficial bounties and plentiful gifts and grants. The
whole creation is His dependants (in
sustenance).{#epub.html_fref_273b8122_2
.see-footnote}

He has guaranteed their livelihood and ordained their sustenance. He has
prepared the way for those who turn to Him and those who seek what is
with Him. He is as generous about what He is asked as He is about that
for which He is not asked. He is the First for whom there was no
\'before\' so that there could be anything before Him.

He is the Last for whom there is no \'after\' so that there could be
anything after Him. He prevents the pupils of the eyes from seeing Him
or perceiving Him. Time does not change over Him, so as to admit of any
change of condition about Him. He is not in any place so as to allow Him
movement (from one place to another).

> الْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي لاَ يَفِرُهُ الْمَنْعُ وَالْجُمُودُ، وَلاَ يُكْدِيهِ الاْعْطَاءُ وَالْجُودُ; إِذْ كُلُّ
> مُعْط مُنْتَقِصٌ سِوَاهُ، وَكُلُّ مَانِع مَذْمُومٌ مَا خَلاَهُ، وَهُوَ الْمَنَّانُ بِفَوَائِدِ النِّعَمِ،
> وَعَوائِدِ المَزِيدِ وَالْقِسَمِ، عِيَالُهُ الْخَلاَئِقُ، ضَمِنَ أَرْزَاقَهُمْ، وَقَدَّرَ أَقْوَاتَهُمْ، وَنَهَجَ
> سَبِيلَ الرَّاغِبِينَ إِلَيْهِ، وَالطَّالِبِينَ مَا لَدَيْهِ، وَلَيْسَ بِمَا سُئِلَ بِأَجْوَدَ مِنْهُ بِمَا لَمْ
> يُسْأَلُ. الاَوَّلُ الَّذِي لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ قَبْلٌ فَيَكُونَ شَيءٌ قَبْلَهُ، وَالاخِرُ الَّذِي لَيْسَ لَهُ بَعْدٌ
> فَيَكُونَ شَيْءٌ بَعْدَهُ، وَالرَّادِعُ أَنَاسِيَّ الاْبْصَارِ عَنْ أَنْ تَنَالَهُ أَوْ تُدْرِكَهُ، مَا اخْتَلَفَ
> عَلَيْهِ دَهْرٌ فَيَخْتَلِفَ مِنْهُ الحَالُ، وَلاَ كَانَ فِي مَكَان فَيَجُوزَ عَلَيْهِ الانتِقَالُ،

If He gives away all that the mines of the mountains emit out or the
gold, silver, pearls and cuttings of coral which the shells of the ocean
vomit out, it would not affect his munificence, nor diminish the extent
of what He has. (In fact) He would still have such treasures of bounty
as would not decrease by the demands of the creatures, because He is
that generous Being Whom the begging of beggars cannot make poor nor the
pertinacity of beseechers make miser.

> وَلَوْ وَهَبَ مَاتَنَفَّسَتْ عَنْهُ مَعَادِنُ الْجِبَالِ، وَضَحِكَتْ عِنْهُ أَصْدَافُ الْبِحَارِ، مِنْ فِلِزِّ
> اللُّجَيْنِ وَالْعِقْيَانِ، وَنُثَارَةِ الدُّرِّ وَحَصِيدِ الْمَرْجَانِ، مَا أَثَّرَ ذلِكَ فِي جُودِهِ، وَلاَ
> أَنْفَدَ سَعَةَ مَا عِنْدَهُ، وَلَكَانَ عِنْدَهُ مِنْ ذَخَائِرِ الاَنْعَامِ مَا لاَ تُنْفِدُهُ مَطَالِبُ
> الاَنَامِ، لاِنَّهُ الْجَوَادُ الَّذِي لاَ يَغِيضُهُ سُؤَالُ السَّائِلِينَ، وَلاَ يُبْخِلُهُ إِلْحَاحُ

## Attributes of Allah as described in the Holy Qur\'an

> صفاته تعالى في القرآن

Then look on, questioner; be confined to those of His attributes which
the Qur\'an had described and seek light from the effulgence of its
guidance. Leave to Allah that knowledge which Satan has prompted you to
seek and which neither the Qur\'an enjoins you to seek nor is there any
trace of it in the actions or sayings of the Prophet and other leaders
*(A'immah)* of guidance. This is the extreme limit of Allah\'s claim
upon you.

Know that firm in knowledge are those who refrain from opening the
curtains that lie against the unknown, and their acknowledgement of
ignorance about the details of the hidden unknown prevents them from
further probe. Allah praises them for their admission that they are
unable to get knowledge not allowed to them. They do not go deep into
the discussion of what is not enjoined upon them about knowing Him and
they call it firmness. Be content with this and do not limit the
Greatness of Allah after the measure of your own intelligence, or else
you will be among the destroyed ones.

> فَانْظُرْ أَيُّهَا السَّائِلُ: فَمَا دَلَّكَ الْقُرْآنُ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ صِفَتِهِ فَائْتَمَّ بِهِ وَاسْتَضِىءْ بِنُورِ
> هِدَايَتِهِ، وَمَا كَلَّفَكَ الشَّيْطَانُ عِلْمَهُ مِمَّا لَيْسَ فِي الْكِتَابِ عَلَيْكَ فَرْضُهُ، وَلاَ فِي سُنَّةِ
> النَّبِيِّ(صلى الله عليه وآله) وَأَئِمَّةِ الْهُدَى أَثَرُهُ، فَكِلْ عِلْمَهُ إِلَى اللهِ سُبْحَانَهُ،
> فَإِنَّ ذلِكَ مُنْتَهَى حَقِّ اللهِ عَلَيْكَ. وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الرَّاسِخِينَ فِي الْعِلْمِ هُمُ الَّذِينَ أَغْنَاهُمْ
> عَنِ اقْتِحَامِ السُّدَدِ الْمَضْرُوبَةِ دُونَ الْغُيُوبِ، الاِْقْرَارُ بِجُمْلَةِ مَا جَهِلُوا تَفْسِيرَهُ مِنَ
> الْغيْبِ الْـمَحْجُوبِ، فَمَدَحَ اللهُ ـ تَعَالَى ـ اعْتِرَافَهُمْ بِالْعَجْزِ عَنْ تَنَاوُلِ مَا لَمْ
> يُحِيطُوا بِهِ عِلْماً، وَسَمَّى تَرْكَهُمُ التَّعَمُّقَ فِيَما لَمْ يُكَلِّفْهُمُ الْبَحْثَ عَنْ كُنْهِهِ رُسُوخاً،
> فاقْتَصِرْ عَلَى ذَلِكَ، وَلاَتُقَدِّرْ عَظَمَةَ اللهِ سُبْحَانَهُ عَلَى قَدْرِ عَقْلِكَ فَتَكُونَ مِنَ
> الْهَالِكِينَ.

He is Powerful, such that when imagination shoots its arrows to
comprehend the extremity of His power, and mind, making itself free of
the dangers of evil thoughts, tries to find Him in the depth of His
realm, and hearts long to grasp realities of His attributes and openings
of intelligence penetrate beyond description in order to secure
knowledge about His Being, crossing the dark pitfalls of the unknown and
concentrating towards Him He would turn them back. They would return
defeated admitting that the reality of His knowledge cannot be
comprehended by such random efforts, nor can an iota of the sublimity of
His Honour enter the understanding of thinkers.

> هُوَ الْقَادِرُ الَّذِي إِذَا ارْتَمَتِ الاَوْهَامُ لِتُدْرِكَ مُنْقَطَعَ قُدْرَتِهِ، وَحَاوَلَ الْفِكْرُ الْمُبَرَّأُ
> مِنْ خَطَرَاتِ الْوَسَاوِسِ أَنْ يَقَعَ عَلَيْهِ فِي عَمِيقَاتِ غُيُوبِ مَلَكُوتِهِ، وَتَوَلَّهَتِ الْقُلُوبُ إِلَيْهِ
> لِتَجْرِيَ فِي كَيْفِيَّةِ صِفَاتِهِ، وَغَمَضَتْ مَدَاخِلُ الْعُقُولِ في حَيْثُ لاَ تَبْلُغُهُ الصِّفَاتُ لِتنالَ
> عِلْمَ ذَاتِهِ، رَدَعَهَا وَهِيَ تَجُوبُ مَهَاوِيَ سُدَفِ الْغُيُوبِ، مُتَخَلِّصَةً إِلَيْهِ ـ سُبْحَانَهُ ـ
> فَرَجَعَتْ إِذْ جُبِهَتْ، مُعتَرِفَةً بِأَنَّهُ لاَ يُنَالُ بِجَوْرِ الاعْتِسَافِ كُنْهُ مَعْرِفَتِهِ، وَلاَ تَخْطُرُ
> بِبَالِ أُولِي الرَّوِيَّاتِ خَاطِرَةٌ مِنْ تَقْدِيرِ جَلاَلِ عِزَّتِهِ.

## About Allah\'s creation

He originated the creation without any example which He could follow and
without any specimen prepared by any known creator that was before Him.
He showed us the realm of His Might, and such wonders which speak of His
Wisdom. The confession of the created things that their existence owes
itself to Him made us realise that argument has been furnished about
knowing Him (so that there is no excuse against it). The signs of His
creative power and standard of His wisdom are fixed in the wonderful
things He has created. Whatever He has created is an argument in His
favour and a guide towards Him. Even a silent thing is a guide towards
Him as though it speaks, and its guidance towards the Creator is clear.

> الَّذِي ابْتَدَعَ الْخَلْقَ عَلَى غَيْرِ مِثَال امْتَثَلَهُ، وَلاَ مِقْدَار احْتَذَى عَلَيْهِ، مِنْ خَالِق
> مَعْبُود كَانَ قَبْلَهُ، وَأَرَانَا مِنْ مَلَكُوتِ قُدْرَتِهِ، وَعَجَائِبِ مَا نَطَقَتْ بِهِ آثارُ حِكْمَتِهِ،
> وَاعْتِرَافِ الْحَاجَةِ مِنَ الْخَلْقِ إِلَى أَنْ يُقِيمَهَا بِمِسَاكِ قُوَّتِهِ، مَا دَلَّنا بِاضْطِرَارِ قِيَامِ
> الْحُجَّةِ لَهُ عَلَى مَعْرِفَتِهِ، وَظَهَرَتِ الْبَدَائِعُ الَّتِي أحْدَثَها آثَارُ صَنْعَتِهِ، وَأَعْلاَمُ
> حِكْمَتِهِ، فَصَارَ كُلُّ مَا خَلَقَ حُجَّةً لَهُ وَدَلِيلاً عَلَيْهِ، وَإِنْ كَانَ خَلْقاً صَامِتاً، فَحُجَّتُهُ
> بِالتَّدْبير نَاطِقَةٌ، وَدَلاَلَتُهُ عَلَى الْمُبْدِعِ قَائِمَةٌ.

(O Allah) I stand witness that he who likens Thee with the separateness
of the limbs or with the joining of the extremities of his body did not
acquaint his inner self with knowledge about Thee, and his heart did not
secure conviction to the effect that there is no partner for Thee. It is
as though he has not heard the (wrongful) followers disclaiming their
false gods by sayings

***\"By Allah, we were certainly in manifest error when we equalled you
with the Lord of the worlds.\"*** **(Qur\'an, 26:97-98).**

They are wrong who liken Thee to their idols, and dress Thee with
apparel of the creatures by their imagination, attribute to Thee parts
of body by their own thinking and consider Thee after the creatures of
various types, through the working of their intelligence. I stand
witness that whoever equated Thee with anything out of Thy creation took
a match for Thee, and whoever takes a match for Thee is an unbeliever,
according to what is stated in Thy unambiguous verses and indicated by
the evidence of Thy clear arguments. (I also stand witness that) Thou
art that Allah who cannot be confined in (the fetters of) intelligence
so as to admit change of condition by entering its imagination nor in
the shackles of mind so as to become limited and an object of
alterations.

> لِتَدْبِيرِ حِكْمَتِكَ، لَمْ يَعْقِدْ غَيْبَ ضَمِيرِهِ عَلَى مَعْرِفَتِكَ، وَلَمْ يُبَاشِرْ قَلْبَهُ الْيَقِينُ بِأَنَّهُ

## A part of the same sermon about the greatest perfection in Allah\'s creation

He has fixed limits for every thing He has created and made the limits
firm, and He has fixed its working and made the working delicate. He has
fixed its direction and it does not transgress the limits of its
position nor fall short of reaching the end of its aim. It did not
disobey when it was commanded to move at His will; and how could it do
so when all matters are governed by His will. He is the Producer of
varieties of things without exercise of imagination, without the urge of
an impulse, hidden in Him, without (the benefit of) any experiment taken
from the vicissitudes of time and without any partner who might have
assisted Him in creating wonderful things.

> قَدَّرَ مَا خَلَقَ فَأَحْكَمَ تَقْدِيرَهُ، وَدَبَّرَهُ فَأَلْطَفَ تَدْبِيرَهُ، وَوَجَّهَهُ لِوِجْهَتِهِ فَلَمْ يَتَعَدَّ
> حُدُودَ مَنْزِلَتِهِ، وَلَمْ يَقْصُرْ دُونَ الاْنْتِهَاءِ إِلى غَايَتِهِ، وَلَمْ يَسْتَصْعِبْ إِذْ أُمِرَ بِالْمُضِيِّ
> عَلَى إِرَادَتِهِ، وَكَيْفَ وَإِنَّمَا صَدَرَتِ الاْمُورُ عَنْ مَشيئَتِهِ؟ الْمُنْشِىءُ أصْنَافَ الاْشْيَاءِ
> بِلاَ رَوِيَّةِ فِكْر آلَ إِلَيْهَا، وَلاَ قَريحَةِ غَرِيزَة ضْمَرَ عَلَيْهَا، وَلاَ تَجْرِبَة أَفَادَهَا مِنْ
> حَوَادِثِ الدُّهُورِ، وَلاَ شَرِيك أَعَانَهُ عَلَى ابْتِدَاعِ عَجَائِبِ الاْمورِ،

Thus the creation was completed by His order and it bowed to His
obedience and responded to His call. The laziness of any slug or the
inertness of any excuse-finder did not prevent it from doing so. So He
straightened the curves of the things and fixed their limits. With His
power He created coherence in their contradictory parts and joined
together the factors of similarity. Then He separated them in varieties
which differ in limits, quantities, properties and shapes. All this is
new creation. He made them firm and shaped them according as He wished
and invented them.

> فَتَمَّ خَلْقُهُ، وَأَذْعَنَ لِطَاعَتِهِ، وَأَجَابَ إِلى دَعْوَتِهِ، لَم يَعْتَرِضْ دُونَهُ رَيْثُ الْمُبْطِىءِ،
> وَلاَ أَنَاةُ الْمُتَلَكِّىءِ، فَأَقَامَ مِنَ الاْشْيَاءِ أَوَدَهَا، وَنَهَجَ حُدُودَهَا، وَلاَءَمَ بِقُدْرَتِهِ
> بَيْنَ مُتَضَادِّهَا، وَوَصَلَ أَسْبَابَ قَرَائِنِهَا، وَفَرَّقَهَا أَجْنَاساً مُخْتَلِفَات فِي الْحُدُودِ
> وَالاْقْدَارِ، وَالْغرَائِزِ وَالْهَيْئَاتِ، بَدَايَا خَلاَئِقَ أَحْكَمَ صُنْعَهَا، وَفَطَرَهَا عَلَى مَا
> أَرَادَ وَابْتَدَعَهَا!

## A part of the same sermon, containing description of the sky

> منها: في صفة السماء

He has arranged the depressions and elevations of the openings of the
sky. He has joined the breadths of its breaches, and has joined them
with one another. He has made easy the approach to its heights for those
(angels) who come down with His commands and those (angels) who go up
with the deeds of the creatures. He called it when it was yet (in the
form of) vapour. At once the links of its joints joined up. Then Allah
opened up its closed door and put the sentinels of meteors at its holes,
and held them with His hands (i.e. power) from falling into the vastness
of air.

> وَنَظَمَ بِلاَ تَعْلِيق رَهَوَاتِ فُرَجِهَا، وَلاَحَمَ صُدُوعَ انْفِرَاجِهَا، وَوَشَّجَ بَيْنَهَا وَبَيْنَ
> أَزْوَاجِهَا، وَذَلَّلَ لِلْهَابِطِينَ بِأَمْرِهِ، وَالْصَّاعِدِينَ بِأَعْمَالِ خَلْقِهِ، حُزُونَةَ مِعْرَاجِهَا،
> وَنَادَاهَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هِيَ دُخَانٌ مُبِينٌ، فَالْتَحَمَتْ عُرَى أَشْرَاجِهَا، وَفَتَقَ بَعْدَ الارْتِتَاقِ
> صَوَامِتَ أَبْوَابِهَا، وَأَقَامَ رَصَداً مِنَ الشُّهُبِ الثَّوَاقِبِ عَلَى نِقَابِهَا، وَأَمْسَكَهَا مِنْ أَنْ
> تَمُورَ فِي خَرْقِ الْهَوَاءِ بِأَيْدِهِ

He commanded it to remain stationary in obedience to His commands. He
made its sun the bright indication for its day, and moon the gloomy
indication for its night. He then put them in motion in their orbits and
ordained their (pace of) movement in the stages of their paths in order
to distinguish with their help between night and day, and in order that
the reckoning of years and calculations may be known by their fixed
movements.

Then He hung in its vastness its sky and put therein its decoration
consisting of small bright pearls and lamp-like stars. He shot at the
over-hearers arrows of bright meteors. He put them in motion on their
appointed routine and made them into fixed stars, moving stars,
descending stars, ascending stars, ominous stars and lucky stars.

> وَأَمَرَهَا أَنْ تَقِفَ مُسْتَسْلِمَةً لاِمْرِهِ، وَجَعَلَ شَمْسَهَا آيَةً مُبْصِرَةً لِنَهَارِهَا، وَقَمَرَهَا آيَةً
> مَمْحُوَّةً مِنْ لَيْلِهَا، وَأَجْرَاهُمَا فِي مَنَاقِلِ مَجْرَاهُمَا، وَقَدَّرَ مَسِيَرهُما فِي مَدَارِجِ
> دَرَجِهِمَا، لُيمَيِّزَ بَيْنَ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ بِهِمَا، وَلِيُعْلَمَ عَدَدُ السِّنِينَ والْحِسَابُ
> بِمَقَادِيرِهِمَا، ثُمَّ عَلَّقَ فِي جَوِّهَا فَلَكَهَا، وَنَاطَ بِهَا زِينَتَهَا، مِنْ خَفِيَّاتِ دَرَارِيِّهَا،
> وَمَصَابِيحِ كَوَاكِبِهَا، وَرَمَى مُسْتَرِقِي السَّمْعِ بِثَوَاقِبِ شُهُبِهَا، وَأَجْرَاها عَلَى أَذْلاَلِ

> وَسُعُودِهَا.

## A part of the same sermon, containing description of Angels

> ومنها: في صفة الملائكة (عليهم السلام)

Then Allah, the Glorified, created for inhabiting of His skies and
populating the higher strata of his realm new (variety of) creatures
namely the angels. With them He filled the openings of its cavities and
populated with them the vastness of it circumference. In between the
openings of these cavities there resounds the voices of angels
glorifying Him in the enclosures of sublimity, (behind) curtains of
concealment and in veils of His Greatness. And behind this resounding
which deafens the ears there is the effulgence of light which defies the
approach of sight to it, and consequently the sight stands, disappointed
at its limitation.

> ثُمَّ خَلَقَ سُبْحَانَهُ لاِسْكَانِ سَمَاوَاتِهِ، وَعِمَارَةِ الصَّفِيحِ الاْعْلَى مِنْ مَلَكُوتِهِ، خَلْقاً
> بَدِيعاً مِنْ مَلاَئِكَتِهِ، وَمَلاَ بهِمْ فُرُوجَ فِجَاجِهَا، وَحَشَا بِهِمْ فُتُوقَ أَجْوَائِهَا، وَبَيْنَ
> فَجَوَاتِ تِلْكَ الْفُرُوجِ زَجَلُ الْمُسَبِّحِينَ مِنْهُمْ فِي حَظَائِرِ الْقُدُسِ، وَسُتُرَاتِ الْحُجُبِ،
> وَسُرَادِقَاتِ الْـمَجْدِ، وَوَرَاءَ ذلِكَ الرَّجِيج الَّذِي تَسْتَكُّ مِنْهُ الاْسْمَاعُ سُبُحَاتُ نُور تَرْدَعُ
> الاْبْصَارَ عَنْ بُلُوغِهَا، فَتَقِفُ خَاسِئَةً عَلَى حُدُودِهَا.

He created them in different shapes and with diverse characteristics.
They have wings. They glorify the sublimity of His Honour. They do not
appropriate to themselves His skill that shows itself in creation. Nor
do they claim they create anything in which He is unparalleled.

***\"But they are rather honoured creatures who do not take precedence
over Him in uttering anything, and they act according to His
command.\"*** **(Qur\'an, 21: 26-27).**

He has made them the trustees of His revelation and sent them to
Prophets as holders of His injunctions and prohibitions. He has
immunised them against the waviness of doubts. Consequently no one among
them goes astray from the path of His will. He has helped them with the
benefits of succour and has covered their hearts with humility and
peace. He has opened for them doors of submission to His Glories. He has
fixed for them bright minarets as signs of His Oneness.

The weights of sins do not burden them and the rotation of nights and
days does not make them move. Doubts do not attack with arrows the
firmness of their faith. Misgivings do not assault the bases of their
beliefs. The spark of malice does not ignite among them. Amazement does
not tarnish what knowledge of Him their hearts possess, or His greatness
and awe of His glory that resides in their bosoms. Evil thoughts do not

Among them are those who are in the frame of heavy clouds, or in the
height of lofty mountains, or in the gloom of over-powering darkness.
And there are those whose feet have pierced the lowest boundaries of the
earth. These feet are like white ensigns which have gone forth into the
vast expanse of wind. Under them blows the light wind which retains them
upto its last end.

> الْمُتَنَاهِيَةِ،

Occupation in His worship has made them carefree, and realities of Faith
have served as a link between them and His knowledge. Their belief in
Him has made them concentrate on Him. They long from Him not from
others. They have tasted the sweetness of His knowledge and have drunk
from the satiating cup of His love. The roots of His fear have been
implanted in the depth of their hearts. Consequently they have bent
their straight backs through His worship. The length of the humility and
extreme nearness has not removed from them the rope of their fear.

They do not entertain pride so as to make much of their acts. Their
humility before the glory of Allah does not allow them to esteem their
own virtues. Languor does not affect them despite their long affliction.
Their longings (for Him) do not lessen so that they might turn away from
hope in (Allah) their Sustainer. The tips of their tongues do not get
dry by constant prayers (to Allah). Engagements (in other matters) do
not betake them so as to turn their (loud) voices for Him into faint
ones. Their shoulders do not get displaced in the postures of worship.
They do not move their necks (this and that way) for comfort in
disobedience of His command. Follies of negligence do not act against
their determination to strive, and the deceptions of desires do not
overcome their courage.

> لَمْ يَتَوَلَّهُمُ الاْعْجَابُ فَيَسْتَكْثِرُوا مَا سَلَفَ مِنْهُمْ، وَلاَ تَرَكَتْ لَهُمُ اسْتِكَانَةُ الاْجْلاَلِ

They regard the Master of the Throne (Allah) as the store for the day of
their need. Because of their love (for Him) they turn to Him even when
others turn to the creatures. They do not reach the ending limit of His
worship. Their passionate fondness for His worship does not turn them
except to the springs of their own hearts, springs which are never
devoid of His hope and His fear. Fear (of Allah) never leaves them so
that they might slacken in their efforts, nor have temptations entrapped
them so that they might prefer this light search over their (serious)
effort.

> قَدْ اتَّخَذُوا ذَا الْعَرْشِ ذَخِيرَةً لِيَومِ فَاقَتِهمْ، وَيَمَّمُوهُ عِنْدَ انْقِطَاعِ الْخَلْقِ إِلى

> بِلُزُومِ طَاعَتِهِ، إِلاَّ إِلَى مَوَادَّ مِنْ قُلُوبِهمْ غَيْرِ مُنْقَطِعَة مِنْ رَجَائِهِ وَمَخَافَتِهِ، لَمْ
> تَنْقَطِعْ أَسْبَابُ الشَّفَقَةِ مِنْهُمْ، فَيَنُوا في جِدِّهِمْ، وَلَمْ تَأْسِرْهُمُ الاْطْمَاعُ فَيُؤْثِرُوا
> وَشِيكَ السَّعْىِ عَلَى اجْتِهَادِهِمْ.

They do not consider their past (virtuous) deeds to be great, for if
they had considered them great then (excessive) hope would have wiped
away fearfulness from their hearts. They did not differ (among
themselves) about their Sustainer as a result of Satan\'s control over
them. The vice of separation from one another did not disperse them.
Rancour and mutual malice did not overpower them. Ways of wavering did
not divide them. Differences of degree of courage did not render them
into divisions.

Thus they are captives of faith; neither crookedness (of mind), nor
excess, nor lethargy nor languor loosens them from its bond. There is
not the thinnest point in the skies but there is an angel over it in
prostration (before Allah) or (busy) in quick performance (of His
commands). By long worship of their Sustainer they increase their
knowledge, and the honour of their Sustainer increases in their hearts.

## A part of the same sermon, in description of earth and its spreading on water

> ومنها: في صفة الارض ودحوها على الماء

Allah spread the earth on stormy and tumultuous waves and the depths of
swollen seas, where waves clashed with each other and high surges leapt
over one another. They emitted foam like the he-camel at the time of
sexual excitement. So the tumult of the stormy water was subdued by the
weight of the earth, when the earth pressed it with its chest its
shooting agitation eased, and when the earth rolled on it with its
shoulder bones the water meekly submitted.

Thus after the tumult of its surges it became tame and overpowered, and
an obedient prisoner of the shackles of disgrace, while the earth spread
itself and became solid in the stormy depth of this water. (In this way)
the earth put an end to the pride, self conceit, high position and
superiority of the water, and muzzled the intrepidity of its flow.
Consequently it stopped after its stormy flow and settled down after its
tumult.

> كَبَسَ الاْرْضَ عَلى مَوْرِ أَمْوَاج مُسْتَفْحِلَة، وَلُجَجِ بِحَار زَاخِرَة، تَلْتَطِمُ أَوَاذِيُّ أمْواجِهَا،
> وَتَصْطَفِقُ مُتَقَاذِفَاتُ أَثْبَاجِها، وَتَرْغُو زَبَداً كَالْفُحُولِ عِنْدَ هِيَاجِهَا، فَخَضَعَ جِمَاحُ

> مُسْتَخْذِياً إِذْ تَمعَّكَتْ عَلَيْهِ بِكَوَاهِلِهَا، فَأَصْبَحَ بَعْدَ اصْطِخَابِ أَمْوَاجِهِ، سَاجِياً مَقْهُوراً،
> وَفِي حَكَمَةِ الذُّلِّ مُنْقَاداً أَسِيراً، وَسَكَنَتِ الاْرْضُ مَدْحُوَّةً فِي لُجَّةِ تَيَّارِهِ، وَرَدَّتْ مِنْ
> نَخْوَةِ بَأْوِهِ وَاعْتِلاَئِهِ، وَشُمُوخِ أَنْفِهِ وَسُمُوِّ غُلَوَائِهِ، وَكَعَمَتْهُ عَلَى كِظَّةِ جَرْيَتِهِ، فَهَمَدَ
> بَعْدَ نَزَقَاتِهِ، وبَعْدَ زَيَفَانِ وَثَبَاتِهِ.

When the excitement of water subsided under the earth\'s sides and under
the weight of the high and lofty mountains placed on its shoulders,
Allah flowed springs of water from its high tops and distributed them
through plains and low places and moderated their movement by fixed
rocks and high mountain tops. Then its trembling came to a standstill
because of the penetration of mountains in (various) parts of its
surface and their being fixed in its deep areas, and their standing on
its plains.

Then Allah created vastness between the earth and firmament, and
provided blowing wind for its inhabitants. Then He directed its
inhabitants to spread all over its convenient places. Thereafter He did
not leave alone the barren tracts of the earth where high portions
lacked in water-springs and where rivers could not find their way, but
created floating clouds which enliven the unproductive areas and grow
vegetation.

He made a big cloud by collecting together small clouds and when water
collected in it and lightning began to flash on its sides and the flash
continued under the white clouds as well as the heavy ones.He sent it
raining heavily. The cloud was hanging towards the earth and southerly
winds were squeezing it into shedding its water like a she-camel bending
down for milking.

When the cloud prostrated itself on the ground and delivered all the
water it carried on itself Allah grew vegetation on the plain earth and
herbage on dry mountains. As a result, the earth felt pleased at being
decorated with its gardens and wondered at her dress of soft vegetation
and the ornaments of its blossoms. Allah made all this the means of
sustenance for the people and feed for the beasts. He has opened up
highways in its expanse and has established minarets (of guidance) for
those who tread on its highways.

## On the Creation of Man and the sending of the Prophet

When He spread out the earth and enforced His commands He chose Adam
(peace be upon him) as the best in His creation and made him the first
of all creation. He made him to reside in Paradise and gave him ample
sustenance in it, and also instructed him regarding what He had
prohibited him. He told him that proceeding towards it meant His
disobedience and endangering his own position. But Adam did what he had
been refrained from, just as Allah already knew beforehand.
Consequently, Allah sent him down after (accepting) his repentance, to
populate His earth with his progeny and to serve as a proof and plea for
Him among his creatures.

> فَلَمَّا مَهَدَ أَرْضَهُ، وَأَنْفَذَ أَمْرَهُ، اخْتَارَ آدَمَ (عليه السلام)، خِيرَةً مِنْ خَلْقِهِ،
> وَجَعَلَهُ

> أَوّلَ جِبِلَّتِهِ، وَأَسْكَنَهُ جَنَّتَهُ، وَأَرْغَدَ فِيهَا أُكُلَهُ، وَأَوْعَزَ إِلَيْهِ فِيَما نَهَاهُ عَنْهُ،
> وَأَعْلَمَهُ أَنَّ فِي الاْقْدَامِ عَلَيْهِ التَّعرُّضَ لِمَعْصِيَتِهِ، وَالْـمُخَاطَرَةَ بِمَنْزِلَتِهِ; فَأَقْدَمَ
> عَلَى مَا نَهَاهُ عَنْهُ ـ مُوَافَاةً لِسَابِقِ عِلْمِهِ ـ فَأَهْبَطَهُ بَعْدَ التَّوْبَةِ لِيَعْمُرَ أَرْضَهُ
> بِنَسْلِهِ، وَلِيُقِيمَ الْحُجَّةَ بهِ عَلَى عِبَادِهِ،

Even when He made Adam die, He did not leave them without one who would
serve among them as proof and plea for His Godhead, and serve as the
link between them and His knowledge, but He provided to them the proofs
through His chosen Messengers and bearers of the trust of His Message,
age after age till the process came to end with our Prophet Muhammad -
Allah may bless him and his descendants - and His pleas and warnings
reached finality.

> ولَمْ يُخْلِهِمْ بَعْدَ أَنْ قَبَضَهُ، مِمَّا يُؤَكِّدُ عَلَيْهِمْ حُجَّةَ رُبُوبِيَّتِهَ، وَيَصِلُ بَيْنَهُمْ وَبَيْنَ

He ordained
livelihoods{#epub.html_fref_0b1248e4_3
.see-footnote} with plenty and with paucity. He distributed them
narrowly as well as profusely. He did it with justice to test whomever
He desired, with prosperity or with destitution, and to test through it
the gratefulness or endurance of the rich and the poor. Then He coupled
plenty with misfortunes of destitution, safety with the distresses of
calamities and pleasures of enjoyment with pangs of grief. He created
fixed ages and made them long or short and earlier or later, and ended
them up with death. He had made death capable of pulling up the ropes of
ages and cutting them asunder.

He
knows the secrets of those who conceal them, the secret conversation of
those who engage in it, the inner feelings of those who indulge in
guesses, the established certainties, the furtive glances of the eyes,
the inner contents of hearts and depths of the unknown. He also knows
what can be heard only by bending the holes of the ears, the summer
resorts of ants and winter abodes of the insects, resounding of the
cries of wailing women and the sound of steps.

He also knows the spots in the inner sheaths of leaves where fruits
grow, the hiding places of beasts namely caves in mountains and valleys,
the hiding holes of mosquitoes on the trunks of trees and their herbage,
the sprouting points of leaves in the branches, the dripping points of
semen passing through passages of loins, small rising clouds and the big
giant ones, the drops of rain in the thick clouds, the particles of dust
scattered by whirlwinds through their skirts, the lines erased by rain
floods, the movements of insects on sand-dunes, the nests of winged
creatures on the cliffs of mountains and the singing of chattering birds
in the gloom of their brooding places.

On all this He suffers no trouble, and no impediment hampers Him in the
preservation of what he created nor any languor or grief hinders Him
from the enforcement of commands and management of the creatures. His
knowledge penetrates through them and they are within His counting. His
justice extends to all of them and His bounty encompasses them despite
their falling short of what is due to Him.

O My God! Thou deservest handsome description and the highest esteem. If
wish is directed towards Thee, Thou art the best to be wished for. If
hope is reposed in Thee, Thou art the Most Honoured to be hoped from. O
My God! Thou hast bestowed on me such power that I do not praise any one
other than Thee, and I do not eulogise any one save Thee. I do not
direct my praise towards others who are sources of disappointment and
centres of misgivings. Thou hast kept away my tongue from the praises of
human beings and eulogies of the created and the sustained. O My God!
Every praiser has on whom he praises the right of reward and recompense.
Certainly, I have turned to Thee with my eye at the treasures of Thy
Mercy and stores of forgiveness.

O My God! Here stands one who has singled Thee with Oneness that is Thy
due and has not regarded any one deserving of these praises and eulogies

generosity can cure its destitution, nor provide for its need except Thy
obligation and Thy generosity. So do grant us in this place Thy will and
make us free from stretching hands to anyone other than Thee.

-  The name of this
    sermon is the Sermon of \"al-Ashbah\". \"ashbah\" is the plural of
    shabah which means skeleton, since it contains description of angels
    and other kinds of beings it has been named by this name.\
    The reason for being angry at the questioner was that his request
    was unconnected with the obligations of shari\`ah and beyond limits
    of human capacity.]
-  Allah is the
    Guarantor of sustenance and Provider of livelihood as He says:\
    No creature is there crawling on the earth, but its provision rests
    on Allah\...(Qur\'an, 11:6)\
    But His being guarantor means that He has provided ways for everyone
    to live and earn livelihood, and has allowed every one equal shares
    in forests, mountains, rivers, mines and in the vast earth, and has
    given everyone the right to make use of them. His bounties are not
    confined to any single person, nor is the door of His sustenance
    closed to any one. Thus, Allah says:\
    All We do aid, these and (also) those out of the bounty of thy Lord;
    and the bounty of thy Lord is not confined. (Qur\'an, 17:20)\
    If some one does not secure these things through languor or ease and
    sits effortless it is not possible that livelihood would reach his
    door. Allah has laid the table with multifarious feeds but to get
    them it is necessary to extend the hand. He has deposited pearls in
    the bottom of the sea but it requires diving to get them out. He has
    filled the mountains with rubies and precious stones but they cannot
    be had without digging the stones. The earth contains treasures of
    growth but benefit cannot be drawn from them without sowing of seed.
    Heaps of edibles lie scattered on all four sides of the earth but
    they cannot be collected without the trouble of travelling. Thus,
    Allah says:\
    \... Traverse ye then its broad sides, and eat ye of His provision .
    . .(Qur\'an, 67:15)\
    Allah\'s providing livelihood does not mean that no effort is needed
    in searching livelihood or no going out of the house is required for
    it, and that livelihood should itself finds its way to the seeker.
    The meaning of His being the provider of livelihood is that He has
    given earth the property of growing, He has sent rain from clouds
    for germination, created fruits, vegetables and grains. All this is
    from Allah but securing them is connected with human effort. Whoever
    will strive will reap the benefits of his efforts, and whoever
    abstains from strife would face the consequences of his idleness and
    laziness. Accordingly Allah says: And that man shall have nothing
    but what he striveth for. (Qur\'an, 53:39)\
    The order of universe hinges on the maxim \"Sow and reap.\" It is
    wrong to expect germination without sowing, to hope for results
    without effort. Limbs and faculties have been given solely to be
    kept active. Thus, Allah addresses Mary and says: And shake towards
    thee the trunk of the palm-tree, it will drop on thee dates fresh
    (and) ripe. Then eat and drink and refresh the eye\... (Qur\'an,
    19:25-26) Allah provided the means for Mary\'s livelihood. He did
    not however pluck the dates from the tree and put them in her lap.
    This was because so far as production of food goes it is His
    concern. So he made the tree green, put fruits on it and ripened the
    fruits. But when the stage arrived for plucking them He did not
    intervene. He just recalled to Mary her job namely that she should
    now move her hand and get her food.\
    Again, if His providing the livelihood means that whatever is given
    is given by Him and whatever is received from Him, then whatever a
    man would earn and eat, and in whatever manner he would obtain it
    would be permissible for him, whether he obtains it by theft,
    bribery, oppression or violence, because it would mean Allah\'s act
    and the food would be that given by Him, wherein he would have no
    free will, and where anything is out of the limits of free action
    there is no question of permissible or forbidden for it, nor is
    there any liability to account for it. But when it is not actually
    so and there is the question of permissible and forbidden then it
    should have bearing on human actions, so that it could be questioned
    whether is was secured in lawful or unlawful manner. Of course,
    where He has not bestowed the power of seeking the livelihood, there
    He has taken upon Himself the responsibility to provide the
    livelihood. Consequently, He has managed for the feeding of the
    embryo in the mother\'s womb, and it reaches him there according to
    its needs and requirements. But when this very young life enters the
    wide world and picks up energy to move its limbs, then it can\'t get
    its food from the source without moving his lips (for
    sucking).]
-  In the management
    of the affairs of this world Allah has connected the sequence with
    the cause of human acts as a result of which the power of action in
    man does not remain idle, in the same way He had made these actions
    dependent on His own will, so man should not rely on his own power
    of action and forget the Creator. This is the issue of the will
    between two wills in the controversy of \"free will or compulsion\".
    Just as in the entire Universe nature\'s universal and sovereign law
    is in force, in the same way the production and distribution of food
    also is provided in a set manner under the dual force of Divine
    ordainment and human effort. And this is somewhere less and
    somewhere more depending on the proportion of human effort and the
    aim of Divine ordainment. Since He is the Creator of the means of
    livelihood, and the powers of seeking food have also been bestowed
    by Him, the paucity or plenty of livelihood has been attributed to
    Him because He has fixed different and separate measures for
    livelihood keeping in view the difference in efforts and actions and
    the good of the creatures. Somewhere there is poverty and somewhere
    affluence, somewhere distress and somewhere comfort, and some one is
    enjoying pleasure while some one else is suffering the hardships of
    want.\
    Qur\'an says: \...amplifieth He their sustenance unto whomsoever He
    willeth and straiteneth; Verily He knoweth all things. (Qur\'an,
    42:12)\
    In sermon 23, Amir al-mu\'minin has referred to this matter and
    said: The Divine command descends from the sky towards the earth
    with whatever is ordained for every one, whether less or more, just
    like rain drops.\
    So just as there is a fixed process and manner for the benevolence
    of rain namely that vapours rise from the sea with the store of
    water, spread over in the sky in the shape of dark clouds and then
    ooze the water by drops till they form themselves in regular lines.
    They irrigate plains as well as high lands thoroughly and proceed
    onwards to collect in the low areas, so that the thirsty may drink
    it, animals may use it and dry lands may be watered from it. In the
    same way Allah has provided all the means of livelihood but His
    bounty follows a particular mode in which there is never a jot of
    deviation. Thus Allah says: And there is not a thing but with Us are
    its treasures, and We do not send it down but in a known measure.
    (Qur\'an, 15:21)\
    If man\'s greed and avarice exceeds its bounds, then just as excess
    of rain ruins crops instead of growing and bringing them up, so the
    abundance of the article of livelihood and necessaries of life would
    make man oblivious of Allah and rouse him to revolt and unruliness.
    Consequently, Allah says: And should Allah amplify the sustenance
    unto his servants, they would certainly rebel in the earth, but He
    sendeth it down by measure as he willeth; Verily of His servants, He
    is All-aware, All-seeing. (Qur\'an, 42:27)\
    If He lessens the food then just as stoppage of rain makes the land
    arid and kills the animals, in the same way, by closure of the means
    of livelihood, human society would be destroyed and so there would
    remain no means of living and livelihood. Allah accordingly says: Or
    who is that who can provide you with sustenance should He withhold
    His sustenance?\...(Qur\'an, 67:21)\
    Consequently, Allah, the Wise, the Omniscient, has put the
    organisation for livelihood on moderate and proportionate lines, and
    in order to emphasise the importance of livelihood and sustenance
    and to keep them correlated with each other has introduced
    differences in the distribution of livelihood. Sometimes, this
    difference and unequal distribution owes itself to the difference of
    human effort and sometimes it is the consequence of overall
    arrangement of the affairs of the Universe and Divine acts of wisdom
    and objectives. This is because, if by poverty and want He has
    tested the poor in endurance and patience, in affluence and wealth
    there is severe test of the rich by way of thanks-giving and
    gratifying the rights of others, namely whether the rich person
    gratifies the claims of the poor and the distressed, and whether he
    takes care of the destitute or not. Again, where there is wealth
    there would also be dangers of all sorts. Sometimes there would be
    danger to the wealth and property and sometimes fear of poverty and
    want.\
    Consequently, there would be many persons who would be more
    satisfied and happy for lack of wealth. For them this destitution
    and want would be far better than the wealth which might snatch away
    their comfort and peace. Moreover sometimes this very wealth which
    one holds dearer than life becomes the cause of loss of one\'s life.
    Further, it has also been seen that so long as wealth was lacking
    character was above reproach, life was unblemished, but the moment
    property and wealth changed into plenty the conduct worsened,
    character became faulty and there appeared the vice of drink, crowd
    of beauties and gathering of singing and music. In such a case the
    absence of wealth was a blessing. However, being ignorant of
    Allah\'s objectives, man cries out and being affected by transitory
    distress begins complaining but does not realise from how many vices
    which could have accrued owing to wealth he has remained aloof.
    Therefore, if wealth produces conveniences, poverty serves as a
    guard for the character.]
-  The eloquence
    with which Amir al-mu\'minin has thrown light on Allah\'s attributes
    of knowledge and the sublime words in which he has pictured the
    all-engrossing quality of His knowledge cannot but impress the mind
    of the most die-hard opponent. Thus, Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid has written:\
    If Aristotle, who believed that Allah is only aware of the universe
    and not of its particulars, had heard this speech, his heart too
    would have inclined, his hair would have stood on end and his
    thinking would have undergone a dramatic change. Do you not see the
    brightness, force, vehemence, sublimity, glory, seriousness and
    ripeness of this speech? Besides these qualities, there is
    sweetness, colourfulness, delicacy and smoothness in it. I have not
    found any utterance similar to it. Of course, if there is any
    utterance matching it, that can be the word of Allah only. And there
    is no wonder in it, because he is an off-shoot of the same tree (of
    the Prophet Ibrahim, who set up the Unity of Allah), a distributory
    of the same river and a reflection of the same light. (Sharh Nahjul
    Balaghah, vol.7, pp. 23-24)\
    Those who regard Allah to possess only over-all knowledge argue that
    since details undergo changes, to believe Him to have knowledge of
    the changing details would necessitate changes in His knowledge but
    since knowledge is the same as His Being, His Being would have to be
    regarded as the object of change the result of which would be that
    He would have to be taken as having come into existence. In this way
    He would lose the attribute of being from ever. This is a very
    deceptive fallacy because changes in the object of knowledge can
    lead to changes in the knower only when it is assumed that the
    knower does not already possess knowledge of these changes. But
    since all the forms of change and alteration are crystal clear
    before Him there is no reason that with the changes in the objects
    of knowledge He too should be regarded changeable, although really
    this change is confined to the object of knowledge and does not
    affect knowledge in itself.]
