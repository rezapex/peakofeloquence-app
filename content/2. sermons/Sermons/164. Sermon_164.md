When people went to Amir al-mu\'minin in a deputation and complained to
him through what they had to say against 'Uthman, and requested him to
speak to him on their behalf and to admonish him for their sake, he went
to see him and said:

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> لما اجتمع الناس اليه وشكوا ما نقموه على عثمان وسألوه مخاطبته واستعتابه
> لهم، فدخل(عليه السلام) على عثمان فقال:

The people are behind me and they have made me an ambassador between you
and themselves; but by Allah, I do not know what to say to you. I know
nothing (in this matter) which you do not know, nor can I lead you to
any matter of which you are not aware. You certainly know what we know,
we have not come to know anything before you which we could tell you;
nor did we learn anything in secret which we should convey to you. You
have seen as we have seen and you have heard as we have heard. You sat
in the company of the Prophet of Allah as we did. (Abu Bakr) Ibn Abi
Quhafah and ('Umar) ibn al-Khattab were no more responsible for acting
righteously than you, since you are nearer than both of them to the
Prophet of Allah through kinship, and you also hold relationship to him
by marriage which they do not hold.

> إِنَّ النَّاسَ وَرَائي، وَقَدِ اسْتَسْفَرُوني بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَهُمْ، وَوَاللهِ مَا أَدْرِي مَا أَقُولُ لَكَ!
> مَا أَعْرِفُ شَيْئاً تَجْهَلُهُ، وَلاَ أَدُلُّكَ عَلَى أَمْر لاَ تَعْرِفُهُ، إِنَّكَ لَتَعْلَمُ مَا نَعْلَمُ، مَا
> سَبَقْنَاكَ إِلَى شَيْء فَنُخْبِرَكَ عَنْهُ، وَلاَ خَلَوْنَا بِشَيْء فَنُبَلِّغَكَهُ، وَقَدْ رَأَيْتَ كَمَا رَأَيْنَا،
> وَسَمِعْتَ كَمَا سَمِعْنَا، وَصَحِبْتَ رَسُولَ الله(صلى الله عليه وآله) كَمَا صَحِبْنَا. وَمَا
> ابْنُ أَبِي قُحَافَةَ وَلاَ ابْنُ الْخَطَّابِ بِأَوْلَى بِعَمَلِ الْحَقِّ مِنْكَ، وَأَنْتَ أَقْرَبُ إِلَى رَسُولِ
> اللهِ(صلى الله عليه وآله) وَشِيجَةَ رَحِم مِنْهُمَا، وَقَدْ نِلْتَ مَنْ صَهْرِهِ مَا لَمْ يَنَالاَ.

Then (fear) Allah, in your own self; for, by Allah, you are not being
shown anything as if you are blind or being apprised of anything as if
you are ignorant. The ways are clear while the banners of faith are
fixed. You should know that among the creatures of Allah, the most
distinguished person before Allah is the just Imam who has been guided
(by Allah) and guides others. So, he stands by the recognised ways of
the Prophet\'s behaviour and destroys unrecognised innovations.

The (Prophet\'s) ways are clear and they have signs, while innovations
are also clear and they too have signs. Certainly, the worst man before
Allah is the oppressive Imam who has gone astray and through whom others
go astray. He destroys the the accepted *sunnah* and revives abandoned
innovations. I heard the Messenger of Allah saying: \"On the Day of
Judgement the oppressive Imam will be brought without anyone to support
him or anyone to advance excuses on his behalf, and then he will be
thrown into Hell where he will rotate as the hand-mill rotates, then
(eventually) he will be confined to its hollow.\"

> فَاللهَ اللهَ فِي نَفْسِكَ! فَإِنَّكَ ـ وَاللهِ ـ مَا تُبَصَّرُ مِنْ عَمىً، وَلاَ تُعَلّمُ مِنْ جَهْل،
> وَإِنَّ الْطُّرُقَ لَوَاضِحَةٌ، وَإِنَّ أَعْلاَمَ الدِّينِ لَقَائِمَةٌ. فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ أَفْضَلَ عِبَادِاللهِ عِنْدَ
> اللهِ إِمَامٌ عَادِلٌ، هُدِيَ وَهَدَي، فَأَقَامَ سُنَّةً مَعْلُومَةً، وَأَمَاتَ بِدْعَةً مَجْهُولَةً، وَإِنَّ
> السُّنَنَ لَنَيِّرَةٌ، لَهَا أَعْلاَمٌ، وَإِنَّ الْبِدَعَ لَظَاهِرَةٌ، لَهَا أَعْلاَمٌ، وَإِنَّ شَرَّ النَّاسِ
> عِنْدَاللهِ إِمَامٌ جَائِرٌ ضَلَّ وَضُلَّ بِهِ، فَأَمَاتَ سُنَّةً مَأْخُوذَةً، وَأَحْيَا بِدْعَةً مَتْرُوكَةً. وَإِني
> سَمِعْتُ رَسُولَ اللهِ(صلى الله عليه وآله) يَقُولُ: \"يُؤْتَى يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ بِالاْمَامِ
> الْجَائِرِ وَلَيْسَ مَعَهُ نَصِيرٌ وَلاَ عَاذِرٌ، فَيُلْقَى فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ، فَيَدُورُ فِيهَا كَمَا تَدُورُ
> الرَّحَى، ثُمَّ يَرْتَبِطُ فِي قَعْرِهَا.\"

I swear to you by Allah that you should not be that Imam of the people
who will be killed because it has been said that, \"An Imam of this
people will be killed after which killing and fighting will be made open
for them till the Day of Judgement, and he will confuse their matters
and spread troubles over them. As a result, they will not discern truth
from wrong. They will oscillate like waves and would be utterly
misled.\" You should not behave as the carrying beast for Marwan so that
he may drag you wherever he likes, despite (your) seniority of age and
length of life.

> وَإِني أَنْشُدُكَ اللهَ أنْ تَكُونَ إِمَامَ هذِهِ الاْمَّةِ الْمَقْتُولَ، فَإِنَّهُ كَانَ يُقَالُ: يُقْتَلُ فِي
> هذِهِ الاْمَّةِ إِمَامٌ يَفْتَحُ عَلَيْهَا الْقَتْلَ وَالْقِتَالَ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقُيَامَةِ، وَيَلْبِسُ أُمُورَهَا
> عَلَيْهَا، وَيَبُثُّ الْفِتَنَ فِيهَا، فَلاَ يُبْصِرُونَ الْحَقَّ مِنَ الْبَاطِلِ، يَمُوجُونَ فِيهَا مَوْجاً،
> وَيَمْرُجُونَ فِيهَا مَرْجاً. فَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ لِمَرْوَانَ سَيِّقَةً يَسُوقُكَ حَيْثُ شَاءَ بَعْدَ جَلاَلَ السِّنِّ
> وَتَقَضِّي الْعُمُرِ.

Then 'Uthman said to Amir al-mu\'minin: \"Speak to the people to give me
time until I redress their grievances.\" Amir al-mu\'minin then said:
\"So far as Medina is concerned here is no question of time. As for
remoter areas you can have the time needed for your order to reach
there.\"

> فَقَالَ لَهُ عُثْـمَانُ: كَلِّمِ النَّاسَ فِي أَنْ يُؤَجِّلُونِي، حَتَّى أَخْرُجَ إِلَيْهِمْ مِن مَظَالِمِهِمْ،
> فَقال(عليه السلام): مَا كَانَ بِالْمَدِينَةِ فَلاَ أَجَلَ فِيهِ، وَمَا غَابَ فَأَجَلُهُ وُصُولُ
> أَمْرِكَ إِلَيْهِ.

-  During the
    Caliphate of \`Uthman when the Muslims were weary of the oppression
    of the Government and its officials collected in Medina to complain
    to the senior companions of the Prophet, they came to Amir
    al-mu\'minin in a peaceful manner and requested him to see \`Uthman
    and advise him not to trample on the Muslims\' rights and to put an
    end to the troubles which were proving the cause of the people\'s
    ruin, whereupon Amir al-mu\'minin went to him and uttered these
    words.\
    In order to make the bitterness of the admonition palatable Amir
    al-mu\'minin adopted that way of speech in the beginning which would
    create a sense of responsibility in the addressee and direct him
    towards his obligations. Thus, by mentioning his companionship of
    the Prophet, his personal position, and his kinship to the Prophet
    as against the two previous Caliphs, his intention was to make him
    realise his duties; in any case, this was obviously not an occasion
    for eulogising him, so that its later portion can be disregarded and
    the whole speech be regarded as an eulogy of his attainments,
    because from its very beginning it is evident that whatever \`Uthman
    did, he did it wilfully, that nothing was done without his knowledge
    or his being informed, and that he could not be held unaccountable
    for it because of his being unaware of it. If the adoption of a line
    of action which made the whole Islamic world raise hue and cry in
    spite of his having being a companion of the Prophet, having heard
    his instructions, having seen his behaviour and having been
    acquainted with the commandments of Islam can be regarded as a
    distinction, then this taunt may also be regarded as praise. If that
    is not a distinction then this too cannot be called and eulogy. In
    fact, the words about which it is argued that they are in praise are
    enough to prove the seriousness of his crime, because a crime in
    ignorance and unawareness is not so serious as the weight given to
    the seriousness of the commission of a crime despite knowledge and
    awareness. Consequently a person who is unaware of the rise and fall
    of a road and stumbles in the dark night is excusable but a person
    who is aware of the rise and fall of the road and stumbled in broad
    day light is liable to be blamed. If on this occasion he is told
    that he has eyes and is also aware of the rise and fall of the way,
    it would not mean that his vastness of knowledge or the brightness
    of his eye-sight is being praised, but the intention would be that
    he did not notice the pitfalls despite his eyes, and did not walk
    properly, and that therefore for him, having or not having eyes is
    the same, and knowing or not knowing is equal.\
    In this connection great stress in laid on his being a son-in-law,
    namely that the Prophet married his two daughters Ruqayyah and Umm
    Kulthum to him one after the other. Before taking this to be a
    distinction, the real nature of \`Uthman\'s son-in-lawship should be
    seen. History shows that in this matter \`Uthman did not enjoy the
    distinction of being the first, but before him Ruqayyah and Umm
    Kulthum had been married to two sons of Abu Lahab namely \`Utbah and
    \`Utaybah, but despite their being sons-in-law, they have not been
    included among people of position of pre-prophethood period. How
    then can this be regarded as a source of position without any
    personal merit, when there is no authority about the importance of
    this relationship, nor was any importance attached to this matter in
    such a way that there might have been some competition between
    \`Uthman and some other important personality in this regard and
    that his selection for it might have given him prominence, or that
    these two girls might have been shown to possess an important
    position in history, tradition or biography as a result of which
    this relationship could be given special importance and regarded as
    a distinction for him? If the marriage of these two daughters with
    \`Utbah and \`Utaybah in the pre-prophethood period is held as
    lawful on the ground that marriage with unbelievers had not till
    then been made unlawful, then in \`Uthman\'s case also the condition
    for lawfulness was his acceptance of Islam, there is no doubt that
    he had pronounced the kalimah ash-shahadatayn (there is no god but
    Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger) and had accepted Islam
    outwardly. As such this marriage can be held a proof of his outward
    Islam, but no other honour can be proved through it. Again, it is
    also not agreed that these two were the real daughters of the
    Messenger of Allah, because there is one group which denies them to
    be his real daughters, and regards them as being the daughters of
    Khadijah\'s sister Halah, or the daughters of her own previous
    husband. Thus, Abu\'l-Qasim al-Kufi (d. 352 A.H.) writes:\
    \"When the Messenger of Allah married Khadijah, then some time
    thereafter Halah died leaving two daughters, one named Zaynab and
    the other named Ruqayyah and both of them were brought up by the
    Prophet and Khadijah and they maintained them, and it was the custom
    before Islam that a child was assigned to whoever brought him up.\"
    (al-lstighathah, p. 69)\
    Ibn Hisham has written about the issues of Hadrat Khadijah as
    follows:\
    \"Before marriage with the Prophet she was married to Abi Halah ibn
    Malik. She delivered for him Hind ibn Abi Halah and Zaynab bint Abi
    Halah. Before marriage with Abi Halah she was married to \`Utayyiq
    ibn \`Abid ibn \`Abdillah ibn \`Amr ibn Makhzum and she delivered
    for him \`Abdullah and a daughter.\" (as-Sirah an-nabawiyyah, vol.
    4, p. 293)\
    This shows that of Hadrat Khadijah had two daughters before being
    married to the Prophet and according to all appearance they would be
    called his daughters and those to whom they were married would be
    called his sons-in-law, but the position of this relationship would
    be the same as if those girls were his daughters. Therefore, before
    putting it forth as a matter for pride the real status of the
    daughters should be noted and a glance should be cast at \`Uthman\'s
    conduct. In this connection, al-Bukhari and other narrators (of
    traditions) and historians record this tradition as follows:\
    Anas ibn Malik relates that: \"We were present on the occasion of
    the burial of the Prophet\'s daughter Umm Kulthum, while the Prophet
    was sitting beside her grave. I saw his eyes shedding tears. Then he
    said, \'Is there any one among you who has not committed a sin last
    night?\' Abu Talhah (Zayd ibn Sahl al-Ansari) said, \'I\', then the
    Prophet said, \'Then you get into the grave,\' consequently he got
    down into the grave.\"\
    The commentators said about \'committed sin\' that the Holy Prophet
    meant to say \'one who had not had sexual intercourse.\' On this
    occasion the Holy Prophet unveiled the private life of \`Uthman and
    prevented him from getting down into the grave, although it was a
    prominent merit of the Prophet\'s character that he did not disgrace
    or belittle any one by making public his private life, and despite
    of knowledge of others\' shortcomings, ignored them; but in this
    case the filth was such that it was deemed necessary to disgrace him
    before the whole crowd.\
    Since \`Uthman did not show any regard for the demise of his wife
    (Umm Kulthum) nor was he moved or felt sorry (for this event), and
    paid no heed to the cutting off his relationship with the Holy
    Prophet (for being his son-in-law), he (\`Uthman) had sexual
    intercourse on the same night, therefore the Holy Prophet deprived
    him of this right and honour. (al-Bukhari, as-Sahih, vol. 2, pp.
