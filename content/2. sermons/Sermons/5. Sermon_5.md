*Delivered when the Holy Prophet died and 'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib
and Abu Sufyan ibn Harb offered to pay allegiance to Amir al-mu'minin
for the Caliphate*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام) لمّا قبض رسول الله(صلى الله عليه وآله)

> وخاطبه العباس وأبوسفيان في أن يبايعا له بالخلافة

> (وذلك بعد أن تمّت البيعة لابي بكر في السقيفة، وفيها ينهى عن الفتنة
> ويبين عن خلقه وعلمه):

O People\!{#epub.html_fref_0d246a45_1
.see-footnote}

Steer clear through the waves of mischief by boats of deliverance, turn
away from the path of dissension and put off the crowns of pride.
Prosperous is one who rises with wings (i.e. when he has power) or else
he remains peaceful and others enjoy ease. It (i.e. the aspiration for
Caliphate) is like turbid water or like a morsel that would suffocate
the person who swallows it. One who plucks fruits before ripening is
like one who cultivated in another's field.

> النهي عن الفتنة

> أَيُّها النَّاسُ، شُقُّوا أَمْوَاجَ الفِتَنِ بِسُفُنِ النَّجَاةِ، وَعَرِّجُوا عَنْ طَريقِ الـمُنَافَرَةِ،
> وَضَعُوا تِيجَانَ الـمُفَاخَرَةِ. أَفْلَحَ مَنْ نَهَضَ بِجَنَاح، أوِ اسْتَسْلَمَ فَأَراحَ، مَاءٌ آجِنٌ،
> وَلُقْمَةٌ يَغَصُّ بِهَا آكِلُهَا، وَمُجْتَنِي الَّثمَرَةِ لِغَيْرِ وَقْتِ إِينَاعِهَا كالزَّارعِ بِغَيْرِ أَرْضِهِ.

If I speak out they would call me greedy towards power but if I keep
quiet they would say I was afraid of death. It is a pity that after all
the ups and downs (I have been through). By Allah, the son of Abu
Talib{#epub.html_fref_0b43519b_2
.see-footnote} is more familiar with death than an infant with the
breast of its mother. I have hidden knowledge, if I disclose it you will
start trembling like ropes in deep wells.

> خلقه وعلمه

> فَإِنْ أقُلْ يَقُولُوا: حَرَصَ عَلَى الـمُلْكِ، وَإنْ أَسْكُتْ يَقُولُوا: جَزعَ مِنَ المَوْتِ! هَيْهَاتَ
> بَعْدَ اللَّتَيَّا وَالَّتِي! وَاللهِ لاَبْنُ أَبي طَالِب آنَسُ بالمَوْتِ مِنَ الطِّفْلِ بِثَدْي أُمِّهِ، بَلِ
> انْدَمَجْتُ عَلَى مَكْنُونِ عِلْم لَوْ بُحْتُ بِهِ لاَضْطَرَبْتُمُ اضْطِرَابَ الاْرْشِيَةِ في الطَّوِيِّ
> البَعِيدَةِ!

-  When the Holy
    Prophet died Abu Sufyan was not in Medina. He was coming back when
    on his way he got the news of this tragedy. At once he enquired who
    had become the leader and Chief. He was told that people had paid
    allegiance to Abu Bakr. On hearing this the acknowledged
    mischief-monger of Arabia went into deep thought and eventually went
    to \`Abbas ibn \`Abd al-Muttalib with a proposal. He said to him,
    \"Look, these people have by contrivance made over the Caliphate to
    the Taym and deprived Banu Hashim of it for good, and after himself
    this man would place over our heads a haughty man of Banu \`Adi. Let
    us go to \`Ali ibn \`Abi Talib and ask him to get out of his house
    and take to arms to secure his right.\"]

    So taking \`Abbas with him he came to \`Ali and said: \"Let me your
    hand; I pay allegiance to you and if anyone rises in opposition I
    would fill the streets of Medina with men of cavalry and infantry.\"
    This was the most delicate moment for Amir al-mu\'minin. He regarded
    himself as the true head and successor of the Prophet while a man
    with the backing of his tribe and party like Abu Sufyan was ready to
    support him. Just a signal was enough to ignite the flames of war.
    But Amir al-mu\'minin\'s foresight and right judgement saved the
    Muslims from civil war as his piercing eyes perceived that this man
    wanted to start civil war by rousing the passions of tribal
    partisanship and distinction of birth, so that Islam should be
    struck with a convulsion that would shake it to its roots.

    Amir al-mu\'minin therefore rejected his counsel and admonished him
    severely and spoke forth the words, whereby he has stopped people
    from mischief mongering, and undue conceit, and declared his stand
    to be that for him there were only two courses - either to take up
    arms or to sit quietly at home. If he rose for war there was no
    supporter so that he could suppress these rising insurgencies. The
    only course left was quietly to wait for the opportunity till
    circumstances were favourable.

    Amir al-mu\'minin\'s quietness at this stage was indicative of his
    high policy and far-sightedness, because if in those circumstances
    Medina had become the centre of war its fire would have engulfed the
    whole of Arabia in its flames. The discord and scuffle that had
    already begun among muhajirun (those who came from Mecca) and ansar
    (the locals of Medina) would have increased to maximum, the
    wire-pullings of the hypocrites would have had full play, and
    Islam\'s ship would have been caught in such a whirlpool that its
    balancing would have been difficult; Amir al-mu\'minin suffered
    trouble and tribulations but did not raise his hands.

    History is witness that during his life at Mecca the Prophet
    suffered all sorts of troubles but he was not prepared to clash or
    struggle by abandoning patience and endurance, because he realised
    that if war took place at that stage the way for Islam\'s growth and
    fruition would be closed. Of course, when he had collected
    supporters and helpers enough to suppress the flood of unbelief and
    curb the disturbances, he rose to face the enemy. Similarly, Amir
    al-mu\'minin, treating the life of the Prophet as a torch for his
    guidance refrained from exhibiting the power of his arm because he
    was realising that rising against the enemy without helpers and
    supporters would become a source of revolt and defeat instead of
    success and victory.

    Therefore, on this occasion Amir al-mu\'minin has likened the desire
    for Caliphate to turbid water or a morsel suffocating the throat.
    Thus, even where people had forcibly snatched this morsel and wanted
    to swallow it by forcible thrusting, it became stuck in their
    throat. They could neither swallow it nor vomit it out. That is,
    they could neither manage it as is apparent from the blunders they
    committed in connection with Islamic injunctions, nor were they
    ready to cast off the knot from their neck.

    He reiterated the same ideas in different words thus: \"If had I
    attempted to pluck the unripe fruit of Caliphate then by this the
    orchard would have been desolated and I too would have achieved
    nothing, like these people who cultivate on other\'s land but can
    neither guard it, nor water it at proper time, nor reap any crop
    from it. The position of these people is that if I ask them to
    vacate it so that the owner should cultivate it himself and protect
    it, they say how greedy I am, while if I keep quiet they think I am
    afraid of death.

    They should tell me on what occasion did I ever feel afraid, or flew
    from battle-field for life, whereas every small or big encounter is
    proof of my bravery and a witness to my daring and courage. He who
    plays with swords and strikes against hillocks is not afraid of
    death. I am so familiar with death that even an infant is not so
    familiar with the breast of its mother. Hark! The reason for my
    silence is the knowledge that the Prophet has put in my bosom. If I
    divulge it you would get perplexed and bewildered. Let some days
    pass and you would know the reason of my inaction, and perceive with
    your own eyes what sorts of people would appear on this scene under
    the name of Islam, and what destruction they would bring about. My
    silence is because this would happen, otherwise it is not silence
    without reason.\"

    A Persian hemistch says: \"Silence has meaning which cannot be
    couched in words.\"

-  About death Amir
    al-mu\'minin says that it is so dear to him that even an infant does
    not so love to leap towards the source of its nourishment while in
    its mother\'s lap. An infant\'s attachment with the breast of its
    mother is under the effect of a natural impulse but the dictates of
    natural impulses change with the advance of age. When the limited
    period of infancy ends and the infant\'s temperament changes, he
    does not like even to look at what was so familiar to him but rather
    turns his face from it in disgust.]

    But the love of prophets and saints for union with Allah is mental
    and spiritual, and mental and spiritual feelings do not change, nor
    does weakness or decay occur in them. Since death is the means and
    first rung towards this goal their love for death increases to such
    an extent that its rigours become the cause of pleasure for them and
    its bitterness proves to be the source of delight for their taste.

    Their love for it is the same as that of the thirsty for the well or
    that of a lost passenger for his goal. Thus when Amir al-mu\'minin
    was wounded by \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muljam\'s fatal attack, he said,
    \"I was but like the walker who has reached (the goal) or like the
    seeker who has found (his object) and whatever is with Allah is good
    for the pious.\" The Prophet also said that there is no pleasure for
    a believer other than union with Allah.
