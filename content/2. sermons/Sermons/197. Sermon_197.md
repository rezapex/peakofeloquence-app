*Amir al-mu\'minin\'s attachment to the Holy Prophet. The performance of
his funeral rites.*

> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام)

> ينبّه فيها على فضيلته لقبول قوله وأمره ونهيه

Those companions of Muhammad - the peace and blessing of Allah be upon
him and his descendants - who were the custodians (of divine messages)
know that I never disobeyed Allah or His Messenger
 -
the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him and his descendants - at
all, and by virtue of the courage

with which Allah honoured me I supported him with my life on occasions
when even the brave turned away and feet remained behind (instead of
proceeding forward).

> وَلَقَدْ عَلِمَ الْمُسْتَحْفَظُونَ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ مُحَمَّد(صلى الله عليه وآله) أَنِّي لَمْ أَرُدَّ عَلَى
> الله وَلاَ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ سَاعَةً قَطُّ، وَلَقَدْ وَاسَيْتُهُ بِنَفْسِي فِي الْمَوَاطِنِ الَّتي تَنْكُصُ
> فِيهَا الاْبْطَالُ وَتَتَأَخَّرُ الاْقْدَامُ، نَجْدَةً أَكْرَمَنِي اللهُ بِهَا.

When the Prophet - the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him and his
descendants - died his head was on my chest, and his (last) breath blew
over my palms and I passed it over my face. I performed his (funeral)
ablution, may Allah bless him and his descendants, and the angels helped
me. The house and the courtyard were full of them. One party of them was
descending and the other was ascending.

My ears continually caught their humming voice, as they invoked Allah\'s
blessing on him, till we buried him in his grave. Thus, who can have
greater rights with him than I during his life or after his death?
Therefore depend on your intelligence and make your intentions pure in
fighting your enemy, because I swear by Him who is such that there is no
god but He, that I am on the path of truth and that they (the enemy) are
on the misleading path of wrong. You hear what I say; and I seek
Allah\'s forgiveness for myself and for you.

> وَلَقَدْ قُبِضَ رَسُولُ اللهِ (صلى الله عليه وآله) وَإِنَّ رَأْسَهُ لَعَلَى صَدْرِي. وَلَقَدْ سَالَتْ
> نَفْسُهُ فِي كَفِّي، فَأَمْرَرْتُهَا عَلَىُ وَجْهِي. وَلَقَدْ وُلِّيتُ غُسْلَهُ (صلى الله عليه وآله)
> وَالْمَلاَئِكُةُ أَعْوَانِي، فَضَجَّتِ الدَّارُ والاْفْنِيَةُ، مَلاَ يُهْبِطُ، وَمَلاَ يَعْرُجُ، وَمَا فَارَقَتْ
> سَمْعِي هَيْنَمَةٌ مِنْهُمْ، يُصَلُّونَ عَلَيْهِ حَتَّى وَارَيْنَاهُ فِي ضَرِيحِهِ. فَمَنْ ذَا أَحَقُّ بِهِ مِنِّي
> حَيّاً وَمَيِّتاً؟ فَانْفُذُوا عَلَى بَصَائِرِكُمْ، وَلْتَصْدُقْ نِيَّاتُكُمْ فِي جِهَادِ عَدُوِّكُمْ، فَوَالَّذِي لاَ
> إِلهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ إِنِّي لَعَلَى جَادَّةِ الْحَقِّ، وَإِنَّهُمْ لَعَلَى مَزَلَّةِ الْبَاطِلِ. أَقُولُ مَا تَسْمَعُونَ،
> وَأَسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ لِي وَلَكُمْ!

-  Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid
    has written (in Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 10, pp. 180-183) that
    Amir al-mu\'minin\'s saying that he never disobeyed the commands of
    the Prophet is a sort of taunt to those who felt no hesitation in
    rejecting the Prophet\'s commands and sometimes even checked him.
    For example, when, at the time of the peace of al-Hudaybiyah, the
    Prophet was agreeable to negotiate peace with the unbelievers among
    the Quraysh, one of the companions became so enraged that he
    expressed doubts about the prophethood of the Prophet whereupon Abu
    Bakr had to say: Woe be to you! Keep clinging to him. He is
    certainly Allah\'s Messenger and He will not ruin him.\
    The introduction to the oath, \'inna\', and the word of emphasis
    \'lam\' which are used here to create conviction about the
    prophethood shows that the addressee had gone farther than mere
    doubt, because these words of emphasis are employed only when the
    stage of denial has been reached. However, if belief required
    absence of doubt, the presence of doubt must imply defect in the
    belief, as Allah says: The believers are only those who believe in
    Allah and His Messenger, they doubt not thereafter,\... (Qur\'an,
    49:15)\
    Similarly, when the Prophet intended to say the funeral prayers of
    Ubayy ibn Salul the same companion said to him, \"How do you intend
    to seek forgiveness for this Chief of hypocrites?\" And he even drew
    away the Prophet by catching the skirt (of his shirt). Then the
    Prophet had to say, \"No act of mine is beside the command of
    Allah\". In the same way the Prophet\'s command to accompany the
    force of Usamah ibn Zayd was ignored. The greatest of all these
    insolences was displayed in connection with the Prophet\'s intention
    to write down his advice as to when such a blame was laid against
    the Prophet which proves an absence of belief in the commands of the
    shari\`ah, and creates a doubt about each command as to whether it
    is based on divine revelation or (Allah may forbid) just the result
    of mental disorder.]
-  Who can deny that
    the ever-successful lion of Allah, \`Ali ibn Abi Talib (p.b.u.h.)
    shielded the Prophet on every critical occasion and performed the
    duty of protecting him by dint of the courage and valour gifted to
    him by Allah. The first occasion of risking his life was when the
    unbelievers from the Quraysh decided finally to kill the Prophet and
    \`Ali slept on his bed surrounded by enemies and under the direct
    peril of swords, whereby the enemies were not able to succeed in
    their aims. Then, in those battles where the enemies used to attack
    the Prophet together and where the feet of even the reputed heroes
    could not stand firm, Amir al-mu\'minin remained steadfast with the
    banner (of Islam) in his hand. \`Abd al-Barr and al-Hakim writes
    about it:\
    Ibn \`Abbas says that \`Ali had four qualities which no one else
    possessed. Firstly, he was the first among Arabs and non-Arabs to
    have said prayers with the Messenger of Allah. Secondly, he always
    had the banner of Islam in his hand in every battle. Thirdly, when
    people ran away from the Prophet, \`Ali remained with him; and
    fourthly it was he who gave the Prophet his funeral ablution and
    laid him in his grave. (al-Isti\`ab, vol. 3, p. 1090; al-Mustadrak
    \`ala as-sahihayn vol. 3, p. 111)\
    A study of the holy wars of Islam fought in the Prophet\'s days
    leaves no doubt that, except for the battle of Tabuk in which Amir
    al-mu\'minin did not partake, all other battles bear testimony to
    his fine performance and all the successes are due to his valour.
    Thus, in the battle of Badr seventy unbelievers were killed, half of
    whom were killed by \`Ali\'s sword. In the battle of Uhud, when
    victory changed into defeat as a result of the Muslims engaging
    themselves in the collection of booty, and they fled away under the
    sudden attack of the enemy, Amir al-mu\'minin remained steadfast,
    taking jihad to be a religious obligation, and displayed such
    conspicuous performance in support and defence of the Prophet that
    the Prophet too acknowledged it and also the Angel. Again, in the
    battle of the Trench (al-Khandaq), the Prophet was accompanied by
    three thousand combatants, but none dared face \`Amr ibn \`Abdawadd.
    At last, Amir al-mu\'minin killed him and saved the Muslims from
    ignominy. In the battle of Hunayn, the Muslims were proud of their
    number because they were ten thousand while the unbelievers were
    only four thousand, but here too they leapt onto the booty, as a
    consequence of which the unbelievers gained the opportunity, and
    pounced upon them. Bewildered with this sudden attack the Muslims
    fled away as the Holy Qur\'an says:\
    Most certainly did Allah help you in many (battle) fields, and on
    the day of Hunayn, when made you vain your great number, but they
    availed you nothing, and was straitened the earth against you with
    all its extensiveness, then ye turned back in retreat. (9:25)\
    On this occasion also, Amir al-mu\'minin was steady like a rock, and
    eventually, with Allah\'s support, victory was
    achieved.]
