*About those who sit for dispensation of justice among people but are
not fit for it.*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> في صفة من يتصدّى للحكم بين الاْمة وليس لذلك بأَهل

Among{#epub.html_fref_e30a3135_1
.see-footnote} all the people the most detested before Allah are two
persons. One is he who is devoted to his self. So he is deviated from
the true path and loves speaking about (foul) innovations and inviting
towards wrong path. He is therefore a nuisance for those who are
enamoured of him, is himself misled from the guidance of those preceding
him, misleads those who follow him in his life or after his death,
carries the weight of others' sins and is entangled in his own misdeeds.

> انَّ أَبْغَضَ الخَلائِقِ إِلَى اللهِ تعالى رَجُلانِ: رَجُلٌ وَكَلَهُ اللهُ إِلَى نَفْسِهِ فَهُوَ جَائِرٌ
> عَنْ قَصْدِ السَّبِيلِ مَشْغُوفٌ بِكَلاَمِ بِدْعَةٍ وَدُعَاءِ ضَلاَلَةٍ، فَهُوَ فِتْنَةٌ لَمِنِ افْتَتَنَ بِهِ، ضَالٌّ
> عَنْ هَدْي مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَهُ، مُضِلُّ لِمَنِ اقْتَدَى بِهِ في حَيَاتِهِ وَبَعْدَ وَفَاتِهِ، حَمَّالٌ خَطَايَا
> غَيْرِهِ، رَهْنٌ بِخَطِيئَتِهِ

The other man is he who has picked up ignorance. He moves among the
ignorant, is senseless in the thick of mischief and is blind to the
advantages of peace. Those resembling like men have named him scholar
but he is not so. He goes out early morning to collect things whose
deficiency is better than plenty, till when he has quenched his thirst
from polluted water and acquired meaningless things, he sits among the
people as a judge responsible for solving whatever is confusing to the
others.

If an ambiguous problem is presented before him he manages shabby
argument about it of his own accord and passes judgement on its basis.
In this way he is entangled in the confusion of doubts as in the
spider's web, not knowing whether he was right or wrong. If he is right
he fears lest he erred, while if he is wrong he hopes he is right. He is
ignorant, wandering astray in ignorance and riding on carriages
aimlessly moving in darkness. He did not try to find reality of
knowledge. He scatters the traditions as the wind scatters the dry
leaves.

> وَرَجُلٌ قَمَشَ جَهْلاً مُوضِعٌ في جُهَّالِ الاْمَّةِ غادرٍ في أَغْبَاشِ الفِتْنَةِ، عِمٍبِمَا في عَقْدِ
> الهُدْنَةِ قَدْ سَمَّاهُ أَشْبَاهُ النَّاسِ عَالمِاً وَلَيْسَ بِهِ ، بَكَّرَ فَاسْتَكْثَرَ مِنْ جَمْعٍ، مَا قَلَّ
> مِنْهُ خَيْرٌ مِمَّا كَثُرَ، حَتَّى إِذَا ارْتَوَى مِنْ مَاءٍ آجِنٍك، وَأكْثَر مِن غَيْرِ طَائِلٍ جَلَسَ بَيْنَ
> النَّاسِ قَاضِياً ضَامِناً لِتَخْلِيصِ مَا التَبَسَ عَلَى غيْرِهِ. فَإِنْ نَزَلَتْ بِهِ إِحْدَى المُبْهَمَاتِ
> هَيَّأَ لَهَا حَشْواً رَثّاً مِنْ رَأْيِهِ، ثُمَّ قَطَعَ بِهِ، فَهُوَ مِنْ لَبْسِ الشُّبُهَاتِ في مِثْلِ نَسْجِ
> العَنْكَبُوتِ: لاَ يَدْرِي أَصَابَ أَمْ أَخْطَأَ. إنْ أَصَابَ خَافَ أَنْ يَكُونَ قَدْ أَخْطَأَ، وَإِنْ أَخْطَأَ
> رَجَا أَنْ يَكُونَ قَدْ أَصَابَ. جَاهِلٌ خَبَّاطُجَهلات، عَاشٍرَكَّابُ عَشَوَات لَمْ يَعَضَّ عَلَى العِلْمِ
> بِضِرْسٍ قَاطِعٍ، يُذرِي الرِّوَايَاتِ إذْراءَ الرِّيحِ الهَشِيمَ .

By Allah, he is not capable of solving the problems that come to him nor
is fit for the position assigned to him. Whatever he does not know he
does not regard it worth knowing. He does not realise that what is
beyond his reach is within the reach of others. If anything is not clear
to him he keeps quiet over it because he knows his own ignorance. Lost
lives are crying against his unjust verdicts, and properties (that have
been wrongly disposed of) are grumbling against him.

> لاَ مَلِيٌ وَاللهِ ـ بِإِصْدَارِ مَا وَرَدَ عَلَيْهِ، وَلاَ هُوَ أَهْلٌ لِما فُوّضَ إليه، لاَ يَحْسَبُ
> العِلْمَ في شيْءٍ مِمَّا أَنْكَرَهُ، وَلاَ يَرَى أَنَّ مِنْ وَرَاءِ مَا بَلَغَ منه مَذْهَباً لِغَيْرهِ، وَإِنْ
> أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرٌ اكْتَتَمَ بِهِلِمَا يَعْلَمُ مِنْ جَهْلِ نَفْسِهِ ، تَصْرُخُ مِنْ جَوْرِ قَضَائِهِ الدِّمَاءُ،
> وَتَعَجُّ مِنْهُ المَوَارِيثُ.

I complain to Allah about persons who live ignorant and die misguided.
For them nothing is more worthless than the Qur'an if it is recited as
it should be recited, nor anything more valuable than the Qur'an if its
verses are removed from their places, nor anything more vicious than
virtue nor more virtuous than vice.

> إِلَى اللهِ أَشْكُو مِنْ مَعْشَرٍ يَعِيشُونَ جُهَّالاً، وَيَمُوتُونَ ضُلاَّلاً، لَيْسَ فِيهمْ سِلْعَةٌ
> أَبْوَرُمِنَ الكِتَابِ إِذَا تُلِيَ حَقَّ تِلاَوَتِهِ، وَلاَ سِلْعَةٌ أَنْفَقُبَيْعاً وَلاَ أَغْلَى ثَمَناً مِنَ
> الكِتَابِ إِذَا حُرِّفَ عَنْ مَوَاضِعِهِ، وَلاَ عِنْدَهُمْ أَنْكَرُ مِنَ المَعْرُوفِ، وَلاَ أَعْرَفُ مِنَ
> المُنكَرِ.

-  Amir al-mu\'minin
    has held two categories of persons as the most detestable by Allah
    and the worst among people. Firstly, those who are misguided even in
    basic tenets and are busy in the spreading of evil. Secondly, those
    who abandon the Qur\'an and sunnah and pronounce injunctions through
    their imagination. They create a circle of their devotees and
    popularise the religious code of law concocted by themselves. The
    misguidance and wrongfulness of such persons does not remain
    confined to their own selves but the seed of misguidance sown by
    them bears fruit and growing into the form of a big tree provides
    asylum to the misguided and this misguidance goes on multiplying.
    And since these very people are the real originators the weight of
    other\'s sins is also on their shoulders as the Qur\'an says:\
    And certainly they shall bear their own burdens, and (other) burdens
    with their own burdens\... (29:13)]
