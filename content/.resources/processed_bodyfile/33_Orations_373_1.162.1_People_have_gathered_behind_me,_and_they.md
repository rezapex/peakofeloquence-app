---
# Chapter 33: Orations 373 1.162.1 People have gathered behind me, and they
have sent me to negotiate. By God, I don't know what to say! There is
nothing I know that you don't, no path I can guide you to that you are
not familiar with already. You know what we know, we have not preceded
you to something that we can tell you about, nor privately learned
something we can share. You have seen what we saw, you have associated
with God's Messenger as we did. In truth, Ibn Abī Quḥāfah and Ibn
al-Khaṭṭāb were not worthier of doing what is right than you!You are
closer to the Messenger in kinship, and you, not they, have the honor of
being his son- in-law. Fear God for the sake of your soul! By God, you
do not need to be given sight as though you were blind, or knowledge as
though you were ignorant!The roads are clear, and faith's banners stand
high. 1.162.2 Know that the best of his servants in God's eyes is a just
leader who is rightly guided and guides aright, who establishes
time-honored practices and puts to death unacceptable heresies. The
paths of the Sunnah are brightly illu- mined and have their banners.
Innovations are also clearly visible, and they too have their banners.
The worst of people in God's eyes is an unjust leader who goes astray
and leads people astray, who puts to death time-honored prac- tices and
revives abandoned heresies. I have heard the Messenger of God say, ⟨On
the day of resurrection, the unjust leader will be brought for judgment,
and he will not have a single person to help him or speak on his behalf.
He will be thrown into the Pit of Gehenna and spin there like a
millstone, then he will be tethered in its lowest point.⟩I ask you in
God's name, do not be the slain leader of this community, for it has
been said that "a leader will be slain in this community who will open
unto it the door of killing and assault till the resurrection." The
community's affairs will slide into chaos and sedi- tions will become
widespread, such that people will stop distinguishing right from wrong.
They will heave in agitated waves, disordered and confused. At your
advanced age, having neared the end of your life, don't become a camel
driven by Marwān's whim!1 1.162.3 ʿUthmān responded to ʿAlī: Talk to the
people and ask them to give me time to address their grievances. 1
Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam, who had earlier been exiled along with his father
from Medina by the Prophet, was a member of the Umayyad clan and one of
ʿUthmān's chief advisors during his caliphate. Later, he fought against
ʿAlī at the Battle of the Camel but reluctantly pledged allegiance to
him in defeat. After the death of Muʿāwiyah's grandson Muʿāwiyah ii,
Marwān became the first caliph of the Marwānid branch of the Umayyads.

375 ʿAlī replied: For grievances within Medina, there can be no
reprieve. For those from other places, you can have only as much time as
it takes for your orders to get there. 1.163 From ʿAlī's oration in
which he describes the wondrous creation of the peacock: 1.163.1 God
created wondrous creatures, living beings, inanimate bodies, still
objects, and things that move, and he set up clear testimonies to his
sublime craftsmanship and great power, impelling intellects to recognize
and submit to him. Proofs of his oneness cry out to our ears, including
the birds that he cre- ated in a multitude of forms, that he lodged in
the furrows of the earth and in the crevices of its mountain passes and
mighty crags. Possessing many kinds of
wingsanddifferentshapes,allarecontrolledbythereinof subjugation,yetsoar
in spaces within the vastness of the ether and the wide-open skies. He
brought them from non-being into being in marvelous forms. He fitted
joints to sockets and covered them with flesh. He made some birds bulky,
preventing them from rising easily into the sky, and causing them to
flutter and flap on the ground. He fashioned them all differently, in
diverse hues, with his sublime power and pre- cise craftsmanship. Some
he gave a single unadulterated color, others he dyed with a color
iridescent with the sheen of a second hue. 1.163.2 The most marvelous of
birds in the manner of its creation is the pea- cock, which is formed by
the creator in the most congruent harmony, with its colors arrayed in
the best possible way, with wings of interlacing, golden feather-shafts,
and a tail with a lengthened train. When it approaches the hen, the
peacock spreads out the folds of its tail and lifts it high over its
head, like a Dārī sail hoisted by a boatman.1 It struts haughtily in its
many colors and swag- gers dragging its train. It mates in the manner of
the cockerel, leaping onto the female and inseminating it. I relate this
to you from observation, not as one whose narrations are based on weak
attribution.2 Even if it were the case, as some believe, that the
peacock inseminates through a teardrop emitted by its tear ducts and
poised on the edge of its eyelids, and that the female imbibes it 1 Dārī
is a relative adjective from Dārīn, the name of the main settlement on
an island near Qaṭīf,ontheeasterncoastof
present-daySaudiArabia.Inpre-IslamicandearlyIslamictimes, Dārīn was the
main port of Bahrain, through which musk was imported from India. Yāqūt,
Muʿjam al-buldān, 2:432, s.v. "Dārīn"; B 549; Ḥ9:268. 2 Although not
native to the Arabian Peninsula, peacocks were common in the Persian
empire, and the commentators state that ʿAlī would have seen them in
Kufa. Ḥ9:270; Jāḥiẓ, Ḥayawān 7:170, 186. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015)

1: Orations 377 then lays eggs,1 rather than through insemination by a
male with a fluid other than his teardrop, that would not be more
marvelous than the mating of crows through mutual feeding.2 You would
think the shafts of the peacock's feathers silver combs and the
astonishinghalosandsunsthatsproutfromthemcoinsof puregoldandshards of
green emerald! If you were to compare them to the earth's produce, you
would call it a bouquet of spring flowers. If you were to liken them to
garments, you would say they are an embroidered robe, or a beautiful
Yemeni turban. If you were to equate them with jewelry, they would be
bezelled gemstones of different colors rimmed with studs of silver. The
peacock struts, haughty and exultant, it fans its tail and wings and
laughs out loud, relishing its beautiful dress and its many-hued scarf.
But when it looks at its legs, it cries out in pain with a voice that
reveals its need for help and testifies to its real suffering, for its
legs are scrawny, like the legs of a drab cockerel, and a small spur
juts out fromitsshinbone.Initscrest,though,ithasabeautifulcrownof
greenfeathers, while the curve of its neck is shaped like the mouth of a
water-jug, and under- neath, its belly is like the cobalt-blue dye of
Yemen, or like silk cloth draped on a polished mirror. It appears
wrapped in a veil of purest black, except that its luster is so intense
and its sheen so bright that it is as if fresh green is mixed in with
the black. At the slit of its earhole, there is a line like the fine
edge of a reed-pen, snowy white in color like the chamomile flower, and
its whiteness gleams against the blackness that prevails there. There is
hardly a color it does not have a share of, and that has not been
enhanced further by a unique polish, gleam, sheen, and radiance. It
looks like scattered flowers untouched by spring showers or full summer
suns. Sometimes, it sheds its feathers, as if stripping off its clothes;
they fall off, one by one, then grow back altogether. They fall from
their shaft-roots like leaves from a branch, then grow and connect,
until they come back the way they were before; the new colors are no
different, and not a singlecolorappearsinthewrongplace.If
youexaminejustoneof theplumules growing from the shaft, it will display
the red of a rose, the green of an emer- ald, and even at times the
yellow of pure gold. Not even the deepest of minds and the most gifted
of intellects can find a way to describe this creature, so how 1 In
Hindu mythology, peahens self-impregnate by drinking the tears of
peacocks, which are celibate (brahmachārī), and to laud ascetics, Lord
Krishna wears a peacock feather in his crown. 2 In ancient Arab
folklore, crows mate by exchanging inseminating fluid through their
beaks, and their proverb says, ⟨more hidden than the mating of a crow⟩.
Details and caveats in Ḥ 9:270; Jāḥiẓ, Ḥayawān, 3:177, 3:464, 7:244. I
have added "mating" in the translation to clarify this context.

1: Orations 379 can words be mustered to illustrate it? Even the
smallest of its parts is so splen- did that it exceeds the grasp of
imagination and surpasses the descriptions of tongues. Glory to the one
who has dazzled intellects, who has rendered them incapable of
describing a creature that he placed in the open, where eyes could
perceive its outline, shape, structure, and color! He made tongues
incapable of describing it succinctly and rendered them too weak to give
its depiction full due. Glory to the one who gave strong structures to
all creatures, from ants and gnats to whales and elephants, and who
pledged to himself that no form he has infused with spirit shall move,
without death being its end, and destruction its goal! 1.163.3 From the
same oration, describing the celestial garden: If you gaze with your
heart's eye at the wonders described for you of paradise, your soul will
loathe the marvels of this world, its sensualities, pleasures, and
gilded landscapes. You will lose yourself in heaven's rustling trees
whose roots are buried in dunes of musk on the banks of its rivers, in
the clusters of bril- liant pearls that hang from their branches, in the
fruits that burst from their sepals that can be gathered without effort
and delight the gatherer. You will see the residents of heaven's
pavilions and arcades, who are served pure honey and rich wine; they
lived in this world nobly until, at last, they settled in a permanent
home, with no further need of travels and journeys. If you were to task
your heart truly, O listener, with reaching these wondrous landscapes,
your longing soul would leave your body right now, and you would hasten
from this assembly here to the company of the people of the grave! May
God, in his mercy, place us among those whose hearts strive to reach the
abode of the pious! 1.163.4 Raḍī: Explanation of some of the rare words
in this oration: As for ʿAlī's words, "it leaps on the female and
inseminates it (wa-yaʾurru bi-mulāqaḥah)," "leaping on" alludes to
copulation; it is said, "he leaped on the woman, he leaps on her," if he
cop- ulates with her. As for ʿAlī's words, "as though it were a Dārī
sail hoisted by a boatman (ka-annahū qalʿu Dāriyyin ʿanajahu
nūṭiyyuhu)," qalʿ is a ship's canvas sheet, and Dārī is related to
Dārīn, a sea town through which perfumes are imported; "hoisted
(ʿanaja)" means he made it turn; it is said "I hoisted the female
camel;" "I hoist it a hoisting," if I make it turn; nūṭī is a seaman. As
for ʿAlī's words, "ḍaffah of its eyelids," he meant the sides of its
eyelids; ḍaffah means side. As for ʿAlī's words, "bits ( filadh) of
green emerald," filadh is the plural of fildhah, which means piece. As
for ʿAlī's words, "clus- ters of brilliant pearls (kabāʾis al-luʾluʾ
al-raṭb)," kibāsah (clusters) means bunch, ʿasālīj (branches) are tree
limbs; the singular is ʿuslūj. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and
