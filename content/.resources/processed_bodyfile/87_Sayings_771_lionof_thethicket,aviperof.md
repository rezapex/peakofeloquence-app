theravine.Heneverpresentedanargumentunless it was decisive. He never
censured anyone for what might be excused until he
hadheardthemout.Henevercomplainedof anailmentuntilhehadrecovered. He
preached only what he practiced, and never what he did not. He may have
been overcome in words, but he was never overcome in silence---he was
more eager to listen than to speak. If two options presented themselves
to him, he would look to see which appealed to his passions and do the
opposite.You, too, should emulate these character traits. Stay with
them, race to acquire them. If you cannot do them all, then know that
doing a little is better than renouncing a lot. 3.276 Even if
disobedience were not subject to punishment, you should never disobey
God, in gratitude for his many blessings. 3.277 Offering condolences to
al-Ashʿath ibn Qays on the death of his son, ʿAlī said:1 Ashʿath, it is
fitting that you mourn your son---his relationship to you makes it right
that you should mourn. But if you can bear his loss with fortitude, know
this: you can find consolation for every loss in God. Ashʿath, if you
bear your affliction with fortitude, fate will have assailed you, yes,
but you will be rewarded, whereas if you break down in shock, fate will
have assailed you any- way, and you will be punished.Your son's life
made you happy, but he was a trial for you then and a test.2 His death
has caused you grief, but it is a means for you now to earn God's mercy
and reward. 3.278 ʿAlī spoke these lines at the Messenger of God's
grave, just after burying him:3 Patience is beautiful except in our loss
of you. Shock is loathsome except in our loss of you. The calamity
brought by your death is enormous, while deaths before and after you
mean nothing. 3.279 Don't spend time with a fool. He will lure you to
his ways and try to turn you into him. 1 See also ʿAlī's expressions of
condolence to Ashʿath on the death of his brother in §3.89, and to an
unnamed relative, in §3.385. Abū al-ʿAtāhiyah paraphrased this theme in
a line of con- dolence, "You will no doubt be subject to the flow of
destiny, and either you will be rewarded for your response or a sinner"

3: Sayings 773 3.280 ʿAlī was asked, "What is the distance between East
andWest?" and he answered: The sun's day-long trek. 3.281 You have three
friends and three enemies. Your friends are your friend, the friend of
your friend, and the enemy of your enemy. Your enemies are your enemy,
the enemy of your friend, and the friend of your enemy. 3.282 A man bore
down on an enemy, putting himself in harm's way. Seeing this, ʿAlī said
to him:1 You are like one who pierces himself with a spear to kill the
man riding pillion behind. 3.283 How many lessons and how few heeded!
3.284 To argue too much is to sin, and to argue too little is to lose,
but it is impossible for a man who argues all the time to remain
godfearing. 3.285 As long as I can pray for forgiveness, I don't fear
punishment for past sins. 3.286 ʿAlī was asked, "How will God judge
people when there are so many?" and he replied:2 Just as he feeds them
though there are so many! He was then asked, "How will he judge them
when they cannot see him?" and he replied: Just as he feeds them though
they cannot see him! 3.287 Your envoy is your intellect's interpreter,
your letter your most effective spokesman. 3.288 A man who is afflicted,
whose hardship is severe, is not more in need of prayer than a man who
has been spared but has no guarantee of safety. 1 Ṭabarī (Tārīkh, 4:277)
narrates a version of this line as ʿAlī's words to a group of people in
Med- ina who were criticizing ʿUthmān in the affair of his governor in
Kufa, Walīd ibn ʿUqbah, in 30/651. 2 The man who asked is reported to be
Salmān al-Fārisī, presumably in Medina, before Salmān left for Iraq in
ʿUthmān's caliphate (r. 23--35/644--656). Ibn ʿAbd Rabbih, ʿIqd, 4:288.

775 3.289 People are children of the world, and a man can't be blamed
for loving his mother. 3.290
AbeggarisGod'smessenger,whoeverrefuseshim,refusesGod,whoever gives to
him, gives to God.1 3.291 A man with a jealous sense of honor never
fornicates. 3.292 My allotted lifespan is protection enough!2 3.293 A
man may sleep when bereaved, but he can't find sleep when looted. Raḍī:
This means that a man might endure if his sons are killed, but he cannot
endure when his wealth is plundered. 3.294 Affection among fathers
produces kinship among their sons. Kinship needs affection more than
affection needs kinship. 3.295
Bewarelestyouarousesuspicionsinbelievers'hearts,forGodhasplaced truth on
their tongues! 3.296 A person's faith is not sincere until he trusts
God's gifts more than his own possessions.3 1 Narrated by ʿAlī from the
Prophet in Nuʿmān, Daʿāʾim, 1:243. 2 Spoken at Ṣiffīn when ʿAlī's
associates asked him to be wary of Muʿāwiyah's assassins. Ṣadūq, Tawḥīd,
368. 3 Masʿūdī (Murūj, 2:417--418) reports that a suppliant came to
ʿAlī's door, and ʿAlī instructed his son Ḥasan to fetch a dirham from
his mother, Fāṭimah (this would presumably be shortly before Fāṭimah
died, in 11/632, when Ḥasan was a young child). Ḥasan came back with her
caution that they had only six dirhams, which were needed to buy flour.
ʿAlī responded with the line at hand, and told Ḥasan to bring all six
dirhams, which he proceeded to give to the beggar.The next morning, ʿAlī
bought a camel on credit for 140 dirhams, which he then resold for 200,
thus coming home with a profit of 60 dirhams, and he said to Fāṭimah
that this was a fulfilment of God's promise, ﴿منجَاءَبِالْح َ سَن َ ﴾اَ هِ لاَ
ثْمَأُرْشَعُ هَ لَ فِة « :Whoever brings one good deed shall be rewarded with ten
of its kind» (Qurʾan, Anʿām 6:160). A similar line is attributed to the
Prophet in Quḍāʿī, Shihāb, §2.34. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and

777 3.297 When Ṭalḥah and Zubayr marched on Basra, ʿAlī sent Anas ibn
Mālik to remind them of something he, Anas, had heard about the two of
them from God's Messenger. Anas wanted to evade this task, and he came
back to ʿAlī, saying, "I forgot what it was I had heard." ʿAlī
exclaimed:1 If you are lying, may God mar your face with a bright white
patch that your turban cannot conceal! Raḍī: He meant vitiligo (baraṣ).
Shortly thereafter, Anas contracted this disease, and was never seen
thereafter without a veil on his face. 3.298 Hearts are sometimes
receptive and sometimes withdrawn. When they are receptive, urge them to
the supplementary rites of worship. When they are withdrawn, let them
stay with the mandatory rites.2 3.299 The Qurʾan contains reports about
what happened before you, prophe- cies about what will come after you,
and laws about what is present among you.3 3.300 Cast back the stone to
whence it came. Only evil repels evil. 1 Some commentators (R 3:390; B
1000) say that this line, with Raḍī's contextualization, refers to
ʿAlī's sending Anas to Ṭalḥah and Zubayr before the Battle of the Camel
outside Basra in 36/656, to remind them of Muḥammad's prophetic warning,
⟨You will fight ʿAlī in battle, and you will be in the
wrong.⟩Disagreeing with the etymology, Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd (19:217--218,
cit- ing Ibn Qutaybah, Maʿārif, chapter on vitiligo, baraṣ) says the
histories do not report that ʿAlī ever sent Anas to speak with Ṭalḥah
and Zubayr. Rather, they report that ʿAlī once called out to people in
the gathering space of Kufa (sometime during his caliphate between
36/656 and 40/661), and said, "Whoever has heard God's Messenger say
about me, while he was returning
fromtheFarewellPilgrimage,⟨ForwhomsoeverIammaster,ʿAlīishismaster;God,lovethose
who love him, and hate those who hate him⟩, I ask him in God's name to
step forward and testify!" Some men stepped forward and testified that
they had been present and heard. ʿAlī said to Anas, "You were there too!
What is the matter with you?" Anas replied, "Commander of the Faithful,
I have grown old, and what I have forgotten is more than what I
remember." It was then that ʿAlī spoke the lines in the text above. 2
Similar to §3.177. 3 Masʿūdī (Murūj, 3:106) reports that Ḥārith
al-Hamdānī complained to ʿAlī that people had forsaken the Qurʾan and
were following specious hadith. ʿAlī replied that the Prophet had
informed him about upcoming seditions and instructed that people should
cleave in such times to the Qurʾan, and the saying at hand is from the
Prophet's words that ʿAlī quoted. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and

779 3.301 ʿAlī instructed his scribe, ʿUbaydallāh ibn Abī Rāfiʿ, as
follows: Thicken the ink in your inkpot, lengthen the nib of your
reed-pen, keep spaces between the lines, and bring the letters close
together. Your lettering will then be beautiful. 3.302 I am the queen
bee of the believers.1 Money is the queen bee of the depraved. Raḍī:
This means that while the depraved follow money, believers follow me,
just as honeybees follow the queen. The "queen bee (yaʿsūb)" is the
leader of the honeybees. 3.303 A Jew taunted ʿAlī, "Hardly had you
buried your Prophet, when you fell into dis- agreement!" and ʿAlī
retorted: We disagreed after him, not about him. But your feet had not
dried from the sea when you demanded of your Prophet, «"Make for us a
god like their gods!" whereby he castigated you saying, "you are an
ignorant people!"»2 3.304 ʿAlī was asked, "What force did you use to
overthrow your adversaries?" and he replied: I never met a man who
didn't help me against himself! Raḍī: ʿAlī is alluding to the terror he
would strike deep into their hearts. 3.305 ʿAlī counseled his son
Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥanafiyyah: My dear son, I fear for you if you ever fall
into poverty, so ask God to protect you from it. Poverty harms the
faith, bewilders the mind, and incites to malice. 3.306 ʿAlī replied
thus to a man who asked him about a complicated matter:3 Ask to
understand, not to challenge. An ignorant man who seeks knowledge is
almost like the learned, whereas a learned man who is overly aggressive
is almost an ignoramus. 1 ʿIzz al-Dīn Ibn al-Athīr (Usd, 5:287) states
that the Prophet made this statement about ʿAlī. 2 Qurʾan, Aʿrāf 7:138.
3 In Kufa, to a man named Ibn al-Kawwāʾ,who laterbecame one of the
leaders of the Kharijites. Māmaṭīrī, Nuzhah, 146; Jurjānī, Iʿtibār, 587.

781 3.307 ʿAbdallāh ibn al-ʿAbbās offered ʿAlī counsel in a certain
matter. ʿAlī, who had a different opinion, replied:1 You have the right
to offer counsel, and I shall give it thought. But if I decide against
it, then you will need to obey. 3.308 It is related that when ʿAlī
arrived in Kufa from Ṣiffīn, he passed by the lodg- ings of the Shibām
clan and heard women weeping loudly over their fallen warriors. One of
their leaders, Ḥarb ibn Shuraḥbīl al-Shibāmī, came out to greet ʿAlī,
who said to him:2 Do your women rule you? What is this I hear---can't
you stop their wailing? Ḥarb then began to walk alongside ʿAlī, who was
on horseback, and ʿAlī said to him: Go back inside! A man like you,
walking beside a man like me, bodes nothing but sedition for the ruler
and shame for the believer.3 3.309 FollowingtheBattleof
Nahrawān,ʿAlīwalkedoutamongtheKharijites'corpses, and he addressed them
as follows:4 What misfortune you have earned! The one who deceived you
is the one who injured you. Asked, "Who deceived them, Commander of the
Faithful?" he answered: Satan the great deceiver and their own
evil-inciting passions. The two together deceived them with false hopes,
opened their path to sin, promised them con- quest and victory, and then
pitched them into hellfire. 3.310 Beware of disobeying God in private,
for the witness is himself the judge. 1 When the Muslims had pledged
allegiance to ʿAlī in 35/656 in Medina, ʿAbdallāh ibn al-ʿAbbās advised
him to appoint Ṭalḥah as governor of Basra and Zubayr as governor of
Kufa. Ibn al- ʿAbbās also advised ʿAlī to reaffirm Muʿāwiyah as governor
of Damascus, and then, when Muʿāwiyah had pledged allegiance, to affirm
him if he continued to obey, and replace him if he stirred up dissent.
ʿAlī exclaimed, "Great God! Should I corrupt my faith with another's
worldliness!" then spoke the lines in our text. F 452; B 1004; Ṭabarī,
