# Chapter 7: Orations 169 1.43 From ʿAlī's reply to his associates who,
soon after he had sent Jarīr ibn ʿAbdallāh as envoy to Muʿāwiyah, were
urging him to make preparations for battle:1 If I prepared to battle the
Syrians while Jarīr is still with them, I would close the door to
reconciliation and eliminate the chance, were they to wish it, of a
peaceful outcome. I have given Jarīr a limit for his return, which he
should adhere to unless he is deceived or disobedient. I think we must
wait, so go slowly, although I too am not against preparing. I've
examined the eyes and nose of this affair, and flipped it over, back to
belly, and the only alternative I see to fighting is to forsake Islam.
Our community had a leader who instituted unwarranted practices, and he
gave people the opportunity to rebuke him.2 They rebuked him, then
turned hostile, and took it upon themselves to effect change. 1.44 From
an address by ʿAlī after Maṣqalah ibn Hubayrah al-Shaybānī defected to
Muʿāwiyah.Maṣqalahhadpurchasedcaptiveslavesof
theBanūNājiyahfromʿAlī'scom- mander in order to free them. When the
commander asked for payment, he reneged and fled to Syria.3 May God
strike Maṣqalah with shame! Hebehavedlikea chieftain then fledlike a
slave! No sooner had he prompted his admirers to utter his praises
before he shut their mouths, no sooner had he confirmed his extollers'
commendations before he turned round and rebuked them. Had he remained
in Iraq, I would have shown leniency and allowed him to postpone payment
until his fortunes improved. 1 ʿAlī delivered this address in Kufa,
shortly after the Battle of the Camel in 36/656. Jarīr had been
ʿUthmān's governor in Hamadān, and, when ʿAlī dismissed him, he came to
ʿAlī in Kufa and pledged allegiance. According to the sources, however,
he remained pro-Umayyad. Details of Jarīr's embassy to Muʿāwiyah in
Damascus as ʿAlī's envoy, and related events and epistles, in Ḥ3:74--91.
See also Jarīr's background with ʿAlī in Ḥ3:70--74. 2 Refers to the
third caliph, ʿUthmān (d. 35/656), who was killed in Medina by a group
of Mus- lims from Kufa and Egypt decrying his nepotism and other
shortcomings. Ḥ2:323--333, 3:1--69 (with details of these events and the
people's grievances); B 257--258. 3 This event took place after the
arbitration, in the early months of 38/658, and ʿAlī's oration was
delivered in Kufa. Maṣqalah was then ʿAlī's governor in Ardashīr. The
commander from whom he had purchased the freedom of the Banū Nājiyah
captives was Maʿqil ibn Qays al- Riyāḥī. When Maṣqalah fled to Syria,
Muʿāwiyah appointed him to several important posts. Details of these
events and people in Ḥ3:120--151; R 1:258--261; B 258; Balādhurī, Ansāb,
2:417-- 418; Ṭabarī, Tārīkh, 5:113--132 ("The Banū Nājiyah Episode"),
5:128--131; Pellat, "al-K̲h̲irrīt," ei2. See also ʿAlī's earlier epistles
to Maṣqalah chastising him for misappropriating treasury funds, §2.39
and §2.44. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -

171 1.45 From an oration by ʿAlī:1 I praise God, never uncertain of his
mercy, never empty of his favors, never doubtful of his forgiveness,
never grudging in his worship. His mercy never ends, his favors never
cease. The world is an abode whose edifice awaits destruction and whose
people await eviction. Sweetand green, she appears to the seeker as a
gift and ensnares the viewer's heart. People! Leave her with the best
provisions you can find. In life, do not ask of her more than you need,
or seek from her more than you require. 1.46 From ʿAlī's supplication
when he began the march to Syria:2 God, protect me from the hardships of
travel, a sorrowful end, and the grief of seeing my family, children,
and property in ruin. God, you are my companion in this journey and the
guardian I leave behind with my family. Only you can do both, for a man
who is left behind cannot travel as a companion, and a man who travels
as a companion cannot be left behind. Raḍī: The opening lines of this
supplication have also been narrated from God's Mes- senger.3
Beautifully completing the Prophet's, ʿAlī added his own eloquent lines:
"Only you can do both," to the end of the piece. 1.47 From an address by
ʿAlī about Kufa:4 I see you, Kufa, stretched like raw leather on display
at the Market of ʿUkāẓ, beset by calamities and plagued with tremors.
But I also know that should a tyrant intend you harm, God will engulf
him in misfortune, then send a man to kill him. 1 Two unconnected
excerpts from ʿAlī's sermon on ʿĪd al-Fiṭr or ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā, presumably
deliv- ered in Kufa in one of the four years of his caliphate between
36/656 and 40/661. Also part of this sermon is §1.28 (and its variant
recension, §1.52). B 221, 259. Baḥrānī (B 259) says it is an ʿĪd al-Fiṭr
sermon, but, if it is part of §1.52, and since §1.52.3 mentions the
sacrificial animal, it was more likely delivered on ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā. 2 ʿAlī
intoned this prayer "when he placed his foot in the stirrup," as he was
leaving from his home in Kufa to fight Muʿāwiyah in Syria. Before
praying it, he intoned the name of God and
theQurʾanicverse,«Gloriousistheonewhosubjugatedthis(mount) toouruse,
otherwisewe would not have been capable» (Qurʾan, Zukhruf 43:13:َنيِ نِرْقُمُ
هَ ل اَ ّ نُك اَمَو اَذَٰه اَ نَ لَ رَ ّخَس يِذَ ّ لٱ َناَحْبُس .) Ḥ3:166--169 (with
further prayers by ʿAlī during this march); Minqarī, Waqʿat Ṣiffīn,
132--133. 3 See, e.g., Muslim, Ṣaḥīḥ, 2:979 (§1343). 4 For examples of
"tyrants" killed in Kufa in the early Umayyad period, see B 262. On
sayings of the Prophet's family regarding "virtues of Kufa," see
Ḥ3:198--199. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -

1: Orations 173 1.48 From an oration by ʿAlī when he marched on Syria:1
I praise God whenever night spreads and darkens. I praise God whenever
stars rise and set. I praise God whose favors are never deficient and
whose gifts can never be repaid. And now to the matter at hand: I have
dispatched my vanguard and commanded them to stay close to the high bank
until I send further orders. I intend to cross this clear water and make
contact with the tribesmen who live in the lee of the Tigris. I will
recruit them to fight your enemy and increase your strength and numbers.
Raḍī: By "high bank (milṭāṭ)," ʿAlī means the path he has commanded them
to follow alongthebanksof
theEuphrates.Thewordisalsousedfortheseashore,anditsoriginal meaning is
level ground. By "clear water (nuṭfah)" he means the water of the
Euphrates, and it is a strange and marvelous expression. 1.49 From an
oration by ʿAlī: Praise God, who is concealed in unseen mysteries but
confirmed by clear signs. He is hidden from the keenest observer, yet
the eye that does not see him cannot deny his existence, while the heart
that acknowledges him cannot com- prehend him. He is lofty and nothing
is loftier than he, he is near and nothing is nearer than he, yet his
loftiness does not distance him from his creatures, while his nearness
does not place him with them. He has not revealed to intellects his true
description, but neither has he veiled them from recognizing him, which
they must do. Creation bears witness to the creator and compels the
denier to acknowledge him in his heart, but his reality is exalted above
whatever is said about him by those who liken him to his creation, or
those who deny his exis- tence. 1.50 From an oration by ʿAlī:2 Revolt
begins with the indulgence of whims and the prescription of heresies,
wherebyGod'sBookisdisobeyed,andmenfollowmenindefianceof God'sreli- gion.
If falsehood had no trace of truth, its evil would not be concealed from
observers, and if truth had no shadow of falsehood, its enemies' tongues

this oration on 5 Shawwāl 37ah (Wednesday, March 17, 658ad) at
Nukhaylah, just outside Kufa, en route to Ṣiffīn. Minqarī,Waqʿat Ṣiffīn,

numbers, and of ensuing events); Ḥ3:201 (further lines from the
oration), Ḥ3:202--215 (details of the events). 2 ʿAlī delivered this
oration in Kufa after the arbitration in 37/658. Yaʿqūbī, Tārīkh, 2:191.

175 1.51 From ʿAlī's address when Muʿāwiyah's army prevailed over his by
the Euphrates, and blocked their access to water:1 By this act, they beg
to be fed the victuals of war. You can either accept defeat and retreat,
or quench your swords' thirst for blood and your thirst for water. Death
to a life that accepts defeat! Life, in reality, is in a fighter's
death! Hark my words! Muʿāwiyah leads a band of fools and imbeciles. By
muddying reports of what happened,2 he has deceived them into exposing
their throats to fate's arrows. 1.52 From an oration by ʿAlī, parts of
which were cited earlier in a different transmis- sion. We record it
again in this transmission because of the variance between the two:3
1.52.1 Harken!The world has severed its rope and announced its end, its
favors have become strangers and it turns away in speed, it spurs its
residents to anni- hilation and drives its neighbors toward death, its
sweetness has turned bitter and its clarity has become turbid, all that
remains of it is the last few drops in the jug, the last mouthfuls
apportioned with a pebble.4 The thirsty man sucks on it in desperation,
but it does not even wet his throat. 1.52.2 Servants of God, make ready
to quit this abode, for its residents are fated to die. Let not hopes of
its permanence take hold, nor suppose your time in it to be long. By
God, if you were to moan like bereaved camel mares, supplicate like
cooing doves, and intone like praying hermits, or if you forsook
property and children to attain nearness to God, to achieve a high
station near him, or forgiveness for the sins that are recorded in his
accounts and noted by his 1 When the two armies arrived at Ṣiffīn in Dhū
al-Ḥijjah 36/ June 657, Muʿāwiyah's troops took control of the riverbank
and blocked ʿAlī's troops from the water. ʿAlī fought and prevailed.
Against the urgings of his supporters to requite like for like, ʿAlī
allowed Muʿāwiyah's troops unfettered access to drink. Minqarī, Waqʿat
Ṣiffīn, 156--162; Ḥ3:312--331; Gh 1:287. 2 I.e., by falsely accusing
ʿAlī of ʿUthmān's murder. 3 ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā sermon, as evidenced by its
reference to the sacrificial animal (§1.52.3). See also the opening
lines of this sermon---in Ṣadūq, Man lā yaḥḍuruhu, 1:518; Ṭūsī, Miṣbāḥ,
663--- which includes the "God is great" peroration typical of an Eid
sermon. The "earlier citation" was §1.28 (which is also said to be part
of §1.45: B 221, 259); the opening lines of §1.28 and §1.52.1 are
similar. 4 The reference is to a pebble (maqlah) placed in a vessel to
ration water among a group of trav- elers; for each person, water was
dripped until it covered the pebble, then he sucked those drops from the
pebble. Ḥ3:333; R 1:273; Gh 1:289. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and
