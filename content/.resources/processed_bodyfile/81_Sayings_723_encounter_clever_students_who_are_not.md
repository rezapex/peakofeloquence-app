# Chapter 81: Sayings 723 encounter clever students who are not
trustworthy, who use the instrument of religion for worldly benefit, who
attempt to use God's favors to attack his ser- vants, and his
proofstogainvictoryoverhis select. I encounterothers who have been
guided to the bearers of truth but have no real perception---doubt is
kin- dled in their hearts by the first appearance of misgivings. Hark,
neither is to be countenanced!There is a third type, enamored of carnal
pleasures, easily led to passions, or yet another, in thrall to hoarding
and collecting. Neither is mindful of
religion.Infact,theyareclosesttograzingcattle.Thisishowknowledgedies,
through the death of its bearers. But no, by God! There will always be a
person on earth who upholds God's proof---whether visible and known or
fearful and concealed---for God's proof can never be overthrown. How
many are they, and where? By God, they are few in number, but great in
stature! Through them God protects his proof, until they entrust it to
others like them, sowing it in the heartsof
theirpeers.Knowledgehasledthemtorealperception,enablingthem to touch the
spirit of certainty, to deem easy what the dissolute find difficult, and
take comfort in what the ignorant find miserable. In this world they
live in bodies whose spirits are linked tothe highest abode.They
areGod'svicegerents on his earth, who call to his religion. Ah! Would
that I could see them! You may take your leave now. 3.134 A man is
concealed behind his tongue. 3.135 The man who does not recognize his
own worth will perish. 3.136 ʿAlī said to a man who asked him for
counsel:1 Donotbeoneof
thosewhoexpectthehereafterwithoutworkorwhopostpone repentance through
complacent hopes of a long life. They talk of rejecting the world but
reveal their desire for it in their conduct. When they are given of its
stocks, they are not satisfied, when those are withheld from them, they
are angry. Incapable of gratitude for God's gifts, they want more. They
forbid oth- ers from evil but do not desist, they command others to do
good but do not perform. They love good people but do not behave like
them, they detest the wicked but resemble them.They fear death because
of their many sins yet con- tinue to do the very things that make them
fearful. If they fall ill, they repent, but once healthy, they feel
secure and resume their frolics. When fit, they are full of themselves,
but when tested, they despair. When afflicted with poverty, they
supplicate God and beg him, but when they regain affluence, they turn 1

725 away in prideful delusion. Their ego compels them to follow its
inclinations, they do not compel it to follow the path of certainty. For
others, they expect punishment for sins lesser than their own, for
themselves, they expect greater reward than their deeds have earned. If
they acquire wealth, they turn inso- lent and are seduced, if they
become poor, they despair and grow weak. They fall short in their deeds
yet make grand requests. If passions tempt them, they go ahead and sin,
postponing repentance for later. If tribulation strikes them, they cast
off the curbs of religion. They describe the world's lessons to others
but do not themselves learn. They deliver pretentious sermons but do not
take them to heart. Their words are bold, but their deeds are few. They
compete for what perishes but are generous in giving away what endures.
They see gain as loss and loss as gain. They fear death yet do nothing
in its anticipation. They consider others' sins momentous yet deem
insignificant their own numerous transgressions.They glorify their own
acts of obedience yet think the same acts contemptible when others do
them. They calumniate others and flatter them- selves. Idle talk with
the rich is dearer to them than worshipping God with the poor. They
judge others but not themselves. They counsel others but delude
themselves. They expect others to obey them, yet they disobey. They
expect full measure but do not pay a fair price. When facing their Lord,
they fear his creatures. When facing his creatures, they do not fear
their Lord. Raḍī: If this book contained just these words and nothing
else, it would contain enough
effectivecounsel,far-reachingwisdom,discernmentforthosewhodiscern,andlessons
for those who see and think! 3.137 Every man faces an outcome, whether
sweet or bitter.1 3.138 Everything that moves forward turns back, and
everything that turns back is as if it never were. 3.139 Success comes
to those who are patient, even if the wait is long. 3.140 Anyone who
agrees with other people's deeds is a doer himself, and any- one who
does wrong commits two sins: the sin of committing the deed and the sin
of agreeing with those who committed it. 1 Ar. kullu -mriʾin. Or, based
on the variant reading in ms Sh, "Everything (kullu amrin) has a
consequence, whether sweet or bitter." al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015)

727 3.141 Protect your covenants and secure their fastenings.1 3.142
Obey the one you are required to obey---your failure to recognize him
will not be pardoned.2 3.143 Truly, you have been given the capacity to
see if you would but look, to be guided if you would but follow.3 3.144
Chastise your brother by being good to him. Deflect his malice by being
generous to him. 3.145 A person who frequents places of ill repute
should not blame those who suspect him of wrongdoing. 3.146 One who
gains power usurps. One who clings to his own opinion per- ishes. One
who consults mature men partakes of the fruit of their minds. One who
conceals his secret retains his options. 3.147 Poverty is the ultimate
death. 3.148 If you offer dues to a man who does not offer you yours in
return, you have offered him servile worship. 3.149 Do not obey humans
if it means that you will disobey God.4 1 From a lengthy address by ʿAlī
when Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam and several of the Freedmen of Quraysh came to
offer him allegiance after they were taken captive by ʿAlī's forces at
the Bat- tle of the Camel in 36/656. ʿAlī is reported to have exclaimed,
"Did you not pledge allegiance to me yesterday?" i.e., in Medina after
ʿUthmān's death (similar lines in §1.70). Ḥ18:372. "Fas- tenings," lit.
"pegs" (awtād) refers to "commitments," after R 3:336; or to
"trustworthy persons,"

pacts offered by disbelievers and rebels, after Ḥ18:372, citing Qurʾan,

wrote for his children and followers, thus in Kufa in 40/661 (Nuʿmān,
Daʿāʾim, 2:353). According to all the commentators, "the one you must
obey" refers to ʿAlī himself. Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd (Ḥ18:373) explains: ʿAlī
is an Imam, obe- dience to whom is mandatory according to all Muslims,
through the community's pledge,
accordingtoSunnis,andthroughtheProphet'sappointment,accordingtotheShiʿa;andwho-
ever fails to recognize his imamate will burn in hellfire; no excuse
will be deemed acceptable. 3 Included in §1.20. 4 Attributed to the

Those who are not saved by patience are slain by panic. 1 From oration
§1.4, delivered after the Battle of the Camel in 36/656, addressing
Ṭalḥah and Zubayr posthumously, as well as their defeated followers. R
136 (after Miskawayh); Ḥ1:209; B 164. 2 "Nor have I been lied to," means
I have never been lied to by the Prophet in what he informed me would
happen (B 980). This line is placed by the sources within several
orations by ʿAlī, and may have been spoken by him on various occasions:
(1) At the Battle of the Camel, out- side Basra in 36/656, responding to
a man who chastised him for fighting Muslims (Ḥ1:265,
afterAbūMikhnaf);(2)intheKufamosque,addressingamanfromBasra(Māmaṭīrī,
Nuzhah, 178); (3) at Ṣiffīn in 37/657, addressing his followers
(Minqarī,Waqʿat Ṣiffīn, 315); and (4) at the Battle of Nahrawān, in
38/658 either before the battle, or afterward, while instructing peo-
ple to look for Dhū al-Thudayyah among the Kharijites' corpses
(Ṭabarī,Tārīkh, 5:88; Nuʿmān, Manāqib, 214; Ḥ6:129, 18:368). 3 I.e., in
remorse. Reference to Qurʾan, Furqān 25:27. 4 Included in §1.16, ʿAlī's
first oration after the pledge of allegiance to him as caliph in Medina
in 35/656. Translation follows Ḥ18:371; R 3:337. Following B 980 and F
436, the line may alter- natively be translated as, "Whoever exposes his
face for the sake of truth will be killed \[by the ignorant
masses\]"---the inserted final phrase is stated explicitly in §1.16.

733 3.174 How sad, how strange! So, the caliphate can be justified
through the
Prophet'scompanionship,butnotthroughcompanionshipandkinshiptogeth- er!1
The following verses are attributed to ʿAlī in the same vein: If you
became their ruler through consultation, How is this valid when the
counsellors were absent? If you argued against your opponent through
kinship, Then another, closer than you to the Prophet, is worthier!
3.175 Every man in this world is a target at which fate shoots its
arrows, he is booty for calamity to plunder. With every sip he chokes,
with every bite he gags. He obtains no blessing without relinquishing
another, greets no new day except after bidding farewell to one from his
allotted share. We are all death's assistants, and our human forms are
quarries of doom---how can we hope to survive? Night and Day erect
nothing without swerving back to destroy what they have built, to
scatter what they have brought together!2 3.176 Son of Adam, whatever
you earn above your needs, you keep in store for another. 3.177 Hearts
have passions, there are times when they are receptive and others when
they are withdrawn. Approach them by way of their passions, then, and at
times when they are receptive, for a heart turns blind when coerced.3
3.178 When should I satisfy my rage? Should it be when I have no power
to demand vengeance and am admonished, "You should forbear!" or when I
have the power to exact retribution and am advised, "You should
forgive"? 1 Immediately after the death of the Prophet in Medina in
11/632, when Abū Bakr was sworn in as caliph. As explained in my Note on
the Edition and Translation: Previous Editions (p. 48), this is the
original text (واعجباه أتكون الخلافة بالصحابة ولا تكون بالصحابة والقرابة
,)transcribed thus in all early manuscripts I used and all medieval
commentaries I looked at. (See also lines to this effect in ʿAlī's
letter to Muʿāwiyah, §2.28.2.) In the modern print editions, it has been
corrupted to: (واعجباهأتكونالخلافةبالصحابةوالقرابة " :)How strange that
the caliphate is justified through companionship and kinship!" 2 Related
with some variants in §1.143.1. Ḥarrānī (Tuḥaf, 98) transcribes it
within the aphoristic oration titled Wasīlah. 3 First lines similar to
§3.298. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -

735 3.179 Walking past refuse on a rubbish dump, ʿAlī exclaimed: This is
what the misers hoarded! Raḍī: It is alternatively narrated that ʿAlī
exclaimed: This is what you were brawling over yesterday! 3.180 Wealth
is not lost if losing it teaches you a lesson. 3.181 Minds tire, just as
bodies tire, so seek for them wondrous novelties of wisdom.1 3.182
Hearing the Kharijites' slogan, ⟨No rule save God's!⟩ʿAlī remarked:2 The
statement is true, but the intent is false. 3.183 Describing the rabble
among people, ʿAlī said:3 When they unite, they overpower. When they
disperse, they can't be recog- nized. Raḍī: It is alternatively narrated
that what he said was this: When they unite, they harm. When they
disperse, they benefit. Raḍī: He was asked, "We know of the harm they
cause when they unite, but what is the benefit they offer when they
disperse?" and he replied: Workers return to their work, and everyone
benefits. The builder returns to building, the weaver returns to
weaving, and the baker returns to baking. 3.184 A felon, with a crowd
behind him, was brought before ʿAlī, who exclaimed:4 How contemptible
these faces seen only at the site of someone's shame! 3.185 Each person
has two angels assigned to protect him, until, when his ordained fate
approaches, they let it in. In truth, your allotted span is a pow- erful
shield.5 1 Nearly identical to §3.83. 2 In Kufa, after the arbitration
in 37/658. Yaʿqūbī, Tārīkh, 2:191; Ṭabarī, Tārīkh 5:72--73. See also
§1.40 and §1.182 and the accompanying notes. 3 Presumably in Kufa,
during ʿAlī's caliphate, 35--40/656--661. 4 Presumably in Kufa, during
ʿAlī's caliphate, 35--40/656--661. Lit. "No welcome to these faces" (lā
marḥaban bi-wujūhin). 5 A little before ʿAlī was killed in Kufa in
40/661, when a man from the Murād tribe came to him towarnhimof

3: Sayings 737 3.186 Ṭalḥah and Zubayr said to ʿAlī, "We will pledge
allegiance to you if you make us partners in your caliphate," and he
replied:1 No, but you are partners in strength and victory, and advisors
in distress and adversity. 3.187 People, fear God, for he hears what you
say and knows what you con- ceal. Hasten to prepare for death, for death
will seize you even when you stay still and remember you even if you
forget. 3.188 Don't let a recipient's ingratitude stop you from doing
good---the one who reaps no benefit from your generosity thanks you, and
you may well find more gratitude there than the ingrate withheld! «God
loves those who do good.»2 3.189
Everyvesselconstrictsasitfillsup,exceptthevesselof knowledge,which
expands. 3.190 The first reward of a man who shows restraint is that
people side with him against his boorish challenger. 3.191 If you are
not a patient man, then mimic those who are---rarely does someone mimic
people without becoming at least a little bit like them. 3.192 Whoever
takes himself to task profits, whoever neglects his soul loses, and
whoever fears God secures safety. Whoever heeds lessons discerns, who-
ever discerns understands, and whoever understands realizes the truth. 1
Presumably in Medina in 35 or 36/656, soon after the pledge of
allegiance to ʿAlī as caliph. "Victory" (istiʿānah, after Ḥ19:22, who
explains it as al-fawz wa-l-ẓafar) is an unusual denota- tion for
istiʿānah, which is more commonly used to denote "seeking aid." As Ibn
Abī al-Ḥadīd explains, though, here it is derived from the proverb, qad
jarā bnā ʿinān (⟨The two 'sons' of ʿinān⟩---i.e., two lines drawn in the
earth to frighten off birds---⟨have made their run⟩), said of one who
draws the winning arrow in a pre-Islamic game of chance; istaʿāna
al-insān ("A person performed istiʿānah", with the xth form verb of the
same root, "ʿ-W-N") is said of some- one who utters this proverb. On
Ṭalḥah's and Zubayr's pledge to ʿAlī and their subsequent breaking of
it, see Ḥ11:10--20. See also §1.203. 2 Qurʾan, Āl ʿImrān 3:134,148,
