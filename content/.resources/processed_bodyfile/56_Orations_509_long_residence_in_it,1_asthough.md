# Chapter 56: Orations 509 long residence in it,1 asthough
theyhavealreadyseen the resurrectionfulfilling its promise. These men
draw back the veil for the living, until those who heed them see what
most cannot see and hear what most cannot hear. 1.219.2 You will see the
strength of their piety if you picture them in their praiseworthy
standings and laudable sittings. You will see them as they unfold the
registers of their deeds and apply themselves to reckoning their
accounts; as they list every small and large deed they were commanded to
perform but fell short in accomplishing, and note every one they were
forbidden but trans- gressed; as they feel the weight of their sins on
their backs, but find themselves too weak to bear the burden; as they
sob then and choke with tears, and wail to one another, and cry out to
their Lord from repentance and recognition. You will see that they are
true banners of guidance and lamps in the darkness, shaded by angels,
enveloped by gentle calm, awaited by heaven's open doors. There, they
are promised seats of high honor near God---he will be pleased with
their deeds and praise their efforts, and they will surely inhale the
waft- ing fragrance of his pardon. In this world, they choose to remain
hostage to his generosity and captives to his majesty. Long repentance
has wounded their hearts and long weeping has wounded their eyes. Their
hand knocks cease- lessly at every door of divine supplication---and
surely, they petition the one whose generosity never fades, whose
suppliants are never rebuffed. O listener, call yourself to account for
your own soul! Other souls have a reckoner other than you. 1.220 From an
address by ʿAlī upon reciting, «O human, what has deceived you into
neglecting your Generous Lord?»2 1.220.1 Of all who could be questioned,
you have the most unstable arguments and the most deficient excuses,
your ignorance of yourself is extreme---O human, what has emboldened you
to sin, what has deceived you into neglect- ing your Lord, what has made
you complacent about the damnation of your soul? Will you not cure
yourself of your disease, will you not wake from your slumber, will you
not feel compassion for your own soul as you have compas- sion for
others? You see a person burning in the hot sun, and you offer him
shade. You see a person whose body is wracked with pain, and you weep
for 1 "The Barzakh," lit., "a thing that intervenes between any two
things," (Lane, Lexicon, s.v. "B-R- Z-Kh"), interpreted as the
intermediary station between life on earth and the final end in hell or
paradise. 2 Qurʾan, Infiṭār 82:6. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and

1: Orations 511 him. What has made you so stoic about your own disease,
so forbearing in your own affliction, so resigned that you do not weep
for your own soul? It is surely the most precious of all souls to you!
How is it that fear of a sudden strike in the night does not keep you
awake, when your sins have hurled you into the path of God's assaults?
Renew your resolve and vigilance, O human, cure your heart of apathy and
your eyes of slumber. Obey God and take comfort in his remembrance!
While you are turning away from him, picture him turning to you, calling
you to his forgiveness, covering you with his generosity, even as you
turn from him to another. 1.220.2 How exalted is God, how strong, how
generous! How lowly you are,
howweak,howbrazen!Youcontinuetodisobeyhimwhileyouenjoyhisshelter,
whileyouliveintheshadeof hisexpansivegenerosity,yetheneitherholdsback
his gifts nor rends the veil he has drawn. Never, even for the blink of
any eye, are you deprived of his many kindnesses---here he bestows a
favor, there he con-
cealsatransgression,hereagainheturnsacalamityawayfromyou.Howdoyou think
he will treat you then if you obey him? By God, if this situation
obtained among two individuals equal in strength and identical in power,
you would be the first to condemn yourself for your immoral traits and
wicked deeds! I say this truly: The world has not deceived you, it is
you who have chosen to
bedeceived.She,infact,hasgivenyouopencounselandfairwarning.Inallthat she
promises---of affliction attacking your body and your strength waning---
she is too true, too faithful to lie or deceive. How many counsellors
she sent have you accused of falsehood? How many reports she recounted
have you refused to believe? If you were to seek knowledge of her
reality in her empty homes and abandoned courtyards, you would discover
through these striking reminders and far-reaching counsel that the world
feels only compassion for you and deep caring. O how good a home she is
for those who don't want her as their home! How good an abode she is for
those who don't adopt her as their native land! Those who flee from the
world today are those to whom she will grant true happiness tomorrow.
This, when the earth convulses at the blast of the trumpet, when the
resurrection with its great calamities arrives, when all
followersaregivenovertotheritestheyfollowed,allworshippersaregivenover
to the deities they worshipped, and all who obeyed are given over to
those they obeyed. That day, in the realm of God's fairness and justice,
every glance of an eye, every tread of a foot, will be requited with its
due. How many arguments will be refuted on that day, how many trailing
excuses will be severed! Follow a course, then, that will support your
account and prove your claim. Take pro- visions that will remain for
you, from this place in which you will not remain. Prepare for your
journey. Seek the rain-giving lightning of salvation. Saddle the steeds
of readiness. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -
