# Chapter 65: Letters 587 the strong devour the weak, the large attack the
small. Herded and tended camels, some, but others gone loose, having
slipped their ropes and run off in unknown directions. They graze now on
foul weeds in stony valleys, no shep-
herdtowatchthem,noherdsmantoleadthemtograss.Theworldtookthemon the path
of blindness and struck down their beacons of guidance, they drifted in
her perplexities and drowned in her pleasures, they took her as their
lord and master, she toyed with them, and they dallied with her,
forgetting what was coming. But wait, go gently! Darkness will soon give
way to morning. Travelers have already arrived at the watering hole, yet
those who hasten may very well catch up. Know this: If your steeds are
Day and Night, you are driven forward even when you stand still. You cut
the distance to the destination even when you remain motionless and
calm. 2.31.16 Know this with full certainty: Your path is the path of
those before you, and you will not achieve your long hopes and surpass
your allotted lifespan, so be moderate in your pursuits and restrained
in what you seek. A pursuit often leads to deprivation: not every seeker
finds sustenance, while not every per- son of restraint is denied. Honor
yourself by rising above despicable acts, even when they lead to the
fulfilment of your passions, for there is no adequate rec- ompense for
expended honor. Do not become a slave to another when God has
createdyoufree.Whatisthegoodof somethinggoodobtainedthroughevil?Or of
ease obtained through privation? Beware lest ambition's steeds run off
with you and pitch you down at the station of destruction! If you can
arrange things such that no benefactor stands between you and God, then
do so. No matter what, you will attain your destiny and receive your
share, and a little from God is both more in quantity and greater in
worth than a lot from his creatures. Ultimately, everything comes from
him. 2.31.17 Making up for too much silence is easier than retracting
what escapes your lips. Secure your sack by tightening the strap. It is
far better to guard your property than to covet another's.

is far better for you to combine restraint with employment than to pair
wealth with dissolution. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera
