title: Orations 437 People, stand fast in your land and be patient
---
# Chapter 44: Orations 437 People, stand fast in your land and be patient
in the face of trial. Don't follow your hot tongues with drawn swords,
don't rush into something that God has not urged you to. Know that if
one of you dies in his bed, if he has recognized the right of his Lord,
his Messenger, and the Messenger's family, he dies a mar- tyr, and God
guarantees his recompense. He has earned reward for his pious intention,
and that intention is equal to him unsheathing his sword. Know that
everything has a time and a term. 1.189 From an oration by ʿAlī: Praise
God, whose praise is pervasive, whose armies are victorious, whose
greatness is exalted. I offer thanks for his multiplied blessings and
immense favors: his clemency is vast, and he pardoned; he was just in
all he ordained; he knows all that will happen and all that already has,
he originated all creatures by his knowledge, he conceived them all
through his wisdom---no imitation or instruction, no emulation of prior
artisan, no mistake made, no advisors present. I bear witness that
Muḥammad is his servant and messenger, dis- patched when people were
swamped in confusion, tossed on waves of devi- ation, led by reins of
destruction, hearts clamped in padlocks of grime. I counsel you to
piety, to be conscious of God, O servants of God, for it is God's right
that you owe to him, and it will earn you rights from God. I counsel you
to seek God's help to become pious, and seek to become pious in order to
please God. Piety is a refuge today and protection, and it is tomorrow's
path to the celestial garden. Piety's way is clear, those who walk it
profit, and he who guarantees your deposit of it is trustworthy. Piety
presented itself to past nations and will do so to those that remain.
They will have need of it tomor- row, when God recalls what he created,
takes back what he gave, and asks for an accountof
hisgifts.Buthowrarethepeoplewhowerepious,howfewwhoprac- ticed it well!
Those are the few in number, the people whom God has praised, when he
said, «few among my servants are truly grateful.»1 So dedicate your ears
to piety's call and apply your efforts to responding. Exchange your past
wrongs for it, make it your ally against foes. Use it to wake you from
your sleep, get through your days with its help. Infuse your hearts with
it, scrub off your sins with it, heal your maladies with it, outpace
your death with it. Be warned by those who squandered it, let others not
take warning from your terrible end. Hark and listen! Preserve it
carefully, people, and thereby preserve yourselves. Free yourself from
this world and focus your longings on the next. Don't scorn those
elevated by piety, don't elevate those elevated by the world. Don't look

forherrainclouds,don'tattendherspeakers,don'tanswerhercallers,don'tseek
her glitter, don't fancy her jewels---for her flashes are empty, her
speech is false, her wealth will be plundered, and her jewels will be
looted. Hark! She is but a strumpet who will pull away, a bronco that
will bolt, a liar who will betray, a churl who is ungrateful, a deviator
who shuns, who strays. Her nature is to terminate, her step causes
earthquakes, her might is equal to shame, her seri- ousness is equal to
jest, and her elevation is equal to disgrace. She is an abode of plunder
and pillage, of loot and ruin. Her people are in torment, in agony, they
rush forward, they disperse, they are confused by her roads, enmeshed by
her evils, frustrated by her tricks. Their fortresses do not protect
them, their homes spit them out, and their ruses fail them.What are they
but hamstrung fugitives, butchered meat, slaughtered limbs, and spilt
blood! Some among them bite on their hands, strike with their palms,
lean cheeks on elbows in regret. Oth- ers among them are beset by doubt
and withdraw after resolve. But the time of scheming has passed, the
hour of calamity has come, «and it is too late to escape.»1 Far be it!
Far be it! What is lost is lost, what has gone has gone, and the world
has moved on with everything that it housed. «Then, neither the sky nor
the earth weeps over them, and they are not granted a reprieve.»2 1.190
From an oration by ʿAlī known as Qāṣiʿah---"The Crusher." It is a long
oration, containing censure of Iblīs,3 and of arrogance and tribal
factionalism.4 1.190.1 Praise God, who donned robes of might and pride,
reserving them for himself and allowing them to no other, who made them
a fortress and sanc- tuary that only he inhabits, selecting them for his
own majesty and cursing all who attempt to challenge him for them. Then
he tested his cherubim to see 1 Qurʾan, Ṣād 38:3. 2 Qurʾan, Dukhān
44:29. 3 Iblīs refers to Lucifer. 4 The oration was delivered in (a)
Kufa in 38/658 during the episode with Muʿāwiyah's envoy Ibn al-Ḥaḍramī
in Basra (see note at §2.29), with ʿAlī rebuking his followers,
particularly cer- tain individuals from the Tamīm and Azd tribes for
bickering among themselves when they had a common enemy to fight
(Thaqafī, Ghārāṭ, 2:394--396); or (b) sometime in the last few months of
ʿAlī's caliphate, after the Battle of Nahrawān when there was tribal
strife in Kufa,

out to the tribes and delivered this oration from the back of his camel;
