# Chapter 20: Orations 253 1.95 From an address by ʿAlī:1 By God, they will
continue thus until they commit every forbidden act and untie every
knot, until not one brick house and not one goat-hair tent remains
unpenetrated by their tyranny or uprooted by their corrupt herding,
until two weepers stand up to weep, one weeping over his religion,
another weeping over his possessions, and until, if one of you seeks
vengeance on one of them, he will be a slave seeking vengeance upon his
master,2 obeying if present and slander- ing if absent. The richest of
you will be the person who places his trust entirely in God. Remember
this: If God grants you his protection accept it, and if he tests you be
patient, for «the best outcome is reserved for the pious.»3 1.96 From an
oration by ʿAlī:4 We praise him for favors past and seek his help for
what is to come. We ask him to grant us vigor in our faith, just as we
ask him to grant us vigor in our bod- ies. I counsel you to reject the
world, for she will reject you despite your dislike of leaving her and
cause your bodies to decay despite your wish for renewal. You and she
are like a band of travelers who seem already to have crossed the path
they traverse, who seem already to have reached the mountain they are
headed for. How likely it is that if you race your steed toward a goal,
you will soon attain it! How likely it is that your life today will not
continue into tomor- row! For you are driven on by a pursuer who will
not relent until he makes you leave the world. Don't compete for the
world's might and glories, don't be cap- tivated by her beauty and
delights or shaken by her injuries and sorrows, for her might and
glories will be cut off, her beauty and delights will cease, and her
injuries and sorrows will end. Each period of her time will end, and
every being living in her will perish. Doesn't the evidence of earlier
peoples and the exam- ple of your own ancestors alarm and enlighten you?
If you would only reflect! 1 Excerpt from an oration---preceded,
according to Ibn Qutaybah (Imāmah, 1:174), by §1.124, and including
§1.140---delivered at Ṣiffīn (in 37/657), when some of ʿAlī's associates
told him about how Muʿāwiyah lavishly rewarded his supporters and urged
him to do the same (Ḥar- rānī, Tuḥaf, 185). This section concerns the
Umayyads' tyranny and corruption (B 405; Ḥ 7:78--79). 2 Similar language
in §1.90.4, also about the Umayyads, interpreted as ineffectiveness
against them. Ḥ7:55; B 397. 3 Qurʾan, Hūd 11:49. 4 Friday sermon
delivered early in ʿAlī's caliphate, presumably in Medina in 35/656. R
1:438. Iskāfī (Miʿyār, 271) cites some lines in a passage that he says
"ʿAlī used to call out every night in
araisedvoice."Thelastparagraphisalsocitedaspartof anoration(of
which§1.202isanother part) in the mosque in Basra, a few days after the

255 Haven't you seen that those who pass away don't return, and that
you, their heirs, will not remain forever? Don't you see the people of
this world, at dusk and at dawn, in disparate states? One dead and
lamented, another bereaved, one struck and afflicted, another giving up
the ghost, one who seeks this world when death seeks him, another
heedless who goes not unheeded? In truth, those who remain walk in the
traces of those who have passed. Hark! Before you rush to do evil,
remember the destroyer of pleasures, the slasher of pas- sions, and the
slayer of hopes. Seek God's help in offering him what you owe for his
incalculable blessings and abundant favors. 1.97 From an oration by
ʿAlī:1 Praise God who extended his grace to all creatures and stretched
out his hand to them with generous gifts. We praise him in all his
affairs and seek his help in guarding his rights. We bear witness that
there is no god other than he, and that Muḥammad is his servant and
messenger, whom he sent to transmit his command and express his
remembrance. He discharged the trust with honor, and died having guided
us, having bequeathed to us the banner of truth; who- ever gets ahead of
it strays, whoever holds back from it perishes, and whoever remains
beneath it catches up with those who have gone ahead.The guide who
carries it is deliberate when speaking, measured when rising, and swift
once risen,2 but when you have bent your necks to him fully and pointed
toward him with your fingers,3 death will come to him, and he will be
taken away. You will remain after him in this manner for as long as God
wills, until he brings to you one who will unite you again and gather
your scattered fragments. So do not keep hoping for a man to step up who
is not going to, but do not despair of one who has turned away. Though
he may have turned away because one foot slipped, the other could be
stable, and both feet could once again stand firm. Hark! Muḥammad's
descendants are like stars in the firmament: if one sets, another rises.
The time is near and has almost arrived---the time when God's blessings
will reach perfection, and when he will show you what you hope to see.
1.98 From one of ʿAlī's orations containing narratives of epic
fighting:4 1 ʿAlī's third Friday sermon delivered after becoming caliph,
presumably in Medina, 35/656. Ḥ 7:93. 2 Referring to himself. Ḥ7:85; B
408. 3 The commentaries state that "pointing with fingers" means that
"people recognized ʿAlī as ruler." Ḥ7:94; B 408. 4 Part of an
oration---that includes §1.99 and §1.126---which ʿAlī delivered in Basra
immedi- ately after the Battle of the Camel in 36/656. B 480; ʿAbd

257 1.98.1 He is the first before every first and the last after every
last, his firstness dictates that he has no beginning, and his lastness
dictates that he has no end. I bear witness that there is no god but
God; my thoughts match my declaration, my heart matches my tongue.
1.98.2 People! «Let not your enmity of me drive you to accuse me of
lies»1 or seduce you into disobeying me---and do not look at one another
so when you hear me speak these words! I swear by him who split open the
seed and created the living being that what I say to you comes from the
Prophet---that speaker did not lie, and this listener did not forget.
1.98.3 AwickedmanwillcallouttohisflockinSyriaandscrapesthegroundfor his
banners to roost in the hinterlands of Kufa---I can almost see him!2
When his maw has opened wide, his defiance has become strong, and he
stamps his feet with violence, sedition will sink its fangs into the
city's children, waves of war will swell, the days will scowl, and the
nights will maim. Then, with sedi- tion's fruit fully ripened, its
thunderclaps booming and its lightning flashing, its obdurate banners
will become ranged in tight ranks and march like the dark
night,likethesurgingsea.Allthiswillhappen.Howmanywindswillsweepinto
Kufa! How many storms will lash into her! Soon, very soon, horn will
lock with horn. All who stand will be harvested, and all that is
harvested will be crushed. 1.99 From an oration by ʿAlī with similar
content:3 1.99.1 On that day, God will assemble all who went before and
all who came after, standing, necks bowed, to be interrogated for the
judgment and receive payback for their deeds. Sweat will streak their
cheeks like straps of a bridle, and the ground beneath them will
tremble. The best any man can hope for is space for his feet and room
for his frame.4 1 Qurʾan, Hūd 11:89. 2

1: Orations 259 1.99.2 From the same oration:1 Seditions will approach
like hosts of darkness---no horse will be able to with- stand them, and
no banner of theirs will be repelled. Advancing like bridled and saddled
warhorses, they will be urged on by their drivers, and pushed hard by
their riders, a rabid group with little appetite for stopping at
plunder. Those who fight them for God will be a force deemed lowly by
the arrogant, unrecog- nized on earth but eminent in the hereafter.
Basra, you will be afflicted at that time with an army that brings God's
chastisement, an army that neither raises dust nor makes any sound.Your
inhabitants will be stricken with red death and black hunger. 1.100 From
an oration by ʿAlī:2 1.100.1 Look at the world with the eyes of those
who have little interest in her and who turn away from her. By God, she
will soon evict her tenants and afflict the complacent and secure.That
part which turns away and leaves never returns, while that part which
you think is approaching is not guaranteed to arrive. Her happiness is
blemished with grief, and men's strength, as they con- tinue to live in
her bosom, deteriorates intoweaknessand incapacity. Do not be beguiled
by her many beauties, for her companionship is short-lived. May God have
mercy on the man who reflects and takes heed, and who, taking heed,
discerns! In a short while, it will be as though this world never was,
as if the hereafter has already come. All that is tallied will run out,
all that is expected will be, and all that will be is at hand. 1.100.2
From the same oration: The learned man knows his worth---suffice it as a
mark of ignorance when a man does not know his worth. Among the most
hateful of men in God's eyes is a person whom God has given up on, a
person he has left to his own devices, who strays from the straight
path, and wanders without a guide. If called on to cultivate the fields
of this world, he works hard, but if called on to cultivate the fields
of the hereafter, he is lazy. He behaves as though the things he works
for are mandatory, but the things in which he is remiss are an
unpleasant burden that he is not required to carry. 1

261 1.100.3 From the same oration: A time will come when only humble
believers are safe,1 not recognized if present and not missed when
absent. They are lamps of guidance and way- marks for travelers, never
gossipmongers or blabbering slanderers. God will open the gates of his
mercy for them and offer protection from the blows of his punishment.
People! A time will come upon you when Islam is overturned, just as a
vessel is overturned, with its water poured away. People! God has
promised to protect you against his injustice, but he has not promised
to protect you against his trials. He, the most glorious of speakers,
has said: «Truly there are signs in that, truly we shall put you to the
test.»2 1.100.4 Raḍī: By the words, "every humble believer (kullu
muʾminin nūmah)," ʿAlī meant a person whom no one mentions and who does
no one harm. "Masāyīḥ(gossip- mongers)" is the plural of misyāḥ, one who
goes around spreading discord and defama- tion. "Madhāyīʿ (slanderers)"
is the plural of midhyāʿ, one who, whenever he hears of a person having
committed an immoral act, circulates and disseminates it. "Budhur
(blabberers)" is the plural of badhūr, one whose levity is excessive and
whose speech is nonsensical. 1.101 From an oration by ʿAlī of which some
parts have previously been cited in a vari- ant form:3
GodsentMuḥammadasaprophetwhennoArabreadscriptureorclaimedrev- elation
and prophecy. Mustering those who obeyed him, he fought those who
disobeyed, herding all to their place of refuge and hastening to set
them on the right path before the final hour arrived. He raised the
weary and nurtured the broken, until, except for those bereft of any
good who perished, he had guided them all to their goal, shown them
their refuge, and brought them into a safe enclosure, where their
handmills spun and their lances straightened. By God, I was one of those
who fought the Age of Ignorance until its battalions fled and Islam's
forces were corralled,4 never holding back out of weakness, cow- ardice,
disloyalty, or impotence. By God, I shall impale falsehood's torso until
truth emerges from its flank. 1 Ar. nūmah, translated here as "humble,"
is alternatively vocalized as nuwamah, "those who sleep a lot." B 414. 2
Qurʾan, Muʾminūn 23:30. 3 This oration is a variant of §1.33, specified
there as delivered "when ʿAlī marched on the peo- ple of Basra." See
also Mufīd, Irshād, 247. 4 This line contains only pronouns, which I
have replaced based on the commentaries: "Age of Ignorance" for "the
earlier age," and "Islam's forces" for "our forces." Ḥ7:116; B 415; R
339; Gh 2:108. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -

1: Orations 263 1.102 From an oration by ʿAlī:1 1.102.1 God sent
Muḥammad as a witness, a herald, and a warner.2 As a child, he was the
best of the entire world, as a man, the most noble, purest of the pure
in character, the most generous of all rainclouds. Until he came,3 you
had neither tasted the world's sweetness nor succeeded in milking its
teats. But afterward, when its halter was loose and its girth slack,4
some of you turned what he had forbidden into a «laden lote tree»,5 and
what he had made law- ful into a distant fancy. You found the world to
be a cool, spreading shade: the
earthdefenselessbeforeyouraggression,yourhandsreachingouttograbitand the
hands of just leaders restrained, your swords on their necks, their
swords forcibly sheathed. Be warned! For every life taken vengeance will
be sought, for
everyrightabusedredresswillbepursued.OuravengerisnoneotherthanGod, who
will be both petitioner and judge. No one he seeks eludes him, no one
who fleesescapes.ByGod,Umayyads!Soonyouwillseeruleinthehandsof another,
in the house of your enemy. Listen now! For the keenest eye kens good
and the sharpest ear heeds counsel. 1.102.2 People! Light your lamp from
the flame of one who gives counsel and heeds it, draw your water from a
spring that is unmuddied and pure.6 Servants of God! Do not rest on your
ignorance or follow your caprice for that camper encamps at «the lip of
a crumbling cliff».7 As he moves from place to place, as he innovates
one heresy then another, as he tries to glue two things that cannot
bond,asheworkstojointwothingsthatarefarapart,hecarrieshisdoomonhis back.
Fear God, and do not take your complaints to one who does not feel your
pain, who cannot undo with his makeshift ruling a mandated rule. A
leader's duties are those with which God has charged him: he must

five days after allegiance was pledged to him as caliph. ʿAlī ibn
Ibrāhīm al-Qummī, Tafsīr, 1:384. 2 Modified quote from Qurʾan, Aḥzāb
33:45.The Arabic begins with ḥattā ("until"), presumably
connectingfromanearliersectionontheconditionof
peoplejustbeforethecomingof Islam. 3 Ar. min baʿdihi: "until he came,"
addressing the early Muslims (H 7:119); or: "until he had gone,"
addressing the Umayyads (B 105). Or, if reading the text as min baʿdi
mā, as in some manu- scripts, the sentence would connect to the next
word and read as "You did not taste ... until after you had earlier
found the world to have a loose halter." 4 I.e., difficult to ride,

1: Orations 265 to good purpose, exert effort in giving advice, keep
alive the Sunnah, punish those who commit crimes, and distribute
treasury stipends fairly. People, has- ten to pluck knowledge before its
plant withers, seek to acquire knowledge from its keepers before
preoccupations distract, forbid evil and desist from it, for you have
been commanded to desist before forbidding others. 1.103 From an oration
by ʿAlī:1 1.103.1 Praise God who paved the path of Islam, made it smooth
for those who come to its waterholes, and protected its ramparts from
attackers. He made it a source of security for those who cling to it, a
place of safety for those who enter it, a proof for those who argue by
it, a witness for those who litigate with it, a light for those who seek
illumination by it, comprehension for those who understand, reason for
those who ponder, a sign for those who search for pasture,2 perception
for those who resolve to advance, a lesson for those who take heed,
salvation for those who believe, support for those who trust, com- fort
for those who submit, and a shield for those who endure. Islam's paths
are lit, its trails marked,3 its beacons high, its highway bright, its
lamps aglow, its arena honorable, its goal elevated, its racehorses
numerous, its prize sought, and its champions noble. Its path is faith,
its road good deeds, its end death, its racecourse the world, its track
the day of resurrection, and its prize par- adise. 1.103.2 From the same
oration in praise of the Prophet:4 1 Excerpt from an oration that ʿAlī
delivered in his home, either in Medina or Kufa, additional parts of
which are recorded as §1.69, and sayings §3.26 (about the four pillars
of belief) and §3.259 (ʿAbd al-Zahrāʾ, Maṣādir, 4:214--216). It is
related that ʿAlī was asked by an associate to describe belief (īmān),
and ʿAlī instructed him to come back the next day, so that others could
hear it too. He did return, presumably with others. ʿAlī then delivered
this oration and instructed that it be written down and read out to the
public (Kulaynī, Kāfī, 2:49). Kulaynī (ibid.) names the associate as
ʿAbdallāh ibn al-Kawwāʾ, while Ghazālī (Iḥyāʾ¸ 4:60) names him
asʿAmmāribnYāsir(if
so,theorationwouldhavebeendeliveredbeforeṢiffīn,in37/657,when ʿAmmār was
killed). Alternatively, §1.103.1 is also cited as an answer given during
an oration in the mosque in Basra, a few days after the Battle of the
Camel in 36/656 (Māmaṭīrī, Nuzhah, 224--225). Other parts of the same
oration in ibid., 221--233 are listed in note to §1.23. §1.103.1 is
similar to §1.154.2. 2 Or, for those who perceive hidden things
(tafarrasa). B 420; R 1:455; Ḥ7:122. 3 Or, its inner workings are clear.
B 420. 4 Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd (Ḥ7:174--175) remarks that none of the
Prophet's Companions praised the Prophet and prayed for him after his
death as passionately as ʿAlī did, just as no one aided and served the
Prophet during his lifetime as sincerely as ʿAlī and his family did.

on the road to paradise for those who had tied up their camels not
knowing where to go. He is the trustee whom you, God, entrusted with
your message, your witness on judgment day, your emissary sent as a
blessing, and your mes- senger dispatched with the truth as the
embodiment of mercy. God, bestow on him a bounteous share of your
justice, and reward him with a munificent recompense, multiplied
manifold by your generosity. God, let his palace tower high above all
others, provide him a noble place near you, honor his station at your
side, bestow him the right of intercession, grant him radiance and
excellence, and resurrect us in his company---let us not be people of
dishonor, remorse, deviation, violation, or error, or those who succumb
to sedition. Raḍī:This passage was narrated earlier.1 I have repeated it
here because the two reports vary in some of their language. 1.103.3
From the same oration addressing his associates: It is through God's
bounty that you have attained this high standing, in which your slave
girls are honored, and your neighbors receive gifts, where you are
revered by people to whom you have given no special favors or grants,
while others stand in your awe who have no reason to fear your attack
and over whom you have no command. Yet here you see God's compacts
broken and are not roused to anger, while when your ancestors'
traditions are rent, you profess outrage. God's affairs used to frequent
your waterhole, but you have relinquished your station to tyrants, and
entrusted your guide ropes to them. You have surrendered God's affairs
into their hands, as they implement their dubious actions and walk in
the path of their passions. But, by God, even if they strew you beneath
every distant star, God will reunite you, on an evil day for them. 1.104
From an oration ʿAlī delivered during one of the battle-days of Ṣiffīn:2
I saw you turn away from your battle lines and fall back, pushed away by
the rough rabble and common Bedouins of Syria, you, the aristocracy of
the Arabs, the summit of nobility, the bridge of its nose, and its lofty
hump! But my racing heart was calmed when later I saw you push them back
as they had pushed 1 §1.69. 2 Ṣiffīn, 37/657. At one point during the
battle, ʿAlī's right wing fell back. Ashtar, prompted by ʿAlī, addressed
them with a rousing oration, and they returned to fight and routed the
Syrians. ʿAlī then addressed them with the oration at hand. Ṭabarī,
