# Chapter 49: Orations 455 them and the wellspringsof her delightsflowed.
See howthe new religiongath- ered them within the gifts of its
grace.They were immersed in its bounty, joyful in the fresh greenness of
its way of life. Their affairs reposed comfortably in the shade of
powerful authority, events brought them under the aegis of vic- torious
might, and affairs looked kindly upon them, as they lived in ease in the
protection of an established empire. They became rulers of the world and
kings over the far reaches of the earth, controlling the affairs of
those who had controlled theirs, and issuing commands to those who had
commanded them. ⟨Their spear became hard, their rock uncrushable.⟩1
1.190.11 Hark! Your hands have loosed the rope of allegiance and
breached God's fortress by indulging in judgments from the Age of
Ignorance.This, when God has blessed this congregation by binding them
with bonds of affection, so they can move in its shade and take refuge
in its shelter! No one can fathom the value of this favor; it exceeds
any price and is grander than any eminence. Know this: After your
migration to Muḥammad's city, you have reverted to liv- ing as rough
Bedouins,2 after loyal unison, you have again split into factions. You
own nothing of Islam except its name, you recognize nothing of belief
except its ritual. You say, "Flames rather than shame!" as though you
wished to knock Islam over on its face, rending its holiness, and
breaking the covenant bywhich God
gaveyouasanctuaryuponhisearthandasourceof safetyamong the earth's
people. If you seek any other refuge, unbelievers will wage war against
you, and neither Gabriel nor Michael, neither Immigrants nor Allies,
will come to your aid.3 You will see only the clashing of swords until
God rules between you once and for all. You have witnessed examples of
God's might, of his blows, battle-days, and onslaughts. Do not ignore
his chastisement, under- estimate his assault, and undervalue his force,
do not think his retribution will be slow in coming! God damned the
generation just before you because they ceased to command good and
forbid evil. He damned the immature because they mounted the steeds of
sin and the mature because they ceased to forbid. 1 Arabic idioms. Lit.
⟨Their spear could never be squeezed (lā tughmaz), and their rock could
never be crushed (lā tuqraʿ)⟩. For references in poetry re "squeezing"
(ghamz) of a spear, see Ibn Manẓūr, Lisān, s.v. "Gh-M-Z." ⟨Their rock
cannot be crushed⟩(lā tuqraʿu lahum ṣafāh) is attributed to the Prophet
in Nuwayrī, Nihāyah, s.v. "Ṣ-F-W." 2 Re the migration (hijrah), I have
added the words "to Muḥammad's city" for clarity. Re Bedouins (aʿrāb),
the line signifies that "after having accepted the refinements of Islam,
you have reverted to the factional ways of pre-Islamic Arabians." B 768;
Ḥ13:18. Bedouins are chas- tised for hypocrisy in the Qurʾan, Tawbah
9:97, 99. 3 Gabriel and Michael are two archangels. Immigrants
(Muhājirūn) are those who migrated to Muḥammad in Medina, and Allies
(Anṣār) are the Medinans who supported him. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

457 Hark!Youhavecutoff Islam'srestrictions,strippedoff
itsconstraints,andkilled off its commands. Hark! God has commanded me to
fight those who commit treachery, break their pledge, and cause mayhem
on earth: I have fought those
whobroketheirpledge,battledthosewhoactedwrongfully,andsubduedthose who
left the faith.1 The Satan of the Stony Hollow was taken out by a
thunder- boltthatmadehisheartscreamandhisbreastquake.2Asmallnumberof
rebels remain: If God permits another attack, I shall most certainly
prevail, except for the handful that escape, who will scatter to the
corners of the realm. 1.190.12 It was I who felled the trunk of the
Arabs and crushed the horns of Rabīʿah and Muḍar.3 Besides, you all know
my relationship with God's Mes- senger, our close kinship and special
intimacy.4 He took me to his bosom as a newborn, clasping me to his
breast and covering me with his bedspread, his body touching mine and I
inhaling his fragrance; he would chew a piece of food to soften it then
place it in my mouth. He never found falseness in my words or foulnessin
myactions.Eversince theMessenger'sowninfancy,Godhadplaced his greatest
angel to guide him day and night on the path of virtue and the most
beautiful traits. I would follow him as a camel calf follows its mother,
and each dayhewouldraiseinfrontof

pledge-breakers (nākithūn) are said to be ʿAlī's opponents at the Battle
of the Camel, the wrongdoers (qāsiṭūn) are Muʿāwiyah and his Syrian
supporters, and those who left the faith (māriqūn) are the Kharijites,
the three groups that ʿAlī fought in the Battles of the Camel, Ṣiffīn,
and Nahrawān. Muḥammad's hadith, whose terminology ʿAlī echoes in his
oration, is reported as, ⟨You \[O ʿAlī\] will battle the
pledge-breakers, the wrongdoers, and the faith- leavers after me⟩.
Ḥ13:183--184; B 771--772; F 364--365. 2 The Satan of the Stony Hollow
(shayṭān al-rad'hah) is a man known as Dhū al-Thudayyah, "The Man with
the Breast," called thus because of a mass of flesh on his shoulder, a
Kharijite whose death at Nahrawān ʿAlī said the Prophet had told him
would signal his own immi- nent martyrdom. ʿAlī personally sought out
Dhū al-Thudayyah's corpse among the dead at Nahrawān, and when he saw
it, he exclaimed, "God is great! I have never lied, nor has \[the
Prophet\] lied to me." Ḥ13:183--184; B 771--772; F 364--365. 3 Refers to
ʿAlī's slaying of famous pre-Islamic Arabian warriors in single combat
during the early Muslims' battles, when he was only around twenty years
of age, thereby playing a major role in Islam's military and political
ascendancy. Muḍar is the eponymous ancestor of the Prophet's own tribe
of Meccan Quraysh, who formed the largest bloc of his enemies, and ʿAlī
slew several of their leaders in the Muslims' early battles. The Rabīʿah
tribe was divided among ʿAlī and his opponents during the Battles of the
Camel and Ṣiffīn, and ʿAlī slew several of their leaders who fought
against him then. B 772; Ḥ13:198. 4 Muḥammad had taken the infant ʿAlī
as his ward, and ʿAlī grew up in Muḥammad's care. Details in
Ḥ13:198--212; B 772--776. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera
