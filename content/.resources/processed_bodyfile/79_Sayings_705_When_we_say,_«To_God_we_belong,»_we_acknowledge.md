title: Sayings 705 When we say, «To God we belong,» we acknowledge
---
# Chapter 79: Sayings 705 When we say, «To God we belong,» we acknowledge
our subjugation.When we say, «To him we shall return,» we acknowledge
our mortality. 3.90 Lord, you know me better than I know myself, and I
know myself bet- ter than others know me. Lord, make me more virtuous
than they think, and forgive those of my actions they don't know.1 3.91
Your benefaction becomes perfect only when you add three more actions:
when you deem your favors small, they become great, when you conceal
them, they become clear, and when you expedite them, they are received
with joy. 3.92 An age is coming to the world in which none but the
schemer will be granted intimacy, none but the debauched will be
considered witty, and none but the just will be deemed weak. People will
regard charity a tax, gifts to rel- atives a favor, and God's worship a
means to self-glorification. At that time, power will be wielded through
the counsel of concubines, the command of boys, and the governance of
eunuchs. 3.93
ʿAlīwasseenwearingawornandpatchedgarment,andwhensomeoneremarked on this,
he explained: The heart bows to him and the soul prostrates before
him---true believers will follow my practice. 3.94 This world and the
hereafter are mutual enemies and divergent paths--- to love and follow
this world is to hate and reject the hereafter. The two are like East
and West for the person who walks between them---the nearer he draws to
one, the further he moves from the other. They are like two wives
married to one man. 3.95 Nawf al-Bikālī narrated this report, and he
said: I saw the Commander of the Faithful one night as he rose from his
bed, gazed at the stars, then said to me, "Nawf, are you asleep or
awake?" "I'm awake, Commander of the Faithful," I replied. ʿAlī then
said to me:2 1 Presumably in Kufa during ʿAlī's caliphate,
35--40/656--661. Response when he was praised to his face (Māmaṭīrī,
Nuzhah, 243--244). Similar final line in §1.191.3 (see note on context
there). 2 Presumably in Kufa during ʿAlī's caliphate, 35--40/656--661.
The words in parentheses within ʿAlī's text are Raḍī's explanatory
insertions. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -

707 Nawf, blessed are those who reject worldliness and focus their
desire on the hereafter! They take God's earth for a carpet, its dust
for a bed, its water for perfume, the Qurʾan as their garment, and
prayer as their robe. They cut their bonds with the world as the Messiah
did. Nawf, the Prophet David stepped out- side at just such an hour, and
said, ⟨This is an hour when the prayer of any who prays will be
answered, unless he is a tax collector, an appraiser, an enforcer, an
oud player (that is, a lute player), or a percussionist (that is, a
drummer).⟩ Raḍī: Alternatively, it is said that ʿarṭabah, the first word
of the last pair, means drum, and kūbah, the second word, means lute.
3.96 God has mandated certain things for you---don't squander them. He
has laid down certain limits for you---don't transgress them. He has
forbidden you certain actions---don't violate them. He has stayed silent
about certain things deliberately and not because he had
forgotten---don't burden yourself with them.1 3.97 When people forego a
religious duty to rally their worldly affairs, God opens for them a door
that leads to more harm. 3.98 A learned man is sometimes killed by
ignorance, and his learning fails to come to his aid.2 3.99 There is a
piece of flesh attached to the jugular vein that is the human's most
wondrous organ---the heart. It has elements of wisdom, and others that
are quite the opposite. If it is lifted by hope, ambition debases it,
and if ambi- tionboilsover,greeddestroysit,butif
disappointmenttakeshold,regretkillsit. If aggravated, its rage runs
rampant, but if made happy, it forgets to be circum- spect. If
overwhelmed by fear, caution preoccupies it, but if safety is secured,
heedlessness strips it away, and if calamity strikes, it panics. If it
gains prop- erty, wealth makes it a tyrant, but if poverty bites,
distress preoccupies it. If hunger enfeebles it, weakness prevents it
from rising, but if satiety is exces- sive, surfeit oppresses it. Every
deficiency does it harm, and every excess injures it.3 1 Hārūnī (Taysīr,
272) cites this excerpt as part of §1.50, an oration ʿAlī delivered in
Medina six days after he became caliph, in 35/656. 2 The line---which
refers to Ṭalḥah and Zubayr---is from ʿAlī's oration in Medina in
36/656, when news arrived that the two had set out for Basra with
ʿĀʾishah to raise an army against him. Ḥ1:233 (in commentary on §1.8),
after Abū Mikhnaf, Jamal. 3 From an aphoristic oration titled Wasīlah
(Ḥarrānī, Tuḥaf, 92--100). al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera

709 3.100 We are the saddle-pad in the middle---those who lag must catch
up, while those who exceed bounds must return to it.1 3.101 God's faith
is established only by a man who never blandishes, or suc- cumbs, or
follows the path of greed. 3.102 When Sahl ibn Ḥunayf, one of the people
ʿAlī loved dearly, died in Kufa soon after returning with him from
Ṣiffīn, he exclaimed:2 Were a mountain to love me, it would crumble!
Raḍī: The expression means that troubles bear down on such a man and
calamities rush to strike him, and that this happens only to pious
savants and virtuous saints. It resembles another saying by ʿAlī, in
which he said: Whoever loves us, the family of the Prophet, should
prepare to wear the robe of poverty. Raḍī:This saying has also been
interpreted differently, but this is not the place for those details.
3.103 There is no wealth more profitable than intelligence, no solitude
more desolate than vanity, no intelligence like prudent planning, no
honor like god- fearing piety, no companion like a beautiful character,
no legacy like mannered refinement, no leader like divine direction, no
trade like good deeds, no profit like heavenly reward, no restraint like
pausing when in doubt, no renunciation 1 "We" refers to the Prophet's
family according to all the commentators, but the enigmatic imageof the
"saddle-padinthemiddle"(al-numruqahal-wusṭā)isinterpretedvariouslyas:(1)
the true and just Imams, embodiment of the middle way between two
extremes, presumably those who deem ʿAlī the fourth caliph and those who
believe in his divinity; this explanation focuses on "in the middle,"
while "saddle-pad" is not explained (B 961; F 419); (2) the virtuous
mean between the vices, because the "saddle-pad" is placed higher than
everything else on the camel's back, and, being the place where the
rider sits, it is akin to a person's theologi- cal position (Ḥ18:273);
(3) the intermediate position of authority held by the family of the
Prophet, where the Prophet is the "greatest saddle-pad," and other
Muslim authorities are the "lesser saddle-pad" (R 3:302--303); (4)
comfort-givers, like the saddle-pad that supports and cushions the body
(ʿA 713). The text's context is also given variously as: (1) part of
ʿAlī's address to Ḥārith al-Hamdānī (ʿImād al-Dīn al-Ṭabarī, Bishārah,
21); (2) Part of a sermon in the mosque, presumably in Kufa; other parts
are §3.73, §3.81 (Māmaṭīrī, Nuzhah, 154--157, where the first line is,
"Follow the middle path," while the rest is the same as here); (3)
ʿAlī's address to a group from "the West" (presumably, Syria), in praise
of the truly pious (Yaʿqūbī, Tārīkh, 2:210). 2 In 37/657 or 38/658.

711 like renouncing the forbidden, no knowledge like contemplation, no
worship like the mandated rites, no faith like modesty and endurance, no
lineage like humility, no nobility like knowledge, and no support surer
than consultation.1 3.104 Among a people and at a time when integrity
prevails, you are being unjust if you entertain suspicions about a man
who has never performed an act of villainy. Among a people and at a time
when corruption prevails, you are rushing into peril if you trust any
man. 3.105 ʿAlī was asked, "How do you fare, Commander of the Faithful?"
and he replied:2 How fares he who is led to death by his life, carried
to sickness by his health, and about to be attacked in his place of
safety? 3.106 ʿAlī said: How many are made complacent by continued
favors, deceived by conceal- ment of sins, and duped by people's praise!
The most severe of God's tests is time and a slack rein. 3.107 Two kinds
of men are damned because of how they feel about me: one is excessive in
his love, the other is extreme in his hatred.3 3.108 Missed
opportunities produce regret. 3.109 This world is like a snake---soft to
the touch but filled with deadly poi- son. The foolish lad reaches out
for it, but the intelligent man is wary.4 3.110 ʿAlī was asked to
describe the clans of the Quraysh, and he said: Makhzūm are the sweet
blossoms of Quraysh, you enjoy the conversation of their men and delight
in marrying their women. ʿAbd Shams are the most far- sighted and the
most valiant in protecting their own. We, Hāshim, are the most
openhanded in giving and have the biggest hearts when facing death. They
are more numerous, more cunning, and more repugnant. We are more
eloquent, more sincere, and fairer of countenance. 1 Part of an oration
ʿAlī delivered nine days after Muḥammad's death, in Medina in 11/632
(Ṣadūq, Amālī, 399). Also included in Wasīlah (Ḥarrānī, Tuḥaf, 94). 2
The man who asked is ʿAlī's nephew ʿAbdallāh ibn Jaʿfar, who had come to
visit ʿAlī, who was ill. Ṭūsī, Amālī, 631. 3 Similar to §1.125,
addressed to the Kharijites in Kufa, 37/658. 4 Similar to §2.68, written
to Salmān al-Fārisī, who moved to Kufa in ʿUthmān's reign, and died in
Madāʾin in ca. 35/655. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera

3: Sayings 713 3.111 How different these two actions! An action whose
pleasure passes but whose punishment remains, and an action whose
suffering passes but whose reward remains. 3.112 ʿAlī was following a
bier in a funeral procession when he heard a man laugh. He exclaimed: We
behave as though death were decreed for everyone other than ourselves,
as though duties were incumbent upon everyone other than ourselves, as
if those who die before our eyes are travelers who will soon return! We
consign their bodies to the grave and consume their wealth, forgetting
every counselor and shrugging off every tragedy. Blessed is he whose
soul is humble, whose earnings are pure, whose heart is sincere, whose
character is good, who shares his sur- plus wealth, who restrains his
tongue from gratuitous utterances, who spares people his evil, who finds
sufficient room within the accepted practice, and to whom no heretical
innovation can be ascribed! Raḍī: Some people attribute these words to
God's Messenger.1 3.113 Woman's jealousy is heresy, man's jealousy is
faith.2 3.114 Ishalltracethepedigreeof
Islamasnoonehasdonebefore:Islammeans submission, submission means
certainty, certainty means belief, belief means acknowledgment,
acknowledgment means discharge of duties, and discharge of duties means
action.3 3.115 I am amazed by the miser who hastens to bring on himself
the very poverty he flees and fails to enjoy the very wealth he
seeks---he spends his life in this world among the destitute, yet is
held to account in the hereafter with the wealthy. I am amazed by the
conceited bighead who was but yesterday a droplet of sperm and who will
tomorrow be a rotting corpse. I am amazed by one who doubts God when he
can see God's creation. I am amazed by one who forgets death when he can
see the dead. I am amazed by one who denies the afterlife when he can
observe this life. I am amazed by one who furnishes the abode of
transience and ignores the abode of eternity. 1 Within an oration the
Prophet delivered "from the back of his camel" upon his return to Med-
ina from the Last Pilgrimage in 10/632. Yaʿqūbī, Tārīkh, 2:100; Kulaynī,
Kāfī, 8:168. 2 Islamic law allows a man to marry up to four co-wives,
while a woman may only marry one man at a time. B 966; R 3:315; F
421--422, citing Qurʾan, Nisāʾ 4:3. 3 "Submission" (taslīm) derives from
the same root ("S-L-M") as "Islam," whose lexical purview includes
submission, commitment, peace, and wellbeing. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

715 3.116 If you fall short in deeds, you will be afflicted with
anxiety. God has no need of someone who offers him no share of his life
or wealth. 3.117 Protect yourself against the cold when the wintry
weather begins, and expose yourself to it as it ends, for its action on
bodies is the same as its action on trees: the first cold burns, while
the last prompts leaves to sprout. 3.118 The majesty of the Creator in
your heart should make his creatures insignificant in your eyes.1 3.119
When ʿAlī reached the cemetery outside Kufa upon his return from Ṣiffīn,
he intoned:2 Opeopleof
desolateabodes,ruinedquarters,anddarktombs!Opeopleof dust, O people of
exile, O people of isolation, O people of desolation! You preceded us,
and we shall follow. As for your homes---others have occupied them. As
for your wives---others have bedded them. As for your
properties---others have divided them. This is our news---what is yours?
Then he turned to his companions and said: If they were permitted to
answer, they would say, «The best provision is piety.»3 3.120 ʿAlī
retorted to a man whom he overheard criticizing this world:4 1 From
ʿAlī's Hammām Oration describing the pious, §1.191.2. 2 According to
Ḥarrānī (Tuḥaf, 186--188), this is the second part of an oration ʿAlī
delivered late inthenightimmediatelyfollowingtheBattleof
theCamel,outsideBasrain36/656,toagroup of men from his own army, of
which the first part is recorded with some variants as §3.120 (the next
text here). Alternatively, the first line is recorded by Minqarī (Waqʿat
Ṣiffīn, 531) and Ṭabarī (Tārīkh, 5:61--62) as part of a longer address
ʿAlī intoned just outside Kufa in 37/657, on his return from Ṣiffīn,
when he saw the graves of his companion Khabbāb ibn al-Aratt and others;
he prayed for them (§3.37), then addressed them thus. The line could
have been used more than once by ʿAlī, and both contexts could be
correct. 3 Qurʾan, Baqarah 2:197. 4 Ḥarrānī (Tuḥaf, 186--188) says ʿAlī
delivered this oration late in the night outside Basra, imme- diately
following the Battle of the Camel in 36/656, to a group of men from
ʿAlī's own army, who were presumably blaming the world for the
inexplicable failings of Ṭalḥah, Zubayr, and ʿĀʾishah. ʿAlī reminds them
that the world is not responsible for the fate of its inhabitants. It is
followed in this source and some others by §3.119. Ibn al-ʿAsākir
(Tārīkh, 42:499) places this oration in the Grand Mosque in Kufa, in
response to a man whom ʿAlī heard chastising the world. Muwaffaq biʾllāh
(Iʿtibār, 51) narrates it from Aṣbagh ibn Nubātah, who says ʿAlī spoke
these words in response to a man who complained about the state of the
world. See further analysis of §3.119--200 in Qutbuddin, "ʿAlī's
Contemplations on this World and the Hereafter," 345--348. al-Sharīf
