# Chapter 74: Letters 657 that they would seize it from me, and I was
stunned when people rushed to So- and-So to pledge allegiance. I held
back my hand, I withheld my pledge, until I saw that large numbers had
apostatized from Islam and were calling for the eradication of
Muḥammad's religion. I feared then that if I did not show pub- lic
support for Islam and its people, I would see it breached or destroyed.
That calamity would be far greater than losing my right to rule, a rule
whose wares last for a few, short days, then cease to be, as a mirage
evaporates or as clouds disperse. I rose to confront those challenges
until falsehood ceased and disap- peared and religion became calm and
still. 2.62.2 From the same epistle: By God, if I were to face them
alone while their legions filled the length of the earth, I would still
not feel uneasy or afraid. I know that I am righteous, and my
certaintyisbequeathedbymyLord.IknowthattheystraywhileIwalkthepath of
guidance. I long to meet God, I anticipate and expect his beautiful
reward. What grieves me is the thought that this community could be
ruled by the rash
anddepravedwhotakewhatbelongstoGodastheirownproperty,treathisser- vants
like slaves, view the pious as enemies to be struck down and the wicked
as allies, whose numbers include men who drank prohibited drinks, who
were whipped under the aegis of Islam as punishment for their blatant
crime, as well as those who did not accept Islam until they were bought
for a paltry sum.1 If not, I would never go to the trouble to rouse,
reprehend, gather, or goad you, but would consign you to your refusal
and your tepid response. Do you not see that your borders shrink, your
cities are conquered, your territories are seized, and your lands are
attacked? March to fight your enemy, may God have mercy on you! Do not
sink to the earth in languor, else you acknowledge your shame and accept
dishonor, and your share will be the vilest and ugliest of all.The true
warrior is ever wakeful. If you sleep, be aware that your enemy does
not. Go in peace. 1 "Those who drank" refers to Walīd ibn ʿUqbah ibn Abī
Muʿīṭ, ʿUthmān's stepbrother and his
governorinKufa(Ḥ17:227--245---lengthynarrative,afterAbūal-Farajal-IsfahānīandIbnʿAbd
al-Barr; B 919; F 393), and/or al-Mughīrah ibn Shuʿbah (F 393 again; R
3:226--227). "Those who did not accept Islam until they were bought" by
gifts from the Prophet after the Conquest of Mecca, refers to Muʿāwiyah
and his father, Abū Sufyān (B 919), also several members of Muʿāwiyah's
Umayyad clan (Ḥ17:226), and/or ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ(F 393; R 3:227; B 919).

659 2.63 From ʿAlī's letter to Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, his governor in
Kufa. ʿAlī had sent word to the Kufans soliciting their support against
his opponents at the Battle of the Camel, and he learned that Abū Mūsā
was actively dissuading them:1 From God's servant, Commander of the
Faithful, to ʿAbdallāh ibn Qays. I am told that you have spoken words
that go both for you and against you. When my messenger arrives, roll up
your sleeves, gird your loins, emerge from your hideout, and urge your
townspeople to fight. If you are capable, get going. If
youareacoward,standdown.ByGod,youwillbeseizedwhereveryougoand pounded
until you are creamed and crushed,2 you will be thrown from your seat,
fearing what comes at you from the front and from behind. You are not
lookingatatrivialprotestherebutatagravecalamity---itscamelstallionsmust
be ridden, its restive beasts must be tamed, its threatening heights
must be lev- elled. Return to your senses, man, regain your command, and
take your due share and portion. Or, if you find this repugnant, then
step aside and leave, tak- ing with you neither greeting nor
safe-conduct---we are better off without you! Sleep on. No one will even
ask, "Where is So-and-So?"We are righteous, by God, and on the path of
right. We care nothing for what the heretics do. Go in peace. 2.64 From
ʿAlī's reply to Muʿāwiyah:3 Yes, my clan and yours were on terms of
affection and unity, as you say, but what divided us yesterday was our
belief and your unbelief, and what divides us today is our right and
your wrong. Those of you who accepted Islam did so only because they
were forced to, after the foremost Arabians had joined God's Messenger
and formed the vanguard of Islam.4 You claim that I killed Ṭalḥah and
Zubayr, threatened ʿĀʾishah, and set up a military base between the two
1 FromhiscampinDhūQārtoKufain36/656,inthelead-uptotheBattleof
theCamel,address- ing Abū Mūsā by his given name and patronymic,
ʿAbdallāh ibn Qays. In response to ʿAlī's earlier message instructing
him to recruit, Abū Mūsā had given a speech in which, though
acknowledging ʿAlī's caliphate, he cautioned the Kufans against
answering ʿAlī's call to fight; he said he had heard the Prophet say
there would come a time when it was better to sit back than to fight,
and this was that time, because it was not permitted to Muslims to fight
their fellow Muslims. ʿAlī sent his letter with his son Ḥasan to Abū
Mūsā in Kufa. Ḥasan dismissed Abū Mūsā from his post and recruited the
Kufans to join ʿAlī. B 920; Ḥ17:246. 2 Lit. "... until your cream mixes
with your whey, your liquids with your solids." 3 Presumably sent from
Kufa to Damascus in 37/657, in the lead-up to the Battle of Ṣiffīn
(contains lines similar to §2.10). See Muʿāwiyah's letter that prompted
ʿAlī's response in Ḥ 17:251--256. 4 After having fought the Muslims in
the early years, Muʿāwiyah's father, Abū Sufyān, and most of his clan
accepted Islam only after the Conquest of Mecca, when a large part of
the Arabian Peninsula had come under Muḥammad's control. Abū Sufyān's
story in R 3:231--232; B 922. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera
