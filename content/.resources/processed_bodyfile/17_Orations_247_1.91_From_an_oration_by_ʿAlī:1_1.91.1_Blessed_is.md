# Chapter 17: Orations 247 1.91 From an oration by ʿAlī:1 1.91.1 Blessed is
God! Vaunting aspirations cannot attain him, swift intellects cannot
find him, he has no limit and will not expire, he has no boundary and
will not cease to be. 1.91.2 From the same oration: God placed them in
the finest depository and the choicest repository. Patri- cian loins
conveyed them to chaste wombs. Each time a forebear passed, his
successor stood up to establish God's religion, until this divine honor
came to Muḥammad. God extracted him from the most precious of mines to
be quar- ried, the most venerated of roots from which to grow, from the
very same tree from which God brought forth his prophets and chose his
trustees. Muḥam- mad's line is the best line, his family is the best
family, his tree is the best tree. Rooted in the sacred enclave, it
rises high in its fertile soil, with tall branches and matchless fruits.
Muḥammad is the leader of the pious and a source of sight for those who
follow the path, a shining lamp, a blazing star, and a spark- ing flint.
His way is the middle way, his practice gives direction, his words are
final, and his judgment is the embodiment of justice. God sent Muḥammad
after a period had passed without prophets, when people had stopped
doing good, and nations' minds had dulled. 1.91.3
Dogood---MayGodhavemercyonyou!---andfollowitsclearwaymarks, for its road
is wide and leads to the Abode of Safety. Beware, for you live in the
abode of those who have been warned, where you have been given a brief
respite and a little time. Registers are still open, pens still run with
ink, bodies are still healthy, tongues are still unfettered, repentance
is still received, and deeds are still accepted. 1.92 From an oration by
ʿAlī: At the time when God sent Muḥammad as a prophet, people wandered
in confusion and attempted to gather their firewood in the darkness of
sedition.
Passionshadseducedthem,arrogancehadcausedthemtoslip,grossignorance had
rendered them witless, and they stood confounded in the face of tumul-
tuous affairs and painful folly. Muḥammad did his utmost to offer them
sincere advice. He trod the true path and called to «wisdom and
counsel.»2 1 Excerpt from a famous long oration that ʿAlī delivered in
Kufa after the arbitration in 37/658, urging his followers to regroup
and fight Muʿāwiyah (Ṣadūq, Tawḥīd, 41, 72). Iskāfī (Miʿyār, 255) says
it is part of the Luminous Oration (Zahrāʾ), which also includes §1.106
and §1.158. 2 Qurʾan, Naḥl 16:125. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and
