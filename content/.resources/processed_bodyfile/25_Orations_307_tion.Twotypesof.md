that evil banner,evenif
thatmanwereme,themanwearingthisturban!Thearbitrators' charge was to
revive what revives the Qurʾan and to kill what kills the Qurʾan. To
revive the Qurʾan is to unite around it, and to kill it is to splinter
from it. The mandate was that if the Qurʾan drew us to them, we would
follow them, and if it drew them to us, they would follow us. I have
committed no wrong--- may you have no fathers! I did not deceive you or
muddy your affair. It was you, the majority of you, who chose these two
men. I made them pledge that they would not transgress the Qurʾan, but
they strayed from it and abandoned the truth, while seeing it all the
while in front of them. Their intent was to oppress, and they did. I had
made their arbitration contingent upon justice and truth--- by their
corrupt judgment and unjust ruling they have invalidated it. 1.126 From
an address by ʿAlī foretelling epic fighting in Basra:3 Listen, Aḥnaf! I
see him marching with troops that raise no dust, that make no sound,
with no clanking of irons or neighing of horses, their feet silently
pounding the earth like swift ostriches. Raḍī: In these lines, ʿAlī
predicted the uprising of the Chief of the Zanj.4 Then he said: Grief to
your flourishing quarters and beautiful homes, with their eagle wings
and elephant trunks,5 from an army whose dead will go unmourned and
whose missing will go unnoticed! As for me, I hurl the world on its
face, I measure it for what it is worth, I view it with its own eyes! 1

see Ḥ8:119--122; Asatryan, Controversies in Formative Shiʿi Islam; Halm,

taken to mean the Umayyads and the Kharijites, see Husayn, Opposing the

309 From the same address, foretelling the coming of the Turks:1 I see
them before me now, their craggy faces latticed shields, their robes
silk and brocade, their mounts purebred steeds. I see violent fighting,
the wounded trampling the slain, hardly any escaping and a host being
captured. At that, one of ʿAlī's associates exclaimed, "You have
knowledge of the mysteries, Com- mander of the Faithful!" ʿAlī laughed
and said to the man, who was from the tribe of Kalb: This is not
knowledge of the mysteries, O Kalbite, but what I have learned from one
who had true knowledge.2 Knowledge of the mysteries constitutes know-
ing the coming hour and the things God has enumerated in his words, «God
has knowledge of the coming hour, he sends down rain, and knows what is
in wombs. No man knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no man knows the
land in which he will die, but God is all-knowing, all-aware.»3 God
knows what is in wombs, male or female, ugly or beautiful, generous or
stingy, wretched or blissful. He knows who will go to hell and who will
enjoy the company of the prophets in paradise. This is the knowledge of
mysteries that God alone pos- sesses. All else is knowledge that God
taught to his Prophet, who taught it to me, and he prayed for my heart
to preserve it and my breast to keep it safe. 1.127 From an oration by
ʿAlī about measures and weights:4 Servantsof
God!You,withallthatyoudesireof thisworld,arelodgerswithfixed timespans
and debtors whose reckoning is coming due. The term approaches and deeds
are preserved. Some who strive still squander and some who work still
lose. You live in an era when good retreats, evil advances, and Satan is
greedy for people he can throw into hell. This is that time: his army is
strong, his plots commonplace, and his victims easy prey. Look at the
people, look where you like! All you will see is paupers who suffer,
rich men who repay God's blessings with ingratitude, misers who withhold
God's due, and rebels whose ears are deaf to counsel. Where are the
virtuous and the pious, where are the free and the generous, where are
the honest earners and the people of scru- 1 The commentators explain
this prophecy as foretelling the Mongol attack on the Muslim heartlands
in the 7th/13th century initially under Chingiz Khan and culminating in
the sack of Baghdad under Chingiz's grandson Hülegü in 656/1258. For
details, see Ḥ8:218--243; Jack- son, "Hülegü b. Toluy b. Chinggis
Khān,"ei3; Biran, "Chinggis Khān,"ei3; Morgan, "Mongols," ei2. 2 The
reference is to the Prophet Muḥammad. 3 Qurʾan, Luqmān 31:34. 4 Although
this text does not mention measures or weights, presumably ʿAlī is
condemning his addressees for marketplace cheating. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

1: Orations 311 ple? They have departed this vicious, murky world,
leaving you insignificant scum, you, whose very censure lips disdain to
utter, whose slightest mention they spurn! «Truly, to God we belong, and
to him we return!»1 Corruption is everywhere, but no one condemns or
changes it, no one censures or disap- proves. Is this how you earn
lodging in God's sacred abode and seek to become his dearest friends?
Perish the thought! God cannot be tricked into giving you paradise, his
pleasure is earned only by obedience. God's curse on those who command
good yet don't perform, who forbid evil yet don't renounce! 1.128 From
an address by ʿAlī to Abū Dharr when he was exiled to Rabadhah:2 Abū
Dharr, you were roused to anger in God's cause, so place your trust in
the one in whose cause you were roused to anger. Your adversaries fear
you with regard to their worldly gain, while you fear them because of
your pious beliefs. Leave in their hands the thing they fear you will
seize, and flee from them, tak- ing with you the thing you fear they
will take. How desperately they need the thing you forbid them, and how
little you need the thing they forbid you! They will learn on the morrow
who has the most profit, who is the most envied. Even if skies and earth
close in on a true servant of God, God will show him a way to escape, if
he remains conscious of him. Let truth be your comfort, and don't be
afraidof anythingexceptkeepingcompanywithfalsehood.If youhadaccepted
their proposals for worldly gain, they would have been on your side. If
you had partaken of their offers, they would have offered you full
protection. 1.129 From an address by ʿAlī:3 You divided souls and
fragmented hearts, present in body but absent in mind! I urge you toward
truth, but you bolt from it like goats from a lion's snarl! How
impossible a task to brighten through your help this night of obscured
justice,4 1 Qurʾan, Baqarah 2:156. 2
ʿAlīdeliveredthisaddresstoAbūDharral-Ghifārīontheoutskirtsof
Medina;itwasreportedly committed to memory by Dhakwān, freedman of
ʿAlī's sister Umm Hānī, who was present. I have not located the date in
the sources, but it is presumably shortly before 32/652, which is when
Abū Dharr died. Abū Dharr was one of Muḥammad's prominent and pious
compan- ions and an early convert to Islam. ʿUthmān exiled him to
Rabadhah, two hundred kilometers northeast of Medina, because he was an
outspoken supporter of ʿAlī and openly condemned the Umayyads, and he
died there. For details, see Ḥ8:252--262; B 473--474; Afsaruddin, "Abū
Dharr al-Ghifārī,"ei3. 3 Part of an oration ʿAlī delivered during his
caliphate on the pulpit of Kufa (Sibṭ, Tadhkirah, 120), presumably,
based on the opening line, after the arbitration in 37/658, when he was
urg- ing his supporters to regroup to fight Muʿāwiyah. 4 Ar. sirār
al-ʿadl; the commentators give different explanations for sirār: (1) the
last (moonless) night of the month (R 2:51; Ḥ8:264); (2) a concealed
thing (B 475); (3) shining lines on some- one's forehead (Ḥ8:264). They
agree on the general meaning of the phrase that contains the word.

313 or to straighten out the distorted truth! God!You know my intent was
not to vie for power or seek this world's fleeting possessions. I did
what I did in order to restore the waymarks of your religion and reform
your lands, so your oppressed
servantswouldfindsecurityandyourforsakenmandatesbeoncemoreupheld. God! I
am the first who turned to you, who heard and answered your call. No one
except your Messenger preceded me in the prayer of Islam. O people, you
know that one who is in charge of marriage contracts, penalties for
murder, dis- tribution of war gains, legal rulings, and leadership of
the Muslims should not be a miser or his greed would target their
property, he should not be ignorant or he would lead them astray, he
should not be harsh or he would alienate them, he should not be a tyrant
or he would favor one group over another, he should not be corrupt or he
would squander rights and be unjust in the distribution of stipends, and
he should not be a person who obstructs the Sunnah or the community
would perish. 1.130 From an oration by ʿAlī: 1.130.1
IgivepraisetoGodforwhathehastakenawayandwhathehasgranted, for what he
has gifted to us and what he has tested us with. He is aware of all that
is hidden and present with all that is concealed, he knows all that
hearts cover and all that eyes disclose. Thus, with my thoughts the same
as my dec- laration, and my heart in accord with my tongue, I testify
that there is no god other than he, and that Muḥammad is his chosen
messenger. 1.130.2 From this same oration: By God, it is seriousness, no
jest, all truth, no lies---there is nothing before you but death. Its
caller has made its voice heard, and its driver has quickened the
caravan, so don't let the recklessness of the masses distract you from
your soul. You have seen the people who went before who amassed wealth
and dreaded destitution, who were complacent about retribution because
they cherished long hopes and ignored their shrinking lifespans. You saw
death alight at each one's door, shove him out of his homeland, and
seize him from his place of safety. He was carried out on fate's wooden
planks, one group of men handing him on to another, transporting him on
their shoulders and gripping him by
theirfingers.Haveyounotseenthosewhocherishedlonghopes,raisededifices
with strong mortar, and amassed abundant wealth? Their houses have
become
graves,whattheygatheredisinruin,theirpropertyhasgonetotheirheirs,their
wives to other men. They are no longer asked to do good or to repent of
earlier sins. It is those who robe their hearts in piety, who outrace
their peers, whose deeds win the day. Work hard for this. Perform the
deeds required to win par- al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera

315 adise. This world has not been created for you as a home, it has
been created for you as a passage on which to gather provisions for the
final residence. Make haste to leave it. Make ready the backs of your
camels for the journey. 1.131 From an oration by ʿAlī: 1.131.1 This
world and the hereafter have submitted their reins to God, the skies and
the earth have handed him their keys, and the blossoming trees pros-
trate to him at dawn and at dusk. From their branches, his luminous
flames are kindled, and in response to his words, they bring forth their
harvest of fruit.1 1.131.2 From the same oration: The Book of God is in
front of you. It is a speaker whose tongue does not stutter, a house
whose pillars do not collapse, and a force whose supporters are never
crushed. 1.131.3 From the same oration: God sent Muḥammad---when
prophecy had lagged, and tongues fiercely quar- reled---to follow his
messengers and seal his revelation. Muḥammad fought in God's path
against those who had turned away from him or who assigned him peers.
1.131.4 From the same oration: The blind see only this world.They cannot
see past it, whereas the sighted pen- etrate it to see what is beyond,
and they know their home is yonder.The sighted are waiting to leave it,
whereas the blind are moving toward it. The sighted gather provisions
from it, whereas the blind gather provisions for it. 1.131.5 From the
same oration:2 Know this: there is almost nothing its possessor doesn't
weary of except life--- no one ever takes comfort in death. This
knowledge is the wisdom that brings life to the dead heart, sight to the
blind eye, sound to the deaf ear, and water to the parched throat.3 It
gives you all the counsel you need, and total safety. 1 References in
this section are to Qurʾan, Ḥajj 22:18, Yāsīn 36:80, Baqarah 2:265. 2
The next three paragraphs are thematically unconnected excerpts from

317 By God's Book you see and perceive, through it you speak with
reason, and from it you hear the truth. One part of the Qurʾan supports
the other---it con- tains no contradictions about God, and never leads
its reader away from him. Although you hate one another, you band
together to cultivate the refuse dump of malice, clasping hands for
worldly gain, while fighting one another in the pursuit of wealth.
Surely, the evil one has caught you in his spell and arro- gance has led
you astray! I seek God's help to fight my passions and yours. 1.132 From
an address by ʿAlī responding to ʿUmar's request for advice on whether
he should lead the expedition against the Byzantines:1 God has
guaranteed to followers of this faith that he will protect their land
and guard their honor. He was the one who gave victory to their small
band when they struggled to gain the upper hand, and he protected them
when they could not protect themselves. He is the everliving who never
dies. When you lead the expedition against the enemy, if you engage them
and are pushed back, our fighters will have no stronghold to give them
refuge and will flee to dis- tant lands. If you are gone, they will have
no community to which to return. Instead, dispatch a seasoned fighter
accompanied by an experienced and intel- ligent group of warriors. If
God grants them victory, then you have achieved your goal. If the
outcome is otherwise, then you will still be here to harbor our people
and provide a haven to which our warriors can return. 1.133 From an
address by ʿAlī. ʿAlī and ʿUthmān exchanged words, whereupon al-
Mughīrahibnal-AkhnassaidtoʿUthmān,"Iwilltakecareof
himforyou."ʿAlīthundered at Mughīrah:2 You son of a barren, cursed
father, of a tree without root or branch, you will see to me? By God, no
man you support will ever obtain God's aid, no man you prop up will
remain standing! Be gone, may God starve you of rain, and do your worst!
And if you do, may God see to you! 1 In Medina, in 15/636, just before
ʿUmar, the second Sunni caliph, participated in the march to Palestine.
For details of this episode and the conquest of Syro-Palestine see
Ḥ8:298--300; B 481; Ṭabarī, Tārīkh, 3:608. Similar context and language
in §1.144, re ʿUmar's march against the Persians. 2 The incident took
place in Medina soon after Abū Dharr's death in exile in Rabadhah in
32/652,whenʿUthmānresolvedtoalsosendʿAmmārintoexile.ʿAlīobjected,andMughīrah---
a close associate of ʿUthmān's who would be killed alongside him---came,
along with Zayd ibn Thābit, as ʿUthmān's emissary, to remonstrate with
and threaten ʿAlī (Ibn Aʿtham, Futūḥ, 2:380). Al-Mughīrah ibn
al-Akhnas---whose brother, Abū al-Ḥakam, ʿAlī had killed at the Bat- tle
of Uḥud (details in Ḥ8:301--303)---was ʿAlī's keen enemy. On
disagreements between ʿAlī and ʿUthmān during the latter's caliphate,
see Ḥ9:3--30. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -

1: Orations 319 1.134 From an address by ʿAlī:1 Your oath of allegiance
to me was not sworn on an impulse,2 and, furthermore, our intentions are
not the same: I pursue you for the sake of God, while you pursue me for
your own ends. People, help me to make you better! By God, I shall bring
justice to the oppressed! I shall drag the oppressor by his nose-ring
until I bring him kicking and screaming to the waterhole of truth! 1.135
From an address by ʿAlī regarding Ṭalḥah and Zubayr:3 1.135.1
ByGod,theyhavenocausetofaultme,noristhedisputetheyraiseafair one. They
demand from me a right they abandoned and vengeance for blood they
spilt. If I had been their partner in this affair, they would still have
their share of culpability. But if they have undertaken it on their
own---which they have---then they should be the target of vengeance, and
the first justice they mete out should be
againstthemselves.Butmyconvictionhas notdesertedme,
andIhaveneverdeceivednorbeendeceived!Theyarethetreacherousfaction!4
Their insides are filled with dark slime, scorpion venom, and black
suspicions.5 But the truth has become clear. Falsehood's grinding mill
has been pushed out of its pivot, and its tongue has been curbed from
inciting evil. By God, I shall fill the waterhole for them as only I
can---they shall neither leave it sated nor ever drink again from a
smooth-bottomed pond! 1.135.2 From the same address:6 1 From ʿAlī's
oration in Medina, soon after his accession to the caliphate in 35/656,
referring to ʿAbdallāh ibn ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, Saʿd ibn Abī Waqqāṣ,
Muḥammad ibn Maslamah, Ḥas- sān ibn Thābit, and Usāmah ibn Zayd, who
refused to pledge allegiance to him and decided to sit out the ongoing
conflict. Mufīd, Irshād, 1:243, which also includes earlier lines from
this oration. 2 Refers to ʿUmar's statement, "The oath of allegiance to
Abū Bakr was driven by an impulse ( faltah), but God protected the
community from its evil. Whoever repeats such an action must be killed"
(Ḥ9:31; B 482), narrated widely in both Shiʿi and Sunni sources. 3 From
ʿAlī's oration in Dhū Qār just before he left for Basra to fight his
challengers at the Battle of the Camel, in 36/656 (Mufīd, Irshād,
1:251). See similar lines in §1.10 and §1.22. 4 The commentators state
that the definite article "al-" in al-fiʾah al-bāghiyah (the treacherous
faction) indicates ʿAlī's prior knowledge of this group based on a
portent from the Prophet. B 483; Ḥ9:37. 5 "Dark slime" (ḥamaʾ) is a
metaphor for deceit and corruption (B 483); some say it refers to the
Qurʾanic verse in Ḥijr 15:26, which says humans were made from ḥamaʾ
(Ḥ9:34). The variant
reading"relative"(ḥamā)isareferencetoZubayr,whowasthesonof
Muḥammad's,andʿAlī's, paternal aunt (ibid.). 6 Refers to the Muslims in
Medina---including Ṭalḥah and Zubayr---who rushed to ʿAlī after
ʿUthmān's death, insisting that he accept their oath of allegiance
(bayʿah). First lines are sim- ilar to §1.3.4 (Shiqshiqiyyah), §1.53,
§1.226. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -
