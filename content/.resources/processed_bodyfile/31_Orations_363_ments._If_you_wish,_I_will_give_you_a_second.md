---
# Chapter 31: Orations 363 ments. If you wish, I will give you a second
example, that of Moses, he to whom God spoke. Moses beseeched, «My Lord,
I am in dire need of whatever you may bestow!»1 By God, Moses asked God
for nothing more than a piece of bread, for he had only wild plants to
eat. He was so thin, his flesh so pared, that the green of the plants he
had eaten shone through the translucent skin of his stomach. If you
wish, I will give you a third example, that of David, he with the
Psalms, reciter for the people of paradise. David would plait palm
fronds with his own two hands and say to his associates, "Who will sell
these for me?" then he would eat a coarse loaf of barley purchased with
its sale. And if you wish, I will also tell you about Jesus, son of
Mary. Jesus would use a rock for a pillow and wear rough garments. His
food was hunger, his lamp at night the moon, his shelter in the winter
the sun's rays from East and West, his fruit and his fragrance the
plants grown by the earth for the beasts. He had no wife to distract
him, no son to grieve him, no wealth to occupy him, no greed to bring
him low. His mount was his own two feet, his servant his own two hands.
1.158.4 People,followtheexampleof yourownvirtuousandpureProphet.Any who
look for an exemplar can find one in him. Any who look for consolation
can find it in him. Of all his servants, God loves most the one who
follows the example of his Prophet, who walks in his footsteps.The
Prophet took the small- est morsel from the world, he never gave the
world a full glance. His waist was the most emaciated, his stomach the
emptiest of worldly things.The world was offered to him, but he refused.
He knew that God hated it, so he hated it too. He knew that God
considered it wretched, so he considered it wretched too. He knew that
God considered it of little worth, so he considered it of little worth
too. People, if our only faults are love for what God hates and
exaltation of what he considers paltry, they would be sufficient to
count as opposition to God and challenge to his command! The Prophet
used to eat on the ground and sit like a servant. He used to mend his
sandals with his own hands. He used to patch his garments with his own
hands. He used to ride an unsaddled donkey, not even alone, but with
someone often sitting behind him. A curtain with images was hung on the
door of his home, and he said to one of his wives, ⟨Remove it from my
sight---it reminds me of the world and its ornaments!⟩He turned his
heart away from the world, he suppressed its mention in his heart, he
pre- ferred that its adornments be removed from his eyes, so that he
would not to be seduced by its soft luxuries or led to view it as a
lasting home or permanent residence. He drove it from his spirit,
banished it from his heart, and removed it 1 Qurʾan, Qaṣaṣ28:24.

365 fromhissight;forthosewhohateathinghatetolookatit,andtheyhatetohave
it mentioned. The Messenger's story teaches you about the evils of the
world and its flaws. He faced hunger and his loved ones did too. Its
ornaments were kept from him despite his closeness to God. Let the
discerning mind think: Did God honor Muḥammad by this or demean him? If
he answers, "God demeaned him," then, by God, he lies! If he answers,
"God honored him," then that per- son should know that God, in fact,
demeaned others to whom he gave worldly
chattels,whileturningthemawayfromtheoneclosesttohim.Anywhoseekan
exemplar should follow God's Prophet, walk in his footsteps, and enter
through his door, else he will face perdition. God has made Muḥammad the
banner for the coming hour, the herald of paradise, the warner ahead of
the decisive pun- ishment. Leaving the world empty-bellied, he entered
the hereafter in sound health. Never once did he build a grand house, or
place stone upon stone, until at last he answered his Lord's call and
went on to his final abode. What a great favor God has granted us,
having blessed us with Muḥammad as an exemplar to follow, a commander in
whose footsteps to walk. By God, I too have patched my rough cloak so
often that I am embarrassed to have it mended. Someone said to me, "Why
don't you throw it away?" and I replied, "Get away from me! ⟨When
morning comes, the night-traveler will be praised!⟩"1 1.159 From an
oration by ʿAlī: God sent Muḥammad with brilliant light, clear proof, a
distinct path, and a book of guidance. His family is the best family,
his tree is the best tree, its branches straight and tall, its fruits
hanging low. His birth was in Mecca, his migration was to Ṭaybah,2 from
there his fame rose high, and his voice spread far and wide. God sent
Muḥammad with ample evidence, healing counsel, and an enlivening faith,3
through him, he revived abandoned laws,4 crushed newfangled heresies,
and explained decreed rules. Indeed, «whoever seeks a religion other
than Islam»5 will find his wretchedness real, his support bro- 1 A line
of rajaz by the pre-Islamic poet Jumayḥibn al-Sharīd al-Taghlibī, used
proverbially to mean that fortitude begets a praiseworthy result. F 270;
Abū Hilāl, Jamharah, 2:32, 2:42; Bakrī, Faṣl al-maqāl, 254, 334;
Maydānī, 2:3, §2382; Jāḥiẓ, Ḥayawān, 6:508. 2 Earlier Yathrib,
Ṭaybah---"The Pure (City)"---is the name given by Muḥammad to his new
hometown. After Muḥammad's migration, people began referring to it as
"The City of the Prophet" (Madīnat al-nabī) in short, Medina, which is
how it is best known. 3 Ar. daʿwah, lit. call. 4 Ar. sharāʾiʿ sing.,
sharīʿah, lit. paths, potentially referring to the laws of earlier
prophets. 5 Qurʾan, Āl ʿImrān 3:85. The verse may also be translated,
«... other than commitment (islām) to God's will». al-Sharīf al-Raḍī

367 ken, and his tread unsteady. His final return will be to
long-lasting grief and
painfulpunishment.IplacemytrustinGodandturntohim.Iseekhisguidance in
finding the path that will lead to his Garden and direct me to his
pleasure. Servants of God! I counsel you to be conscious of him and obey
him, for that will bring you salvation on the morrow and eternal
deliverance. He cautioned you to beware and gave full warning. He
directed you to earn reward and gave complete measure. He described the
world to you and told you of its severance, its transience, its
departure. People, turn away from everything in it that excite your
wonder, because it will not be with you for long.This world is the
domicile that is closest to God's anger and farthest from his pleasure.
Servants of God, be certain of its separation and mutability, turn your
eyes away from its griefs and occupations, be true to your soul and work
hard for it, fear the world's dealings, and learn from the generations
before you that you have seen die. Their limbs fell asunder, their ears
and eyes ceased to function, their grandeur and might were lost, their
happiness and joys were severed. In place of proximity to their children
they were given loss, in place of the companionship of spouses they were
given isolation. They no longer boast, or procreate, or visit, or
associate. Servants of God, beware! Control your passions, restrain your
desires, and use your intellect! The matter is clear, the banner is
erect, the road is compact, and the path is straightforward. 1.160 From
an address by ʿAlī, to one of his associates who asked him, "How is it
that your tribe has driven you away from this position when you are
worthier?" ʿAlī answered:1 You man of Asad! Your girth is loose, and you
fire without aim!2 Still, you possess kinship through marriage, and have
the right to ask.3 You want to know, so I will give you an answer: The
injustice done to us concerning this position---when we are loftier in
lineage and our kinship with the Messenger is closer---was an act of
amoral appropriation. Some hearts coveted it, other 1 Ṣadūq (Amālī,
716--717) places this address at Ṣiffīn in 37/657; the speaker is a man
from the Dūdān clan of Asad. "This position" (hādhā l-maqām), refers to
the caliphate; Sunni com- mentators (Ḥ2:243; also mentioned in B 543)
interpret the referent as the Shūrā Council who elected ʿUthmān, while
Shiʿi commentators (B 543; R 2:125) interpret the referent as ʿUthmān in
particular, but also Abū Bakr and ʿUmar. 2 Refers to the man's lack of
discernment and his speaking out of turn. R 2:122; Ḥ9:242; B 543; F 271.
3 ʿAlī's kinship to the Asad tribe was through one of the following
Asadī women: (1) ʿAlī's wife Laylā bint Masʿūd ibn Khālid (F 271--272);
(2) an unnamed wife of ʿAlī (R 2:123); (3) the Prophet's wife Zaynab
bint Jaḥsh (Ḥ9:242--243; Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd says ʿAlī himself never mar-
ried into Asad). al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -
