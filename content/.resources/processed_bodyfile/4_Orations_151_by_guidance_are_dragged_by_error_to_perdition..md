# Chapter 4: Orations 151 by guidance are dragged by error to perdition.
Hark my words! You have been commanded to journey and directed to
provision. What I fear most for you is the pursuit of desire and lengthy
yearnings. Take provisions in this world, from this world, to nourish
your souls tomorrow. Raḍī: If ever words grabbed you by the neck and
compelled you to renounce the world and perform deeds for the hereafter,
it would be these words, which cut the cords of false hope and ignite
the flint of counsel and warning. Among their most wondrous lines are,
"Today is the day of training and tomorrow the race: its goal is
paradise, or its end hellfire." For in addition to majestic vocabulary,
exalted themes, clear analogies, and effective metaphors, they enfold a
wondrous secret and sublime significance in the line, "its goal (subqah)
is paradise, or its end (ghāyah) hellfire." Here, ʿAlī differentiates
between the two words because they have different significations. He
does not say "its goal is hellfire" as he says "its goal is paradise"
because one races towards something one wants, to a prize one hopes to
win, and that is the description of paradise. But this significance does
not apply to hellfire---may God protect us from it!---so it would be
impermissible to say, "its goal is hellfire." Rather, ʿAlī says, "its
end is hellfire," because an end is reached by those who are not pleased
to reach it as well as by those who are pleased to reach it; it conveys
both situations. In the context of this sermon, the word "end" indicates
the last stop, the place of final return, as in God's words, «Say:Take
plea- sure if you wish! Your last stop is hellfire.»1 It would be
impermissible to say here, "your goal is hellfire." Reflect on ʿAlī's
words, for the signification of this saying is wondrous, its well deep.
And this is true for the entirety of ʿAlī's speech. 1.29 From an oration
by ʿAlī:2 People! You are together in body but divided in aspiration.
Your words would shatter mighty rocks, but your actions embolden the
enemy. In your gather- ings you say this and that, but when battle
approaches, you yell, "Be gone! Get away!" A mission that depends on you
never succeeds. A heart that is subjected to you is never at ease.
Excuses and falsehoods! You keep asking for a delay, like debtors who
put off and refuse to pay! Men without honor cannot fight injus-
tice.Rightscannotbewonexceptthroughearnesteffort.Tellme---whichhome will
you defend when this one is taken? Under which leader will you fight
when I am gone? By God, whoever believes in you is deluded! Whoever wins
you as his share wins the losing arrow! Whoever has you in his bow
shoots a broken- 1 Qurʾan, Ibrāhīm 14:30. 2 ʿAlī delivered this oration
in Kufa, following a raid by Muʿāwiyah's commander al-Ḍaḥḥāk ibn Qays
al-Fihrī in 39/660 on pilgrims encamped at Thaʿlabiyyah. Ḥ2:113--117, B
225. Nuʿmān (Daʿāʾim, 1:391) identifies it as a Friday sermon. al-Sharīf

طبّكم القوم رجال أمثالـكم أق َ وْلًا بغير علم وغفلة من غير ورع وطمعًا في غير
حقّ . 1.30من كلام له عليه السلام في معنى قتل عثمان لو أمرت به لـكنت قاتل
ً ا أو نهيت عنه لـكنت ناصرًا غير أنّ من نصره لا يستطيع أن يقول خذله من أنا
خير منه ومن خذله لا يستطيع أن يقول نصره من هو خير منّي. وأنا جامع لـكم
أمره ٱستأثر فأساء الأثرة وجزعتم فأسأتم الجزع ولله حكم واقع في المستأثر
والجازع. 1.31عوقو لبق ريبزلا ىلإ هللا همحر ساّبعلا نب هللا دبع ذفنأ اّ مل
مالسلا هيلع هل مالك نمو الحرب يوم الجمل يستفيئه إلى طاعته. قال له عليه
السلام لا تلقينّ طلحة فإنّك إن تلقه تجدهكالثور عاقصًا قرنه يركب الصعب ويقول
هو الذلول ولـكن ٱلق الزبير فإنّه ألين عريكة فقل له يقول لك ٱبن خالك
عرفتني بالحجاز وأنكرتني بالعراق فما عدا ممّا بدا. وهو عليه السلام أوّل من
سمعت منه هذه الكلمة أعني ⟩فما عدا ممّا بدا⟨. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī
