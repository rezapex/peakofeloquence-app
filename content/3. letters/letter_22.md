After invoking Allah and praising the Holy Prophet (s) be it known to you that villagers and 
farmers of the provinces under you, complain of your harshness, arrogance and cruelty. They 
complain that you consider them mean, humble and insignificant and treat them scornfully. I

and harshly either. They are governed by us, they have made certain agreements with us and 
we are obliged to respect and honour the terms of those agreements. 
Therefore, be kind to them in future, tolerate them and give them due respect, but at the same 
time keep your prestige and guard well the position and honour of the authority which you 
hold. Always govern with a soft but strong hand. Treat them as they individually deserve, 
kindly or harshly and with respect or with contempt.
