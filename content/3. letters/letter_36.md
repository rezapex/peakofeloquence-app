description: The following is a letter to the people of Basra.
---

Your activities revealed your disloyalty to Islam, your enmity towards me and the intense 
malice you nurse against me, the things which you wanted to conceal and which you knew so 
well. I have forgiven the offenders and I do not want to punish those whose once faced me in 
the battlefield and then fled. I have accepted the excuses of those who came back to me 
repenting. 
If you again do what you have done once before, if you readopt schism and if once again 
advice of unwise and wicked people drives you towards animosity against Islam, then 
remember, I shall chastise you. I shall invade you at the head of my army. 
If you compel me to that then remember that this invasion will be such that the Battle of 
Jamal will look like a child's play when compared to it. 
I know you all and appreciate the sincerity of those who are faithful to me and the excellence 
of those who come to me with their sincere advice and good wishes. 
I am willing to forgive and to forget those who have wronged me and to requite those who 
have exhibited fidelity towards me.
