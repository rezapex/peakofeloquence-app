You have very cunningly tried to couch them in flowery words and\nphrases. You have done this because of your natural evil-mindedness and because of the\nenvy, enmity and malice you bear against me.\n(These kinds of letters show that they have been written from a person who has no inner-light\nand no benevolent guide to show him the true path. Avarice, self-aggrandizement and lust of\npower prompted him to do so and he jumped at the suggestion. It is a letter from a person,\nwhom selfishness has led astray and who has lost his sense of proportion and therefore, it\ncontains no sense and no real worth. Some commentators consider the following passage as a\npart of the letter above:)\nRemember that the allegiance and fidelity sworn to me is such that it does not require\nreconsideration on the part of those who have sworn it nor are they at liberty (from a religious\npoint of view) to go back upon it. Therefore, those who belittle it, scoff at it, or go back upon\nit are hypocrites and traitors."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_7.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_7.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"P3U0iiFMRT"}
