that the\ngreatest argument of muhajirun against ansar and the basis of the\nformer's success was this very point that since they were the kith\nand kin of the Prophet no one else could deserve the Caliphate. On\nthis very ground the big crowd of ansar became ready to lay down\ntheir weapons before three muhajirun, and the latter succeeded in\nwinning the Caliphate by presenting their distinction of descent.\nThus in connection with the events of Saqifah at-Tabari writes that\nwhen the ansar assembled in Saqifah of Bani Sa`idah to swear\nallegiance on the hand of Sa`d ibn `Ubadah, somehow Abu Bakr,\n`Umar and Abu `Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah also got the hint and reached\nthere. `Umar had thought out something for this occasion and he\nrose to speak but Abu Bakr stopped him, and he himself stood up.\nAfter praise of Allah and the immigration of the muhajirun and their\nprecedence in Islam he said:"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThey are those who worshipped Allah first of all and accepted belief\nin Allah and his Prophet's friends and his Kith and Kin.

If the\nmuhajirun have precedence over you in some matters you too have\nprecedence over them in other matters. You gave them refuge in your\nhouses. You are the fighting arm of Islam. With your help Islam\nstood on its own feet. In your cities prayer of Allah was\nestablished with freedom. Save yourselves from division and\ndispersion and stick to your right unitedly.

You are the people who supported us and helped us in every\nmanner. Do not now change your ways and do not give up your\nbehaviour.\" But the ansar refused to change their mind. They were\nprepared to swear allegiance to Sa`d and people just wanted to\napproach him when a man of Sa`d's tribe Bashir ibn `Amr\nal-Khazraji stood up and said:"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n\"No doubt we came forward for jihad, and gave support to the\nreligion, but our aim in doing thus was to please Allah and to obey\nHis Prophet.

Muhammad (S) was from\nQuraysh and they have a greater right for it, and are more\nappropriate for it.\" As soon as Bashir uttered these words division\noccurred among the ansar, and this was his aim, because he could not\nsee a man of his own tribe rising so high. The muhajirun took the\nbest advantage of this division among the ansar, and `Umar and Abu\n`Ubaydah decided to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr. They had just got\nforward for the act when Bashir first of all put his hand on that of\nAbu Bakr and after that `Umar and Abu `Ubaydah swore the\nallegiance.

That is, if muhajirun's claim was acceded for being\nfrom the lineal tree of the Prophet, how can those who are the\nfruits of this tree be ignored? It is strange that Abu Bakr who\nconnects with the Prophet in the seventh generation above and `Umar\nwho connects with him in the ninth generation above may be held of\nthe tribe and family of the Prophet and he who was his first cousin,\nhe is refused the status of a brother.]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-67","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 67"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2. sermons:Sermons:67.
