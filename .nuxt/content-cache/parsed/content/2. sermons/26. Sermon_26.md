The position of\nthis mutual settlement was that when Amir al-mu'minin sent Jarir\nibn `Abdillah al-Bajali to Mu`awiyah to secure his allegiance he\ndetained Jarir under the excuse of giving a reply, and in the\nmeantime he began exploring how far the people of Syria would\nsupport him. When he succeeded in making them his supporters by\nrousing them to avenge `Uthman's blood he consulted his brother\n`Utbah ibn Abi Sufyan. He suggested, \"If in this matter `Amr ibn\nal-`As was associated he would solve most of the difficulties\nthrough his sagacity, but he would not be easily prepared to\nstabilise your authority unless he got the price he desired for it.\nIf you are ready for this he would prove the best counsellor and\nhelper.\" Mu`awiyah liked this suggestion, sent for `Amr ibn\nal-`As and discussed with him, and eventually it was settled that\nhe would avenge `Uthman's blood by holding Amir al-mu'minin\nliable for it in exchange for the governorship of Egypt, and by\nwhatever means possible would not let Mu`awiyah's authority in\nSyria suffer. Consequently, both of them fulfilled the agreement and\nkept their words fully.]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"part-of-the-same-sermon-in-describing-his-condition-before-allegiance-was-paid-to-him-after-the-death-of-the-holy-prophet","depth":2,"text":"Part of the same sermon in describing his condition before allegiance was paid to him (after the death of the Holy Prophet)"},{"id":"part-of-the-same-sermon-on-the-settlement-between-muawiyah-and-amr-ibn-al-as","depth":2,"text":"Part of the same sermon on the settlement between Mu'awiyah and 'Amr ibn al-'As"},{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-26","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 26"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2. sermons:26.
