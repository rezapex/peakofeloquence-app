If you\nare satisfied, you do as you will.\" He said he would come the next\nday to discuss the matter. Amir al-mu'minin then cautioned him,\n\"Look, on going from here do not get mislead by others and do not\nadopt any other course. If you have the will to understand, I will\nget you out of this wrong path and put you on the course of\nguidance.\" After this conversation he went away, but his\ncountenance indicated he was bent on revolt, and would not see\nreason by any means. And so it happened. He stuck to his point and\non reaching his place he said to his tribesmen, \"When we are\ndetermined to abandon Amir al-mu'minin there is no use going to\nhim. We should do what we have decided to do.\" On this occasion\n`Abdullah ibn Qu`ayn al Azdi also went to them to enquire, but\nwhen he came to know the position he asked Mudrik ibn ar-Rayyan\nan-Naji to speak to him and to apprise him of the ruinous\nconsequence of this rebellion, whereupon Mudrik assured him that\nthis man would not be allowed to take any step. Consequently,\n`Abdullah came back satisfied and related the whole matter before\nAmir al-mu'minin on returning the next day. Amir al-mu'minin said,\n\"Let us see what happens when he comes. \" But when the appointed\nhour passed and he did not turn up Amir al-mu'minin asked\n`Abdullah to go and see what the matter was and what was the cause\nfor the delay. On reaching there `Abdullah found that all of them\nhad left. When he returned to Amir al-mu'minin he spoke as in this\nsermon."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe fate that befell al-Khirrit ibn Rashid an-Naji has been stated\nunder Sermon 44.]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-181","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 181"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2. sermons:60.sermon_60.md","_source":"content","_file":"2. sermons/60.sermon_60.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"5FlfZWoE6i"}
