Among these\npeople some had actually been duped and believed that they were\nbeing asked to abide by the Qur'an but there were others who had\nbecome weary of the long period of war and had lost courage. Then\npeople got a good opportunity to stop the war, and so they cried\nhoarse for its postponement. There were others who had accompanied\nAmir al-mu'minin because of his temporal authority but did not\nsupport him by heart, nor did they aim at victory for him. There\nwere some people who had expectations with Mu`awiyah, and had\nstarted attaching hopes to him for this, while there were some who\nwere, from the very beginning, in league with him. In these\ncircumstances and with this type of the army it was really due to\nAmir al-mu'minin's political ability and competence of military\ncontrol and administration that he carried the war up to this stage,\nand if Mu`awiyah had not adopted this trick there could have been\nno doubt in Amir al-mu'minin's victory because the military power\nof the Syrian forces had been exhausted and defeat was hovering over\nits head. In this connection, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid writes:"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nMalik al-Ashtar had reached Mu`awiyah and grabbed him by the neck.\nThe entire might of the Syrians had been smashed.
