Thus, by mentioning his companionship of\nthe Prophet, his personal position, and his kinship to the Prophet\nas against the two previous Caliphs, his intention was to make him\nrealise his duties; in any case, this was obviously not an occasion\nfor eulogising him, so that its later portion can be disregarded and\nthe whole speech be regarded as an eulogy of his attainments,\nbecause from its very beginning it is evident that whatever `Uthman\ndid, he did it wilfully, that nothing was done without his knowledge\nor his being informed, and that he could not be held unaccountable\nfor it because of his being unaware of it. If the adoption of a line\nof action which made the whole Islamic world raise hue and cry in\nspite of his having being a companion of the Prophet, having heard\nhis instructions, having seen his behaviour and having been\nacquainted with the commandments of Islam can be regarded as a\ndistinction, then this taunt may also be regarded as praise. If that\nis not a distinction then this too cannot be called and eulogy. In\nfact, the words about which it is argued that they are in praise are\nenough to prove the seriousness of his crime, because a crime in\nignorance and unawareness is not so serious as the weight given to\nthe seriousness of the commission of a crime despite knowledge and\nawareness. Consequently a person who is unaware of the rise and fall\nof a road and stumbles in the dark night is excusable but a person\nwho is aware of the rise and fall of the road and stumbled in broad\nday light is liable to be blamed. If on this occasion he is told\nthat he has eyes and is also aware of the rise and fall of the way,\nit would not mean that his vastness of knowledge or the brightness\nof his eye-sight is being praised, but the intention would be that\nhe did not notice the pitfalls despite his eyes, and did not walk\nproperly, and that therefore for him, having or not having eyes is\nthe same, and knowing or not knowing is equal."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIn this connection great stress in laid on his being a son-in-law,\nnamely that the Prophet married his two daughters Ruqayyah and Umm\nKulthum to him one after the other. Before taking this to be a\ndistinction, the real nature of `Uthman's son-in-lawship should be\nseen. History shows that in this matter `Uthman did not enjoy the\ndistinction of being the first, but before him Ruqayyah and Umm\nKulthum had been married to two sons of Abu Lahab namely `Utbah and\n`Utaybah, but despite their being sons-in-law, they have not been\nincluded among people of position of pre-prophethood period. How\nthen can this be regarded as a source of position without any\npersonal merit, when there is no authority about the importance of\nthis relationship, nor was any importance attached to this matter in\nsuch a way that there might have been some competition between\n`Uthman and some other important personality in this regard and\nthat his selection for it might have given him prominence, or that\nthese two girls might have been shown to possess an important\nposition in history, tradition or biography as a result of which\nthis relationship could be given special importance and regarded as\na distinction for him? If the marriage of these two daughters with\n`Utbah and `Utaybah in the pre-prophethood period is held as\nlawful on the ground that marriage with unbelievers had not till\nthen been made unlawful, then in `Uthman's case also the condition\nfor lawfulness was his acceptance of Islam, there is no doubt that\nhe had pronounced the kalimah ash-shahadatayn (there is no god but\nAllah and Muhammad is His Messenger) and had accepted Islam\noutwardly. As such this marriage can be held a proof of his outward\nIslam, but no other honour can be proved through it. Again, it is\nalso not agreed that these two were the real daughters of the\nMessenger of Allah, because there is one group which denies them to\nbe his real daughters, and regards them as being the daughters of\nKhadijah's sister Halah, or the daughters of her own previous\nhusband. Thus, Abu'l-Qasim al-Kufi (d. 352 A.H.) writes:"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n\"When the Messenger of Allah married Khadijah, then some time\nthereafter Halah died leaving two daughters, one named Zaynab and\nthe other named Ruqayyah and both of them were brought up by the\nProphet and Khadijah and they maintained them, and it was the custom\nbefore Islam that a child was assigned to whoever brought him up.\"\n(al-lstighathah, p. 69)"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIbn Hisham has written about the issues of Hadrat Khadijah as\nfollows:"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n\"Before marriage with the Prophet she was married to Abi Halah ibn\nMalik.

Therefore, before\nputting it forth as a matter for pride the real status of the\ndaughters should be noted and a glance should be cast at `Uthman's\nconduct.
