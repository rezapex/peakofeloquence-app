First reason is, because he and his\nfather like most of the people of his native place pursued the\nindustry of weaving cloth. So, in order to refer to the lowliness of\nhis occupation he has been called 'weaver'. Yamanis had other\noccupations also but mostly this profession was followed among them.\nDescribing their occupations Khalid ibn Safwan has mentioned this\none first of all: \"What can I say about a people among whom there\nare only weavers, leather dyers, monkey keepers and donkey riders.\nThe hoopoe found them out, the mouse flooded them and a woman ruled\nover them\". (al-Bayan wa't-tabyin, vol. 1, p. 130)"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe second reason is that \"hiyakah\" means walking by bending on\neither side, and since out of pride and conceit this man used to\nwalk shrugging his shoulders and making bends in his body, he has\nbeen called \"hayik\"."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe third reason is --- and it is more conspicuous and clear ---\nthat he has been called a weaver to denote his foolishness and\nlowliness because every low person is proverbially known as a\nweaver. Their wisdom and sagacity can be well gauged by the fact\nthat their follies had become proverbial, while nothing attains\nproverbial status without peculiar characteristics. Now, that Amir\nal-mu'minin has also confirmed it no further argument or reasoning\nis needed."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe fourth reason is that by this is meant the person who conspires\nagainst Allah and the Holy Prophet and prepares webs of which is the\npeculiarity of hypocrites. Thus, in Wasa'il ash-Shi`ah (vol.\n12, p. 101) it is stated: It was mentioned before Imam Ja`far\nas-Sadiq (p.b.u.h.) that the weaver is accursed when he explained\nthat the weaver implies the person who concocts against Allah and\nthe Prophet."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAfter the word weaver Amir al-mu'minin has used the word hypocrite,\nand there is no conjunction in between them in order to emphasise\nthe nearness of meaning thereof. Then, on the basis of this\nhypocrisy and concealment of truth he declared him deserving of the\ncurse of Allah and all others, as Allah the Glorified says: Verily,\nthose that conceal what we have sent of (Our) manifest evidences and\nguidance, after what we have (so) clearly shown for mankind in the\nBook (they are), those that Allah doth curse them and (also) curse\nthem all those who curse (such ones). (Qur'an, 2:159)"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAfter this Amir al-mu'minin says that \"You could not avoid the\ndegradation of being prisoner when you were unbeliever, nor did\nthese ignominies spare you after acceptance of Islam, and you were\ntaken prisoner.\" When an unbeliever the event of his being taken\nprisoner occurred in this way that when the tribe of Banu Murad\nkilled his father Qays, he (al-Ash`ath) collected the warriors of\nBanu Kindah and divided them in three groups. Over one group he\nhimself took the command, and on the others he placed Kabs ibn\nHani' and al-Qash`am ibn Yazid al-Arqam as chiefs, and set off to\ndeal with Banu Murad. But as misfortune would have it instead of\nBanu Murad he attacked Banu al-Harith ibn Ka`b. The result was that\nKabs ibn Hani' and al-Qash`am ibn Yazid al-Arqam were killed and\nthis man was taken prisoner alive. Eventually he got a release by\npaying three thousand camels as ransom. In Amir al-mu'minin's\nwords, \"Your wealth or birth could not save you from either,\" the\nreference is not to real 'fidyah' (release money) because he was\nactually released on payment of release money but the intention is\nthat neither plenty of wealth nor his high position and prestige in\nhis tribe could save him from this ignominy, and he could not\nprotect himself from being a prisoner ."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe event of his second imprisonment is that when the Holy Prophet\nof Islam passed away from this world a rebellion occurred in the\nregion of Hadramawt for repelling which Caliph Abu Bakr wrote to the\ngovernor of the place Ziyad ibn Labid al-Bayadi. al-Ansari that he\nshould secure allegiance and collect zakat and charities from those\npeople. When Ziyad ibn Labid went to the tribe of Banu `Amr ibn\nMu`awiyah for collection of zakat he took keen fancy for a\nshe-camel of Shaytan ibn Hujr which was very handsome and of huge\nbody. He jumped over it and took possession of it. Shaytan ibn Hujr\ndid not agree to spare it and said to him to take over some other\nshe-camel in its place but Ziyad would not agree. Shaytan sent for\nhis brother al-`Adda' ibn Hujr for his support. On coming he too\nhad a talk but Ziyad insisted on his point and did not, by any\nmeans, consent to keep off his hand from that she-camel. At last\nboth these brothers appealed to Masruq ibn Ma`di Karib for help.\nConsequently, Masruq also used his influence so that Ziyad might\nleave the she-camel but he refused categorically, whereupon Masruq\nbecame enthusiastic and untying the she-camel handed it over to\nShaytan. On this Ziyad was infuriated and collecting his men became\nready to fight. On the other side Banu Wali`ah also assembled to\nface them, but could not defeat Ziyad and were badly beaten at his\nhands. Their women were taken away and property was looted.\nEventually those who had survived were obliged to take refuge under\nthe protection of al-Ash`ath. Al-Ash`ath promised assistance on\nthe condition that he should be acknowledged ruler of the area.\nThose people agreed to this condition and his coronation was also\nformally solemnised. After having his authority acknowledged he\narranged an army and set out to fight Ziyad. On the other side Abu\nBakr had written to the chief of Yemen, al-Muhajir ibn Abi Umayyah\nto go for the help of Ziyad with a contingent. Al-Muhajir was coming\nwith his contingent when they came face to face. Seeing each other\nthey drew swords and commenced fighting at ad-Zurqan. In the end\nal-Ash`ath fled from the battle-field and taking his remaining men\nclosed himself in the fort of an-Nujayr. The enemy was such as to\nlet them alone. They laid siege around the fort. Al-Ash`ath thought\nhow long could he remain shut up in the fort with this lack of\nequipment and men, and that he should think out some way of escape.\nSo one night he stealthily came out of the fort and met Ziyad and\nal-Muhajir and conspired with them that if they gave asylum to nine\nmembers of his family he would get the fort gate opened. They\naccepted this term and asked him to write for them the names of\nthose nine persons. He wrote down the nine names and made them over\nto them, but acting on his traditional wisdom forgot to write his\nown name in that list. After settling this he told his people that\nhe has secured protection for them and the gate of the fort should\nbe opened. When the gate was opened Ziyad forces pounced upon them.\nThey said they had been promised protection whereupon Ziyad's army\nsaid that this was wrong and that al-Ash`ath had asked protection\nonly for nine members of his house, whose names preserved with them.\nIn short eight hundred persons were put to sword and hands of\nseveral women were chopped off, while according to the settlement\nnine men were left off, but the case of al-Ash`ath became\ncomplicated. Eventually it was decided he should be sent to Abu Bakr\nand he should decided about him. At last he was sent to Medina in\nchains along with a thousand women prisoners. On the way relations\nand others, men and women, all hurled curses at him and the women\nwere calling him traitor and one who got his own people put to\nsword. Who else can be a greater traitor? However, when he reached\nMedina Abu Bakr released him and on that occasion he was married to\nUmm Farwah.]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-19","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 19"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2. sermons:222.sermon_222.md","_source":"content","_file":"2. sermons/222.sermon_222.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"bu6gjNdmTK"}
