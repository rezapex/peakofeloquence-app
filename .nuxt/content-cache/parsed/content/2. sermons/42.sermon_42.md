For him, this period was of the severest oppression\nand destitution. The unbelievers of the Quraysh had closed all the\ndoors of livelihood upon him, and had left no deficiency in\ninflicting hardships upon him, so much so that in order to take his\nlife they began contriving how to do away with him. Forty of their\nnobles assembled in the hall of audience (Dar an-Nadwah) for\nconsultation, and decided that one individual should be picked out\nfrom every tribe and they should jointly attack him. In this way,\nBanu Hashim would not dare to face all the tribes, and the matter\nwould quieten down on the payment of blood price. To give a\npractical shape to this scheme, these people sat in ambush near the\nhouse of the Prophet on the night of the first of Rabi` al-awwal,\nso that when the prophet slept in his bed he would be attacked. On\nthis side the preparation for killing him was complete, and on the\nother side Allah informed him of all the intrigues of the Quraysh\nunbelievers and commanded him to make `Ali (p.b.u.h.) sleep on his\nbed and himself to emigrate to Medina. The Prophet sent for `Ali\n(p.b.u.h.) and disclosing to him his plan, said: \"Ali, you lie on\nmy bed.\" Amir al-mu'minin enquired: \"O' Messenger of Allah, will\nyour life be saved by my sleeping here?\" The Prophet said: \"Yes.\"\nHearing this Amir al-mu'minin performed a prostration in\nthanks-giving and, exposing himself fully to the danger, lay on the\nProphet's bed while the Prophet left from the rear door. The\nQuraysh unbelievers were peeping and getting ready for the attack\nbut Abu Lahab said: \"It is not proper to attack in the night\nbecause there are women and children also in the house. When morning\ndawns you attack him, but keep watch during night that he should not\nmove anywhere.\" Consequently, they kept their eyes on the bed\nthroughout the night and soon, on the appearance of the dawn,\nproceeded forward stealthily. Hearing the sound of their footsteps,\nAmir al-mu'minin removed the covering from his face and stood up.\nThe Quraysh gazed at him with stretched eyes as to whether it was an\nillusion or fact. After making sure that it was `Ali they enquired,\n\"Where is Muhammad?\" and `Ali replied, \"Did you entrust him to\nme, that now you are asking me?\" They had no reply to this. Men ran\nto chase him but found footprints only up to the cave of Thawr.\nBeyond that there were neither footprints nor any sign of hiding in\nthe cave. They came back bewildered while the Prophet after staying\nin the cave for three days left for Medina. Amir al-mu'minin passed\nthese three days in Mecca, returned to the people their properties\nlying in trust with the Prophet and set off towards Medina to join\nthe Prophet. Upto al-`Arj which is a place between Mecca and\nMedina, he kept getting news about the Prophet and he continued his\nanxious march in his search till he met the Prophet at Quba on the\ntwelfth of Rabi` al-awwal, and entered Medina with him.
