Therefore\nwhen on Monday the 12th Rajeb, 36 A.H. he returned to Kufah after\nthe battle of Jamal he sent Jarir ibn `Abdallah al-Bajali with a\nletter to Mu`awiyah at Damascus wherein he wrote that the muhajirun\nand the ansar had sworn allegiance to him and that he too should\nfirst swear him allegiance and thereafter place the case of\n`Uthman's killing before him so that he could pass verdict thereon\naccording to the Qur'an and Sunnah. But Mu`awiyah detained Jarir\non several pretexts and after consulting `Amr ibn al-`As staged a\nrevolt on the excuse of `Uthman's killing, and with the help of\nimportant persons of Syria convinced the ignorant people that the\nliability for `Uthman's life lay on `Ali (p.b.u.h) and that he,\nwith his conduct had encouraged the besiegers and had given them\nprotection. Meanwhile he hung the blood-stained shirt of `Uthman\nand the amputated fingers of his wife Na'ilah bint al-Farafisah on\nthe pulpit in the Central Mosque of Damascus around which seventy\nthousand Syrians cried and swore the pledge to avenge `Uthman's\nblood. When Mu`awiyah had roused the feelings of the Syrians to\nsuch an extent that they were determined to lay down their lives and\nbe killed, he secured their allegiance on the cause of avenging\n`Uthman's blood and busied himself in equipping for the battle.\nThereafter, he showed all this to Jarir and then sent him back\nmortified."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWhen Amir al-mu'minin learnt of these matters through Jarir ibn\n`Abdallah al-Bajali he was forced to rise against Mu`awiyah, and\nordered Malik ibn Habib al-Yarbu`i to mobilise the forces in the\nvalley of An-Nukhaylah. Consequently, people from the suburbs of\nKufah began arriving there in large numbers, till they exceeded\neighty thousand. First of all, Amir al-mu'minin sent a vanguard\ncontingent, eight thousand strong, under Ziyad ibn an-Nadr\nal-Harithi and another of four thousand strong under Shurayh ibn\nHani al-Harithi towards Syria. After the departure of this vanguard\ncontingent he himself set out for Syria at the head of the remaining\narmy on Wednesday the 5th of Shawwal. When he was out of the\nboundary of Kufah he offered zuhr (noon) prayer and after staying at\nDayr Abi Musa, Nahr (river) Nars, Qubbat Qubbin, Babil, Dayr Ka`b,\nKarbala', Sabat, Bahurasini, al-Anbar and al-Jazirah arrived at\nar-Riqqah. The people of this place were in favour of `Uthman, and\nat this very place Simak ibn Makhtamah al-Asadi was putting up with\nhis eight hundred men. These people had left Kufah to join\nMu`awiyah after deserting Amir al-mu'minin; when they had seen\nAmir al-mu'minin's force they had dismantled the bridge over the\nRiver Euphrates so that Amir al-mu'minin's army should not cross\nover to the other side of the River. But at the threatening of Malik\nibn al-Harith al-Ashtar an-Nakha`i they were frightened, and after\nconsultations among themselves they put the bridge together again\nand Amir al-mu'minin passed over it with his army. When he alighted\non the other side of the River he saw that Ziyad and Shurayh were\nalso putting up there along with their men since both of them had\nadopted the land route. When, on reaching here, they found that\nMu`awiyah was advancing with his armies towards the Euphrates and\nthinking that they would not be able to face him, they stopped there\nwaiting for Amir al-mu'minin. When they had given the reason for\ntheir stopping there, Amir al-mu'minin accepted their plea and sent\nthem forward. When they reached Sur ar-Rum they found that Abu\nal-A`war as-Sulami was camping there with his army. Both of them\ninformed Amir al-mu'minin of this, whereupon he despatched Ma1ik\nibn al-Harith al-Ashtar an-Nakha`i in their wake as the Officer in\nCommand and cautioned him not to initiate the fighting but to try to\ncounsel them and apprise them of the correct position as far as\npossible. In this way, on reaching there Malik al-Ashtar encamped a\nlittle distance away. Fighting could have commenced any moment, but\nhe did not interfere with the other side nor did he take any step by\nwhich fighting could have been commenced. But Abu al-A`war suddenly\nattacked them at night, whereupon they took their swords out of the\nsheaths and prepared to repulse them. Clashes between the two sides\nwent on for sometime but in the end, taking benefit of the darkness\nof night Abu al-A`war fled away. Since fighting had already\ncommenced, soon after the appearance of dawn an Iraqi commander,\nHashim ibn `Utbah al-Mirqal az-Zuhri, took his position in the\nbattlefield. From the other side also a contingent came to face him,\nand the flames of fighting rose high. At last Malik al-Ashtar\nchallenged Abu al-A`war to fight him, but he did not dare to face\nhim, and towards the evening Malik al-Ashtar went onwards with his\nmen. The next day Amir al-mu'minin reached there with his force and\nset off for Siffin with the vanguard contingent and other forces.\nMu`awiyah had already reached there and had set up his bases. He\nhad also placed a guard on the Euphrates and had occupied it. On\nreaching there Amir al-mu'minin sent him word to remove the guard\nfrom Euphrates, but he refused, whereupon the Iraqis took out their\nswords and in a courageous attack captured the Euphrates. When this\nstage was over Amir al-mu'minin sent Bashir ibn `Amr al-Ansari,\nSa`id ibn Qays al-Hamdani and Shabath ibn Rib`i at-Tamimi to\nMu`awiyah to apprise him of the consequences of war and to make him\nagree to settlement and allegiance. But his reply was that they\ncould not by any means let `Uthman's blood remain neglected, and\nthat now the sword alone would arbitrate between them. Consequently\nin the month of Dhi'l-hijjah 36 A.H. both the parties decided on\nwar and warriors from each side came out into the field to face\ntheir adversary. Those who entered the battlefield from Amir\nal-mu'minin's side were: Hujr ibn `Adi al-Kindi, Shabath ibn\nRib`i at-Tamimi, Khalid ibn al-Mu`ammar, Ziyad ibn an-Nadr\nal-Harithi, Ziyad ibn Khasafah at-Taymi, Sa`id ibn Qays al-Hamdani,\nQays ibn Sa`d al-Ansari and Malik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar\nan-Nakha`i while from the Syrians there were, `Abd ar-Rahman ibn\nKhalid ibn Walid al-Makhzuni, Abu al-A`war as-Sulami, Habib ibn\nMaslamah al-Fihri, `Abdallah ibn Dhi'l-Kala` al-Himyari,\n`Ubaydallah ibn `Umar ibn al-Khattab, Shurahbil ibn Simt al-Kindi,\nand Hamzah ibn Malik al-Hamdani. When the month of Dhi'l-hijjah\ncame to end the fighting had to be stopped for Muharram, but from\nthe first of Safar fighting was resumed and both parties arrayed\nthemselves opposite each other, equipped with swords, spears and\nother weapons. On Amir al-mu'minin's side Malik al-Ashtar was in\ncommand of the horsemen and `Ammar ibn Yasir of the foot soldiers\nof Kufah while Sahl ibn Hunayf al-Ansari was in command of the\nhorsemen and Qays ibn Sa`d of the foot soldiers of Basrah.

Mu`awiyah replied: \"l am not prepared to\nwaste my life ar your taunting.\" Saying this he went back. When\nAmir al-mu'minin saw him retreating he smiled and himself too\nreturned. The daring with which Amir al-mu'minin led the attacks in\nSiffin can only be called a miraculous feat. Thus, whenever he came\nout challenging in the battlefield, the enemy lines were dispersed\ninto utter disarray and confusion, and even courageous combatants\nhesitated to appear against him. That is why on a few occasions he\ncame onto the battlefield in changed dress so that the enemy should\nnot recognise him and someone should be prepared to engage with him\npersonally.

When both\nthe lines had come face to face with each other, the valiant\nsoldiers drew out their swords and pounced upon one another like\nferocious lions, and fighting raged on all sides. The banner of the\nright wing Amir al-mu'minin's army was revolving in the hands of\nBanu Hamdan. Whenever anyone of them fell, martyred, someone else\nwould pick up the banner. First of all Kurayb ibn Shurayh raised the\nbanner, on his fall Shurahbil ibn Shurayh took it up, then Marthad\nibn Shurayh, then Hubayrah ibn Shurayh then Yarim ibn Shurayh, then\nSumayr ibn Shurayh and after the killing of all these six brothers\nthe banner was taken up by Sufyan, then `Abd, then Kurayb, the\nthree sons of Zayd, who all fell martyred. After that the banner was\nlifted by two brothers (sons) of Bashir namely `Umayr and al-Harith\nand when they too fell martyred, Wahb ibn Kurayb took up the banner.\nOn this day the enemy's greater attention was on the right wing and\nits assaults were so fierce that the men lost ground and began to\nretreat from the battlefield. Only three hundred men remained with\nthe Officer in Command `Abdullah ibn Budayl. On seeing this Amir\nal-mu'minin asked Malik al-Ashtar to call them back and challenge\nthem as to where they were fleeing. \"If the days of life are over\nthey cannot avoid death by running away.\" Now the defeat of the\nright wing could not be without effect on the left wing, so Amir\nal-mu'minin turned to the left wing and advanced forward, forcing\nthrough the enemy lines, whereupon a slave of Banu Umayyah named\nAhmar said to him, \"Allah may make me die if I fail to slay you\ntoday.\" On hearing this Amir al-mu'minin's slave Kaysan leapt\nover him but was killed by him. When Amir al-mu'minin saw this he\ncaught him by the skirt of his armour and, picking him up, threw him\ndown so forcefully that all his joints were smashed, whereupon Imam\nHasan (p.b.u.h.) and Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah came forward and\ndespatched him to Hell. Meanwhile, after having been called to Malik\nal-Ashtar and his having made them feel ashamed, the retreaters came\nback and again assaulted so steadfastly that pushing back the enemy\nthey reached the place where `Abdullah ibn Budayl was surrounded by\nthe enemy.

When Mu`awiyah noticed him close by he\nordered him to be stoned, as a result of which he was overpowered\nand the Syrians crowded over him and killed him. When Malik\nal-Ashtar saw this he proceeded forward with the combatants of Banu\nHamdan and Banu Madh'hij for an attack on Mu`awiyah, and began\ndispersing the contingent on guard around him. When, out of the five\ncircles of his guards only one remained to be dispersed, Mu`awiyah\nput his foot in the stirrup of his horse in order to run away, but\non someone's encouragement again stopped. On another side of the\nbattlefield a tumult was raging from one end to the other by the\nswords of `Ammar ibn Yasir and Hashim ibn `Utbah. From whatever\nside `Ammar passed, the companions (of the Holy Prophet) flocked\naround him and then made such a joint assault that destruction\nspread throughout the enemy lines. When Mu`awiyah saw them\nadvancing he threw his fresh forces towards them. But he continued\ndisplaying the excellence of his bravery under the storm of swords\nand spears. At last Abu al-`Adiyah al-Juhani hit him with a spear\nfrom which he could not balance himself and then Ibn Hawiy (Jawn\nas-Saksiki) came forward and slew him. `Ammar ibn Yasir's death\ncaused tumult in Mu`awiyah's ranks because about him they had\nheard the Holy Prophet (S) having said: \" `Ammar will be killed at\nthe hands of a rebellious party.\" Thus before he fell as martyr\nDhu'l-Kala` had said to `Amr ibn al-`As: \"I see `Ammar on\n`Ali's side; are we that rebellious party?\" `Amr ibn al-`As had\nassured him that eventually `Ammar would join them, but when he\nkilled fighting on `Ali's side the rebellious party stood exposed\nand no scope was left for any other interpretation. Nevertheless\nMu`awiyah started telling the Syrians that: \"We did not kill\n`Ammar, but `Ali did it because he brought him to the\nbattlefield.\" When Amir al-mu'minin heard this cunning sentence he\nremarked: \"In that case the Holy Prophet (S) killed Hamzah as he\nhad brought him to the battlefield of Uhud.\" Hashim ibn `Utbah\nalso fell in this conflict. He was killed by al-Harith ibn Mundhir\nat-Tanukhi. After him the banner of the contingent was taken over by\nhis son `Abdullah."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nWhen such fearless warriors were gone Amir al-mu'minin said to the\nwarriors from the tribes of Hamdan and Rabi`ah: \"To me you are\nlike armour and spear.
