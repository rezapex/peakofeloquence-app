Mu`awiyah's influence and control was the result of\nthese devices and ways in following which he knew no impediment nor\nany obstacle of what is lawful or unlawful, nor did fear of the Day\nof Judgement prevent him from acting fearlessly.

He did not care for religion nor did he ever think of\ndivine chastisement.

When he saw that success was not possible\nwithout entangling Amir al-mu'minin in war he roused Talhah and\naz-Zubayr against him. When success could not be achieved by this\nmeans he instigated the Syrians and brought about the civil war of\nSiffin. And when his rebellious position had become known by the\nkilling of `Ammar, he at once duped the people by saying that `Ali\nwas responsible for killing him as he had brought him into the\nbattlefield; and on another occasion he interpreted the words\n'rebellious party' occurring in the saying of the Prophet to mean\n'avenging party' intending to prove that `Ammar would be killed\nby the group that would seek revenge of `Uthman's blood, although\nthe next portion of this saying namely 'he will call them towards\nParadise while they will call him to Hell,' does not leave any\nscope for interpretation. When there was no hope of victory even by\nthese cunning means, he contrived to raise the Qur'an on spears,\nalthough in his view neither the Qur'an nor its commandments\ncarried any weight. If he had really aimed at a decision by the\nQur'an, he should have put this demand before the commencement of\nthe battle, and when it became known to him that the decision had\nbeen secured by `Amr ibn al-`As by deceiving Abu Musa al-Ash`ari,\nand that it did not have even a remote connection with the Qur'an,\nhe should not have accepted it and should have punished `Amr ibn\nal-`As for this cunning, or at least should have warned and rebuked\nhim. But on the contrary, his performance was much appreciated and\nin reward he was made the Governor of Egypt.\""},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"In contrast to this Amir al-mu'minin's conduct was a high specimen\nof religious law and ethics. He kept in view the requirements of\ntruth and righteousness even in adverse circumstances and did not\nallow his chaste life to be tarnished by the views of deceit and\ncontrivance. If he wished he could face cunning by cunning, and\nMu`awiyah's shameful activities could have been answered by\nsimilar activities. For example, when he put a guard on the\nEuphrates and stopped the supply of its water (to Amir\nal-mu'minin's men), then the supply of water could have been cut\nfrom them also on the grounds that since they had occupied the\nEuphrates it was lawful to retaliate, and in this way they could be\noverpowered by weakening their fighting power. But Amir al-mu'minin\ncould never tarnish his hands with such an inhuman act which was not\npermitted by any law or code of ethics, although common people\nregard such acts against the enemy as lawful and call this duplicity\nof character for achievement of success, a stroke of policy and\nadministrative ability. But Amir al-mu'minin could never think of\nstrengthening his power by fraud or duplicity of behaviour on any\noccasion. Thus when people advised him to retain the officers of the\ndays of `Uthman in their position and to befriend Talhah and\naz-Zubayr by assigning them governorship of Kufah and Basrah, and\nmake use of Mu`awiyah's ability in administration by giving him\nthe government of Syria, Amir al-mu'minin rejected the advice and\npreferred the commandments of religious law over worldly expediency,\nand openly declared about Mu`awiyah as follows:"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIf I allow Mu`awiyah to retain what he already has I would be one\n\"who taketh those who lead (people) astray, as helpers\" (Qur'an,\n18:51).

They support anyone\nwhom they see succeeding by means of cunning ways and deceitful\nmeans and begin to regard him an administrator, intelligent, a\npolitician, intellectually brilliant and so on, while he who does\nnot deploy cunning and fraudulent methods owing to his adherence to\nIslamic commandments and divine instructions and prefers failure to\nsuccess secured through wrong methods is regarded as ignorant of\npolitics and weak in foresight.
