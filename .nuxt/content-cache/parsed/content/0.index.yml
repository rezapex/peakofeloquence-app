Tahera Qutbuddin presents in this volume a painstaking new edition of this monument of Arabic literature, based on the oldest and most reliable manuscripts and thorough consideration of the commentarial tradition. Her brilliant translation is faithful to the original text, precise, and elegant, capturing the force of pithy aphorisms, the cadence of Arabic oratory, and contemplative reflection on the trials and tribulations of human experience, the ethical quandaries of social and political life, and the wonders of the natural world.","author":{"name":"Devin J.

Dr. Qutbuddin has not only encapsulated the thoughts and ideas of Imam ʿAli accurately, but she has also beautifully preserved the fluency, flow and tempo of Nahj al-Balāghah’s sermons and sayings in English through her selective choice of words and flowing structure. I strongly recommend this translation to the specialist and casual reader alike.","author":{"name":"Syed Muhammad Rizvi","description":"Principal Director, Shiʿa Research Institute, Toronto, and Head, Council of Shiʿa Muslim Scholars of North America","avatar":{"src":null,"loading":"lazy"}}},{"quote":"Few works in Arabic contain the depth of wisdom and eloquence found in Nahj al-Balāghah, the fourth-century AH collection of the statements of Imam ʿAli b.

We live in a challenging age and a difficult time ...”. This is one of the many statements that still ring true, and it is not surprising that Nahj al-Balāghah (The Way of Eloquence) has remained one of the most revered Arabic texts among both Sunni and Shiʿi Muslims. These speeches, letters, and sayings attributed to ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib, cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muḥammad, one of the key figures in Islamic history and considered an outstanding orator, were compiled around CE 1000. This volume, with Tahera Qutbuddin’s splendid scholarly edition and masterly translation, is a major achievement.","author":{"name":"Geert Jan van Gelder","description":"Laudian Professor of Arabic Emeritus, University of Oxford","avatar":{"src":null,"loading":"lazy"}}},{"quote":"From the second I opened the first Sermon, i was immediately entranced and found myself standing in awe of the wisdom and eloquence of Imam Ali.
