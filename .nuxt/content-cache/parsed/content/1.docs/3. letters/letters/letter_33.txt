Therefore we hold two \nexcellences: That of close relationship to the Holy Prophet (s) and that of loyally accepting \nhis teachings. Do you know on the day of Saqifa, Muhajirs told Ansar that they were superior \nto them because they in one way or the other, were related to the Holy Prophet (s) and \ntherefore they deserved the caliphate and with the aid of this argument the Muhajirs carried \nthe day. \nIf success can be achieved with the help of this argument and if it has got a grain of truth in it \nthen according it, we and not you, deserve the caliphate. If not, then the Ansar still hold their \nclaim over the caliphate. \nYou want to impress the world with the idea that I envied all the previous caliphs and that I \nwas jealous of them. Even if I grant this, I want to know what right and authority have you to \nask for an explanation from me? You have no place in religion to talk of such things. You \nalso want to taunt me by saying that when I refused to accept the caliphate of the First Caliph \nI was dragged like a camel with a rope round my neck and every kind of cruelty and \nhumiliation was leveled against me. I swear by my life that by talking like that you want to \nbring disgrace to me but you are actually doing the greatest service to me and are disgracing \nyourself as well as the cause that you pretend to support. \nThere is no disgrace for a Muslim if he is subjected to tyranny and suppression so long as he \nis firm in his faith and belief in Allah and religion. This is exactly what I say that every \ncruelty and tyranny was leveled against me to deprive me of the right which Allah and the \nHoly Prophet (s) have given me and this is exactly what you do not want to acknowledge and \naccept. Your taunts against me go a long way to prove that in reality there was no election, it \nwas a coup d'etat followed by brutal force which decided the fate of caliphate by making it \nneither hereditary nor elective but possessive. I have no desire to go into these details but you \nbrought in the subject and I was forced to explain a few points about it. \nThen you have referred to the murder of Uthman, and declaring yourself to be his relative, \nyou claim vengeance and blood (and want me to arrange for it as if I was responsible for the \nmurder). I want to say something about the insinuation and false propaganda carried on by \nyou in this respect. \nMy reply to you is that first of all you should try and find out who was the arch-enemy of \nUthman. Can the arch-enemy be he who offered his help and services to Uthman and Uthman \nrefused to have anything to do with him and told him plainly to go and sit at home as his help \nwas not required and his services were not needed or the worst enemy of Uthman is he whom \nUthman asked to come to his succour and who purposely and intentionally delayed the help \nand allowed the events to take their course till what was to happen. No, these two persons \ncannot be considered in the same category. I swear by the Omniscient Allah that He very well \nknows everything as He says in the Holy Book, \"Allah certainly knows the people who put \nobstacles in the path of those who wanted to go to war and also to those who did not stay to \nface a battle.\""},"hash":"BoEKQ8znUw"}
