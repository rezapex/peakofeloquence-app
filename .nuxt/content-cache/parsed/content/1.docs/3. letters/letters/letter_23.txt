{"parsed":{"_id":"content:1.docs:3. letters:letters:letter_23.txt","body":"[ The following is a letter from Imam Ali (a) to Ziyad who was appointed as the \nCommissioner of Basra by Abdullah bin Abbas, the Governor of the provinces of Ahwaz, \nBasra, Kirman and Fars. Ziyad was from the very beginning dishonest and corrupt, a man \nwho would not stop short at any vice or sin to gain his end. He had come from a very low \nfamily so much so that nobody knew his father's name; his mother was a harlot. Ummul \nMu'minin Aisha had nicknamed him as \"His father's son\" and he was known all over Arabia \nby this insulting name. \nBut he was a self-made man, a great conspirator. Ibn Abbas had found him a useful officer as \nhe could suppress any voice raised against his government. He appointed him as a \ncommissioner and had recommended him to Imam Ali (a). Imam Ali (a) also gave him a \nchance and wanted to see whether he could give up his bad ways. But he did not change his \nbehaviour, so Imam Ali (a) dismissed him. \nLater on Mu'awiya in his court declared him to be his father's (Abu Sufyaan's) illegitimate \nson. Ziyad was glad that atleast he could name some big man - though thirty years after the \ndeath of that man - to be his father, and thus became a staunch friend of Mu'awiya - his socalled \nhalf brother. Imam Ali (a) wrote this letter to Ziyad when he was still the \nCommissioner of Basra. ]I swear by Allah that if I find you misappropriating the wealth of Muslims I will punish you \nin such a way that you will be left poor. Besides this poverty there will be the burden of sins \non your shoulders, you will be disgraced and humiliated, losing your position and prestige."},"hash":"BFphBfQCCe"}
