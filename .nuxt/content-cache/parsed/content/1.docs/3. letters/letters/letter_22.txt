It shows how Imam Ali (a) was training the Muslims to behave tolerantly towards other \nreligions, how minority was to be treated and what should those who hold a different creed, \nexpect of a Muslim ruler. ]After invoking Allah and praising the Holy Prophet (s) be it known to you that villagers and \nfarmers of the provinces under you, complain of your harshness, arrogance and cruelty. They \ncomplain that you consider them mean, humble and insignificant and treat them scornfully. I \ndeliberated over their complaint and found that if, on account of their paganism they do not \ndeserve any favourable treatment of extra privileges, they do not deserve to be treated cruelly \nand harshly either. They are governed by us, they have made certain agreements with us and \nwe are obliged to respect and honour the terms of those agreements. \nTherefore, be kind to them in future, tolerate them and give them due respect, but at the same \ntime keep your prestige and guard well the position and honour of the authority which you \nhold. Always govern with a soft but strong hand. Treat them as they individually deserve, \nkindly or harshly and with respect or with contempt."},"hash":"ET1oNDyXHR"}
