Remember that you have to meet Him one day \n(let the fear of Allah guide you in all your activities against man) and your end will be \ntowards Him and towards none else. \nDo not fight against anybody unless he wishes to fight against you. During winters travel in \nthe mornings and give your army a rest in the afternoons. Do rush through journeys (unless \nabsolutely necessary). Travel by easy stages, and do not tire out your army during the \njourney. Do not travel during the early part of the evening because Allah has meant this to be \ntime for rest and comfort and not for march and exertion, make use of these hours to give rest \nto your body and mind. \nWhen you have rested then begin your march with trust and faith in Allah in the early hours \nof the morning. \nWhen you face your enemy, stand in the midst of your army, never alone. Do not be overanxious \nto fight and do not behave as if you craving for a combat or aspiring for an encounter, \nbut at the same time do not try to avoid your enemy or to evade an engagement as if you are \nafraid or nervous. Keep my orders in mind and act accordingly until you get further \ninstructions. Do not let the hatred and enmity of your opponents force you to a combat, do not \nbegin a battle even if the enemy so desires unless you have explored every avenue of amity \nand good-will and have exhausted all the chances of a peaceful settlement."},"hash":"9QVy0SenhV"}
