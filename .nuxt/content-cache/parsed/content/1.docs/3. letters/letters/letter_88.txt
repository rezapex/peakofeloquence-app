Imam Ali (a) wrote to him the following letter in reply. \nSayyid bin Yahya Amawi has quoted this letter in his book Al-Maghazi. ]Verily there are many people in this world who have forsaken their salvation and in its place \nthey have accepted the pomp and pleasure of worldly life. They are being driven by their \nunruly and inordinate desires and they work and speak on behalf of these desires only. \nThis affair has placed me in an awkward position. The people, who have united against me \nare those who want everything out of this vicious and wicked world for themselves and for \ntheir pleasures. They have drawn their swords against me. I am trying to undo the harm they \nhave done but I am afraid lest the problem should become very serious and unresolvable. \nYou know very well that no one is more desirous of the Unity of Muslims than I and the only \nthing which I want to achieve by this unity is the Blessings of Allah and my salvation. I shall \ndo what I have resolved to do even though you change the good opinion which you had about \nme when we last parted. Surely, unfortunate is he who possesses wisdom and acquires \nexperience and yet does not care to make use of either. \nI cannot tolerate lies and I cannot bear to see people undoing the good done by Allah through \nIslam. \nTherefore you should give up forming opinion about things which you have not clearly \nunderstood or visualized because many people will try their best to influence you with their \ninsinuations."},"hash":"ExsS673xzh"}
