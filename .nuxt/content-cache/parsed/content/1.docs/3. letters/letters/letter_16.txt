Our hearts seek Your Protection, our faces turn to You, our eyes look towards You, \nour feet move towards Your path and our bodies sincerely submit to Your command. O Lord! \nHidden hostilities and concealed spite are exposed, hearts are boiling over with envy and \nmalice. O Lord! We place before You our difficulties, the absence of the Holy Prophet (s) \nfrom amongst us, the abundance of enemies, the disappointments and frustrations which face \nus. O Lord! Let truth prevail and let our people realize justice, honesty and piety of our case."},"hash":"UIou97ESir"}
