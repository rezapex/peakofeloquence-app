And when a worldly-minded person grasp a little of it, it always opens before him \nvistas of false hopes, ambitions, temptations and greed, so that he is never satisfied with what \nhe has grabbed and will always covet for more. The result often is that he loses what he has \nalready amassed and his plans do not work out. If you take a lesson from the past then you \ncan guard your future very well."},"hash":"NnqD2q3972"}
