{"parsed":{"_id":"content:1.docs:3. letters:letters:letter_21.txt","body":"[When Abdullah bin Abbas was the Governor of Basra, Imam Ali (a) wrote the following \nletter to him. The cause of this letter was the behaviour of Ibn Abbas towards the clan of Bani \nTamim. Ibn Abbas hated them because some of them had sided with Talha and Zubayr in the \nBattle of Jamal and therefore, he had on occasions treated them scornfully. They reported this \nmatter to Imam Ali (a) requesting that the whole clan should not be treated badly because of \nthe folly of a few. This letter shows what a kind rule it was that Imam Ali (a) wanted to \nintroduce. ]Understand very well Ibn Abbas that Basra is a satanic place. It is an abode of strifes and \nbloodshed. So be kind and tolerant towards the citizens of Basra. Win them over with \nkindness, sympathy and sincerity. Remove fear, suspicion, distrust and animosity from their \nminds. I am given to understand that you have ill-treated the clan of Bani Tamim and have \ninsulted them. \nRemember that Bani Tamim is such a clan that their star has not set as yet, amongst them if \none great man dies there is another to take his place. Remember that after embracing Islam \nand even during pre-Islamic days these people were never regarded as mean, jealous or \ncovetous. On the contrary, they had a very high status. Besides they have claims of kinship \nand friendship with us. If we behave kindly, patiently and sympathetically towards them \nAllah will reward us. But if we ill-treat them we shall be sinning. \nMay Allah have mercy upon you, Ibn Abbas! Be careful about your behaviour towards those \nover whom you are ruling, be kind to all and be careful about your tongue and your behaviour \nbecause you are ruling there on my behalf and your actions are those of mine and I am \nresponsible for them. I have a good opinion about you, please try to be such that I may not be \nforced to change it."},"hash":"u4uyl1rRp2"}
