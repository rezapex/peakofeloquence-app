And there were those who excelled even Kharijites in\nholding and calling Amir al-mu'minin bad. So those who are\nthemselves in the wrong have no right to fight others in the wrong.\nAgain, those who are wilfully in the wrong can be allowed to fight\nthose who are in the wrong by mistake. Thus, Amir al-mu'minin's\nwords make this fact clear that the misguidance of Kharijites was\nnot wilful but under Satan's influence. They mistook wrong as right\nand stuck to it. On the other hand, the position of misguidance of\nMu`awiyah and his party was that they rejected right realising it\nas right and appropriated wrong as the code of their conduct fully\nknowing that it was wrong. Their audacity in the matter of religion\nreached the stage that it can neither be regarded as a result of\nmisunderstanding nor can it be covered under the garb of error of\njudgement, because they openly transgressed the limits of religion\nand paid no heed to the Prophet's injunctions in comparison with\ntheir own view. Thus, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written (vol. 5, p. 130)\nthat when the Prophet's companion Abu'd-Darda' saw utensils of\ngold and silver being used by Mu`awiyah he said he had heard the\nProphet saying, \"One who drinks in vessels of gold and silver will\nfeel flames of the fire of Hell in his stomach\" whereupon\nMu`awiyah said, \"As for me, l do not find any harm in it.\"\nSimilarly, creating Ziyad ibn Abih's blood relationship with\nhimself by his own opinion in total disregard of the Prophet's\ninjunction, abusing the descendants of the Prophet over the pulpit,\ntransgressing the limits of shari`ah, shedding blood of innocent\npersons and placing over Muslims (as so called Khalifah) a vicious\nindividual and thus opening the way to disbelief and atheism are\nevents that to attribute them to any misunderstanding is like\nwilfully closing eyes to facts.]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-61","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 61"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons_clean:61.
