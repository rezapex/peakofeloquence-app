For\nexample, when `Ubaydullah ibn `Abdillah ibn `Utbah mentioned to\n`Abdullah ibn `Abbas the narration by `A'ishah namely that \"in\nhis death-illness the Prophet, taking support on al-Fadl ibn `Abbas\nand another person, came to her (`A'ishah's) house,\" `Abdullah\nibn `Abbas said: \"Do you know who this 'other man' was?\" He\nsaid, \"No.\" Then he said, ' \"`Ali ibn Abi Talib, but she is\naverse to name him in a good context.\" (Ahmad ibn Hanbal,\nal-Musnad, vol. 6, pp. 34, 228; Ibn Sa`d, at-Tabaqat al-Kabir, vol.\n2, part 2, p. 29; at-Tabari, at-Tarikh, vol. 1, pp. 1800-1801;\nal-Baladhuri, Ansab al-ashraf, vol. 1, pp. 544-545; al-Bayhaqi,\nas-Sunan al-kubra, vol. 3, p. 396)."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nOne cause for this hatred and malice was the presence of Hadrat\nFatimah (p.b.u.h.) whose wholesome dignity and esteem pricked her\nheart like a thorn.

All these things pained her much and\nnaturally her feelings on such an occasion were that if she had\nborne children they would have been the Prophet's sons and they\nwould have been the pivot of the Prophet's affection instead of\nImam Hasan and Imam Husayn. But she was not gifted with any issue\nand she gratified her own desire to be a mother by adopting the\nsurname Umm `Abdillah (mother of the slave of Allah) after her\nsister's son. In short all these things created the passion of\nhatred in her heart, as a result of which she off and on complained\nto the Prophet against Hadrat Fatimah but could not succeed in\ndiverting the Prophet's attention from her."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNews about this mortification and estrangement also reached the ears\nof Abu Bakr.

At last\nthe Prophet left this world and the reins of Government fell into\nhis hands. Now was the opportunity for him to avenge as best as he\ncould and to perpetrate whatever violence he had in mind.\nConsequently the first step he took was that, in order to deprive\nHadrat Fatimah of inheritance, he denied the principle of\ninheritance in the case of the prophets and held that neither do the\nprophets inherit nor are they inherited from, but the property left\nby them escheats to the state. Fatimah was so much affected that she\ngave up speaking to him and passed away from this world with these\nvery feelings. `A'ishah did not even take the trouble to express\nany sorrow at her tragic death.

There were\nalso moments when distinction was conferred on Amir al-mu'minin in\npreference to Abu Bakr. For instance, in connection with the\ndispatch of the Qur'anic verses on Bara'ah (innocence), the\nProphet removed Abu Bakr from the job, recalled him and assigned it\nto Amir al-mu'minin saying that he had been commanded by Allah to\ntake it himself or send it through a member of his family. Similarly\nthe Prophet closed all the doors opening into the mosque including\nthat of Abu Bakr but allowed the door of Amir al-mu'minin's house\nto continue to open thereinto."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n`A'ishah could not relish Amir al-mu'minin's distinction over\nher father, and whenever there was any occasion for such distinction\nshe did her best to undo it. When in his last days the Prophet\nordered the contingent under Usamah ibn Zayd to march, and ordered\nAbu Bakr and `Umar also to go under his command, they received a\nmessage from the wives of the Prophet that his condition was serious\nand therefore the contingent should come back instead of proceeding\nfurther. This was because their far-reaching sight had realised that\nthe only purpose in getting Medina vacated by the muhajirun and the\nansar could be that after the death of the Prophet no one should\nstand in Amir al-mu'minin's way and that he should get the\ncaliphate without any trouble. On receipt of this message the\ncontingent under Usamah came back. When the Prophet learnt this he\nagain ordered Usamah to march with the contingent and even said,\n\"Allah may curse him who keeps away from the contingent,\"\nwhereupon they again set off, but they were again called back till\nthe Prophet's illness assumed serious proportions, but Usamah's\ncontingent did not go out as it did not want to. After this Abu Bakr\nwas sent word through Bilal that he should deputise the Prophet in\nleading the prayers in order to pave the way for his Caliphateship.\nAccordingly, keeping this in view he was first shown as the\nProphet's caliph (deputy) in prayers and eventually was accepted as\nhis caliph for all purposes. Thereafter matters were so contrived\nthat Amir al-mu'minin could not get the Caliphate. However, after\nthe reign of the third caliph circumstances took such a turn that\npeople were obliged to swear allegiance at Amir al-mu'minin's\nhand. On this occasion `A'ishah was present in Mecca. When she\nlearnt about Amir al-mu'minin's caliphate her eyes began emitting\nflames, and rage and anger perturbed her mind, and her hatred for\nAmir al-mu'minin assumed such seriousness that she rose against him\non the excuse of avenging blood of the same man (`Uthman) whom she\nhad herself proclaimed fit to be killed, and openly declared war as\na result of which so much bloodshed occurred that the whole land of\nBasrah was smeared with the blood of those killed, and the door of\ndisunity was opened for good.
