Therefore, if some\nevents become known to some people in wakefulness why should there\nbe amazement over it and what are the grounds for rejecting it, when\nit stands to reason that things possible in dreams are also possible\nin wakefulness. Thus, Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani has written that it is\npossible to achieve all this, because in a dream the spirit becomes\nfree from looking after the body and is removed from bodily\nconnections; as a result of this it perceives such hidden realities\nwhich could not be seen because of the obstruction of the body. In\nthe same way those perfect beings who pay no heed to bodily matters,\nand turn with all the attention of spirit and heart towards the\ncentre of knowledge can see those realities and secrets which the\nordinary eyes are unable to discern. Therefore, keeping in view the\nspiritual greatness of Ahlul Bayt (members of the Prophet's family)\nit should not appear strange that they were aware of events which\nwere going to occur in future. Ibn Khaldun has written:"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n\"When thaumaturgic feats are performed by others what do you think\nabout those who were distinguished in knowledge and honesty and were\na mirror of the Prophet's traits, while the consideration Allah had\nfor their noble root (namely the Prophet) is a proof of the high\nperformances of his chaste off-shoots (Ahlul Bayt).

Of course, those whose knowledge does not extend\nbeyond the limits of physical objectivity and whose means of\nlearning are confined to the bodily senses refuse to believe in the\nknowledge about the paths of divine cognisance and reality. If this\nkind of claim were unique and were heard only from over Amir\nal-mu'minin then minds could have wavered and temperaments could\nhave hesitated in accepting it, but if the Qur'an records even such\na claim of `Isa (Jesus) that - \"I can tell you what you eat or\ndrink or store in your houses,\" then why should there be hesitation\nover Amir al-mu'minin's claim, when it is agreed that Amir\nal-mu'minin had succeeded to all the attainments and distinctions\nof the Prophet and it cannot be contended that the Prophet did not\nknow what `Isa (Jesus) knew. Thus, if the successor of the Prophet\nadvances such a claim, why should it be rejected, particularly as\nthis vastness of knowledge of Amir al-mu'minin is the best evidence\nand proof for the Prophet's knowledge and perfection and a living\nmiracle of his truthfulness."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIn this connection, it is amazing that even having knowledge of\nevents Amir al-mu'minin did not, through any of his words or deeds,\nindicate that he knew them.

The reply to this\nis that the commands of the shari`ah are based on apparent\nconditions. Otherwise secret knowledge is a kind of miracle and\npower which Allah grants to His prophets and Imams. Although the\nprophets and Imams possess this power always, they cannot make use\nof it at any time unless and until by the permission of Allah and on\nthe proper occasion. For example, the verse quoted above about `Isa\n(Jesus) which tells that he had the power to give life, to heal the\nblind and declare what one ate and stored in his house, etc., he\n(Jesus) did not used to practise this power on every thing or every\ncorpse or everyone who met him.

For example, if a prophet or divine, on\nthe basis of his secret knowledge, punishes a condemnable man by\nkilling him, there would be great commotion and agitation among\nthose who see it on the ground that he killed an innocent man. That\nis why Allah has not permitted the basing of conclusions on secret\nknowledge save in a few special cases, and has enjoined the\nfollowing of observable factors. Thus, despite his being aware of\nthe hypocrisy of some of the hypocrites, the Prophet extended to\nthem the treatment that should be extended to a Muslim."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNow, there can be no scope for the objection that if Amir\nal-mu'minin knew secret matters then why did he not act according\nto them because it has been shown that he was not obliged to act\naccording to the requirements of his secret knowledge. Of course,\nwhere conditions so required he did disclose some matters for the\npurposes of preaching, admonishing, giving good tidings (of reward)\nor warning (against punishment), so that future events could be\nfore-closed. For example, Imam Ja`far as-Sadiq (p.b.u.h.) informed\nYahya ibn Zayd that if he went out he would be killed. Ibn Khaldun\nwrites in this connection: \"It has been authentically related from\nImam Ja`far as-Sadiq that he used to apprise some of his relations\nof the events to befall them. For example, he warned his cousin\nYahya ibn Zayd of being killed but he disobeyed him and went out and\nwas killed in Juzajan.\" (al-Muqaddamah, p. 233)."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nNevertheless, where there was apprehension that minds would get\nworried it was not at all disclosed.
