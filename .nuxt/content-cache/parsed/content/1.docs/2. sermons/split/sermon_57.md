Then a second and third time a man was sent to call him but\nhe brought the same news. Thereupon the Prophet said , \"May Allah\nnever satisfy his belly.\" The effect of this curse was that when he\nfelt tired of eating he would say , \"Take away, for, by Allah I am\nnot satiated but I am tired and disgusted.\" Similarly, his abusing\nAmir al-mu'minin and ordering his officers for it are such accepted\nfacts of history about which there is no scope of denying. In this\nconnection such words were used on the pulpit that even Allah and\nthe Prophet were hit by them. Thus, Umm al-mu'minin Umm Salamah\nwrote to Mu`awiyah, \"Certainly you people abuse Allah and the\nProphet, and this is like this that you hurl abuses on `Ali and\nthose who love him, while I do stand witness that Allah and the\nProphet did love him.\" (al-`Iqd al-Farid, Vol. 3, p. 131)"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThanks to `Umar ibn `Abdil-`Aziz who put a stop to it, and\nintroduced the following verse in place of abuse in the sermons:\nVerily Allah enjoineth justice and benevolence (to others) and\ngiving unto the kindred, and forbidden lewdness, and evil, and\nrebellion; He exhorteth you that ye may take heed (Qur'an 16:90)"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIn this sermon Amir al-mu'minin has ordered his killing on the\nbasis of the Prophet's order that \"When you (O' Muslims) see\nMu`awiyah on my pulpit, kill him.\" (Kitab Siffin, pp. 243, 248;\nSharh of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid, Vol. 1, p.348; Ta'rikh Baghdad, Vol.\n12, p. 181; Mizan al-I`tidal, Vol. 2, p. 128; Tahdhib at-tahdhib,\nVol. 2, p. 428; Vol. 5, p. 110; Vol. 7, p.\n324)]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-57","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 57"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:split:sermon_57.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/split/sermon_57.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"cydlFK19L5"}
