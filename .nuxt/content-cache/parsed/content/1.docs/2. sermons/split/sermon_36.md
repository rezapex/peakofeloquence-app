But\nthe Kharijites gave him this reply, \"When you had agreed to\nArbitration in our view you had turned heretic. Now if you admit\nyour heresy and offer repentance we will think over this matter and\ndecide what we should do.\" Amir al-mu'minin understood from their\nreply that their disobedience and misguidance had become very\nserious. To entertain any kind of hope from them now was futile.\nConsequently, ignoring them he encamped in the valley of\nan-Nukhaylah with a view to marching towards Syria. When the army\nhad been arrayed he came to know that the men desired to deal with\nthe people of Nahrawan first, and to move towards Syria afterwards.\nAmir al-mu'minin, however, said that they should be left as they\nwere, that they themselves should first move towards Syria while the\npeople of Nahrawan could be dealt with afterwards. People said that\nthey were prepared to obey every order of his with all their might\nwhether he moved this way or that way. The army had not moved when\nnews about the rebellion of Kharijites began to reach, and it was\nlearnt that they had butchered the governor of Nahrawan namely\n`Abdullah ibn Khabbab ibn al-Aratt and his slave maid with the\nchild in her womb, and have killed three women of Banu Tayyi and Umm\nSinan as-Saydawiyyah. Amir al-mu'minin sent al-Harith ibn Murrah\nal-`Abdi for investigation but he too was killed by them. When\ntheir rebellion reached this stage it was necessary to deal with\nthem. Consequently, the army turned towards Nahrawan. On reaching\nthere Amir al-mu'minin sent them word that those who had killed\n`Abdullah ibn Khabbab ibn al-Aratt and innocent women should be\nhanded over to him for avenging blood. Those people replied that\nthey had killed these persons jointly and that they considered it\nlawful to shed the blood of all the people on his side. Even at this\nAmir al-mu'minin did not take the initiative for the battle, but\nsent Abu Ayyub al-Ansari with a message of peace. So he spoke to\nthem aloud, \"Whoever comes under this banner or separates from that\nparty and goes to Kufah or al-Mada'in would get amnesty and he\nwould not be questioned. As a result of this Farwah ibn Nawfal\nal-Ashja'i said that he did not know why they were at war with Amir\nal-mu'minin. Saying this he separated along with five hundred men.\nSimilarly group after group began to separate and some of them\njoined Amir al-mu'minin. Those who remained numbered four thousand,\nand according to at-Tabari's account they numbered two thousand\neight hundred. These people were not in any way prepared to listen\nto the voice of truth, and were ready to kill or be killed. Amir\nal-mu'minin had stopped his men to take the initiative but the\nKharijites put arrows in their bows and broke and threw away the\nsheathes of their swords. Even at this juncture Amir al-mu'minin\nwarned them of the dire consequences of war and this sermon is about\nthat warning and admonition. But they were so brimming with\nenthusiasm that they leapt on Amir al-mu'minin's force all of a\nsudden. This onslaught was so severe that the foot men lost ground\nbut they soon fixed themselves firmly that the attack of arrows and\nspears could not dislodge them from their position and they soon so\ncleared away the Kharijites that except for nine persons who fled\naway to save their lives not a single person was left alive. From\nAmir al-mu'minin's army only eight persons fell as martyrs. The\nbattle took place on the 9th Safar, 38\nA.H.]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-36","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 36"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:split:sermon_36.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/split/sermon_36.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"3mWfpxyySr"}
