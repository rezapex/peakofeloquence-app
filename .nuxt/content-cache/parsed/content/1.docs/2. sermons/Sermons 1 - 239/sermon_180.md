He is\nnear to things but not (physically) contiguous. He is far from them but not (physically)\nseparate. He is a speaker, but not with reflection. He intends, but not with preparation. He\nmoulds, but not with (the assistance of) limbs.\nHe is subtle but cannot be attributed with being concealed. He is great but cannot be attributed\nwith haughtiness. He sees but cannot be attributed with the sense (of sight).\nHe is Merciful but cannot be attributed with weakness of heart. Faces feel low before His\ngreatness and hearts tremble out of fear of Him."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_180.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_180.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"JBKE8hcTiD"}
