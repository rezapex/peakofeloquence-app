By Allah, you would find it like a long shade upto\na fixed time.\nSo the earth is with you without let or hindrance and your hands in it are extended while the\nhands of the leaders are held away from you. Your swords are hanging over them while their\nswords are held away from you.\nBeware that for every blood (that is shed) there is an avenger and for every right there is a\nclaimant. The avenger for our blood is like the judge for his own claim, and it is Allah who is\nsuch that if one seeks Him, then He does not disappoint him, and one who runs away from\nHim cannot escape Him.\nI swear by Allah, O' Banu Umayyah, shortly you will see it (i.e. your possession) in the hands\nof others and in the house of your enemy. Know that the best looking eye is that whose sight\ncatches virtue and know that the best hearing ear is that which hears good advice and accepts\nit.\nAbout the functions of the Imams\nO' people, secure light from the flame of lamps of the preacher who follows what he preaches\nand draw water from the spring which has been cleaned of dirt.\nO' creatures of Allah, do not rely on your ignorance, do not be obedient to your desires,\nbecause he who stays at this place is like one who stays on the brink of a bank undermined by\nwater carrying ruin on his back from one portion to the other following his opinion which he\nchanges (one after the other). He wants to make adhere what cannot adhere and to bring\ntogether what cannot keep together.\nSo fear Allah and do not place your complaints before him who cannot redress your\ngrievance, nor undo with his opinion what has been made obligatory for you.\nCertainly, there is no obligation on the Imam except what has been devolved on him from\nAllah, namely to convey warnings, to exert in good advice, to revive the sunnah, to enforce\npenalties on those liable to them and to issue shares to the deserving.\nSo hasten towards knowledge before its vegetation dries up and before you turn yourselves\naway from seeking knowledge from those who have it. Desist others from the unlawful and\nabstain from it yourself, because you have been commanded to abstain (yourself) before\nabstaining (others)."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_106.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_106.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"kNCA2FMQjM"}
