The Qur'an is\na book, covered, between two flaps, and it does not speak. It should therefore necessarily have\nan interpreter. Men alone can be such interpreters.\nWhen these people invited us to name the Qur'an as the arbitrator between us, we could not be\nthe party turning away from the Book of Allah. since Allah has said:\n. . . And then if ye quarrel about anything refer it to Allah and the Prophet . . (Qur'an, 4:59)\nReference to Allah means that we decide according to the Qur'an while reference to the\nProphet means that we follow his Sunnah. Now therefore, if arbitration were truly done\nthrough the Book of Allah (Qur'an). we would be the most rightful of all people for the\nCaliphate; or if it were done by the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), we would be the\nmost preferable of them.\nConcerning your point why I allowed a time lag between myself and them with regard to the\nArbitration, I did so in order that the ignorant may find out (the truth) and one who already\nknows may hold with it firmly.\nPossibly Allah may, as a result of this peace, improve the condition of these people, and they\nwill not be caught by the throats and will not, before indication of the right, fall into rebellion\nas before. Certainly the best man before Allah is he who loves most to act according to right,\neven though it causes him hardship and grief rather than according to wrong, even though it\ngives him benefit and increase.\nSo, where are you being misled and from where have you been brought (to this state)? Be\nprepared to march to the people who have deviated from the right and do not see it, have been\nentangled in wrong-doing and are not corrected.\nThey are away from the Book and turned from the (right) path. You are not trustworthy to\nrely upon, nor are you holders of honour to be adhered to. You are very bad in kindling the\nfire of fighting.\nWoe to you! I had to bear a lot of worries from you. Some day I call you (to jihad) and some\nday I speak to you in confidence, you are neither true free men at the time of call, nor\ntrustworthy brothers at the time of speaking in confidence."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_126.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_126.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"98nV8GCMt0"}
