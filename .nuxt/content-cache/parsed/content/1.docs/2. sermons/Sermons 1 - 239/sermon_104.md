By Allah, it\nwould shortly turn out its inhabitants and cause grief to the happy and the safe.\nThat which turns and goes away from it never returns and that which is likely to come about\nis not known or anticipated. Its joy is mingled with grief. Herein men's firmness inclines\ntowards weakness and languidness. The majority of what pleases you here should not mislead\nyou because that which would help you would be little.\nAllah may shower His mercy on him who ponders and takes lesson thereby, and when he\ntakes lesson he achieves enlightenment. Whatever is present in this world would shortly not\nexist, while whatever is to exist in the next world is already in existence.\nEvery countable thing would pass away. Every anticipation should be taken to be coming up\nand every thing that is to come up should be taken as just near.\nA part of the same sermon on the attributes of a learned person\nLearned is he who knows his worth. It is enough for a man to remain ignorant if he knows not\nhis worth. Certainly, the most hated man with Allah is he whom Allah has left for his own\nself. He goes astray from the right path, and moves without a guide. If he is called to the\nplantation of this world he is active, but if he is called to the plantation of the next world he is\nslow.\nAs though what he is active for is obligatory upon him whereas in whatever he is slow was\nnot required of him.\nA part of the same sermon concerning future times\nThere would be a time wherein only a sleeping (inactive) believer would be safe (such that) if\nhe is present he is not recognised but if he is absent he is not sought after. These are the lamps\nof guidance and banners of night journeys. They do not spread calumnies nor divulge secrets,\nnor slander.\nThey are those for whom Allah would open the doors of His mercy and keeps off from them\nthe hardships of His chastisement.\nO' people ! a time will come to you when Islam would be capsized as a pot is capsized with\nall its contents. O' people, Allah has protected you from that He might be hard on you but He\nhas not spared you from being put on trial. Allah the Sublimest of all speakers has said:\nVerily in this are signs and We do only try (the people). (Qur'an, 23:30)\nas-Sayyid ar-Radi says: As regards Amir al-mu'minin's words \"kullu mu'minin\nnuwamah\" (every sleeping believer), he implies thereby one who is talked of little and causes\nno evil. And the word \"al-masayih\" is the plural of \"misyah\". He is one who spreads trouble\namong people through evils and calumnies.\nAnd the word \"al-madhayi\" is the plural of \"midhya\". He is one who on hearing of an evil\nabout some one spreads it and shouts about it. And \"al-budhur\" is the plural of \"badhur\". He\nis one who excels in foolishness and speaks rubbish."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_104.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_104.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"QWFUeZ0Oev"}
