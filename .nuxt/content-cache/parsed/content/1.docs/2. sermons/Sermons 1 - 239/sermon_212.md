Then He\nmade from it layers and separated them into seven skies after they had been joined together.\nSo, they became stationary at His command and stopped at the limit fixed by Him. He so\nmade the earth that it is born by deep blue, surrounded and suspended water which is obedient\nto His command and has submitted to His awe while its flow has stopped due to fear of Him.\nHe also created high hills, rocks of stones and lofty mountains. He put them in their positions\nand made them remain stationary. Their peaks rose into the air while their roots remained in\nthe water. In this way He raised the mountains above the plains and fixed their foundations in\nthe vast expanse wherever they stood.\nHe made their peaks high and made their bodies lofty. He made them like pillars for the earth\nand fixed them in it like pegs. Consequently, the earth became stationary; otherwise it might\nbend with its inhabitants or sink inwards with its burden, or shift from its positions.\nTherefore, glorified is He who stopped it after the flowing of its waters and solidified it after\nthe watery state of its sides. In this way He made it a cradle for His creatures and spread it for\nthem in the form of a floor over the deep ocean which is stationary and does not move and is\nfixed and does not flow. Severe winds move it here and there and clouds draw up water from\nit.\nVerily in this there is a lesson unto him who feareth (Allah) (Qur'an, 79:26)"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_212.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_212.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"puvijgYjVs"}
