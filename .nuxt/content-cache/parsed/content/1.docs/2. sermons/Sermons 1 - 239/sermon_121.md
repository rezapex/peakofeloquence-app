We the people of the house (of the Prophet - Ahlu'l-bayt) possess the doors\nof wisdom and light of governance. Beware that the paths of religion are one and its highways\nare straight.\nHe who follows them achieves (the aim) and secures (the objective). And he who stood away\nfrom it went astray and incurred repentance.\nDo act for the day for which provisions are stored, and when the intentions would be tested. If\na person's own intelligence which is present with him does not help him, the wits (of others)\nwhich are remote from him are more unhelpful and those which are away from him more\nuseless.\nDread the fire whose flame is severe, whose hollow is deep, whose dress is iron and whose\ndrink is bloody pus. Beware! The(1) good name of a man retained by Allah, the Sublime,\namong the people is better than wealth inherited by those who would not praise him.\n(1). If a person gives away something in his life time then the recipient feels obliged to him.\nBut if wealth is extracted by force then the extractor does not feel himself under his obligation,\nnor does he praise it.\nThe same is the case of one who dies. His successors think that whatever he had left behind\nwas their right and they should have received it. In this there is no obligation of his to be\nacknowledged.\nBut if he had done some good act with this very wealth his name would have remained behind\nhim and people would have praised him also. A Persian couplet says:\nHappy is he who is remembered well after himself, for nothing save the name\nremains after the man is dead."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_121.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_121.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"jF3gWWALSV"}
