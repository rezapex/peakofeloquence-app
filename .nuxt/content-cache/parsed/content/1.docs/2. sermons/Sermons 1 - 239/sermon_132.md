I am leading you (amicably) towards truthfulness, but you run away from it like goats\nand sheep running away from the howling of a lion. How hard it is for me to uncover for you\nthe secrets of justice, or to straighten the curve of truthfulness.\nO' my Allah! Thou knowest that what we did was not to seek power nor to acquire anything\nfrom the vanities of the world. We rather wanted to restore the signs of Thy religion and to\nusher prosperity into Thy cities so that the oppressed among Thy creatures might be safe and\nThy forsaken commands might be established. O' my Allah! I am the first who leaned\n(towards Thee) and who heard and responded (to the call of Islam). No one preceded me in\nprayer (salat) except the Prophet.\nYou certainly know that he who is in charge of honour, life, booty, (enforcement of) legal\ncommandments and the leadership of the Muslims should not be a miser as his greed would\naim at their wealth, nor be ignorant as he would then mislead them with his ignorance, nor be\nof rude behaviour who would estrange them with his rudeness, nor should he deal unjustly\nwith wealth thus preferring one group over another, nor should he accept a bribe while taking\ndecisions, as he would forfeit (others) rights and hold them up without finality, nor should he\nignore sunnah as he would ruin the people."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_132.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_132.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"oSTvdVn3cr"}
