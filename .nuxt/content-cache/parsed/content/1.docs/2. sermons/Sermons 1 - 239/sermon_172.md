Sustainer of the high sky and the suspended firmament which Thou hast made a\nshelter for the night and the day, an orbit for the sun and the moon and a path for the rotating\nstars, and for populating it Thou hast created a group of Thy angels who do not get weary of\nworshipping Thee.\nO' Sustainer of this earth which Thou hast made an abode for people and a place for the\nmovement of insects and beasts and countless other creatures seen and unseen. O' Sustainer of\nstrong mountains which Thou hast made as pegs for the earth and (a means of) support for\npeople.\nIf Thou givest us victory over our enemy, save us from excesses and keep us on the straight\npath of truth. But if Thou givest them victory over us, then grant us martyrdom and save us\nfrom mischief.\nWhere are those who protect honour, and those self-respecting persons who defend\nrespectable persons in the time of hardship? Shame is behind you while Paradise is in front of\nyou."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_172.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_172.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"ZFL8oL49Wj"}
