Beware, you should expect what is to befall you such as\nadversity in your affairs, severance of relations and the rising up of inferior people.\nThis will happen when the blow of a sword will be easier for a believer than to secure one\nDirham lawfully. This will happen (1) when the reward of the beggar is more than that of the\ngiver.\nThis will be when you are intoxicated, not by drinking, but with wealth and plenty, you are\nswearing without compulsion and are speaking lies without compulsion. This will be when\ntroubles hurt you as the saddle hurts the hump of the camel.\nHow long will these tribulations be and how distant the hope (for deliverance from them)?\nO' people, throw away the reins of the horses who carry on their backs the weight of your\nhands (i.e. sins), do not cut away from your chief (Imam) otherwise you will blame yourself\nfor your own doings. Do not jump in the fire which is in flames in front of you; keep away\nfrom its courses and leave the middle way for it. Because, by my life, the believer will die in\nits flames, and others will remain safe in it.\nI am among you like a lamp in the darkness. Whoever enters by it will be lit from it. So listen\nO' men, preserve it and remain attentive with the ears of your hearts so that you may\nunderstand.\n(1). In that period the reward of the beggar who takes will be higher than that of the giver\nbecause the ways of earning livelihood of the rich will be unlawful, and whatever he will donate\nof it, its purpose will be showing himself, hypocrisy and seeking fame, for which he will not be\nentitled to any reward, while the poor who take it by force of their poverty and helplessness,\nand to spend it in the right manner, will deserve more reward and recompense.\nThe commentator, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written another meaning of it also, namely if the beggar\ndoes not take the wealth from the rich and it remains with him he will spend it on unlawful\nmatters and enjoyments, and since his taking it from him prevents him from using it in\nunlawful manner; therefore, for this prevention of evil, the beggar will deserve more reward\nand recompense. (Sharh Nahj al-balaghah, vol. 13, p. 97)"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_188.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_188.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"cMr29iBr5T"}
