Amir al-mu'minin said:\nTheir falling place is on this side of the river. By Allah, not even ten of them will survive\nwhile from your side not even ten will be killed. (1)\nAs-Sayyid ar-Radi says: In this sermon \"nutfah\" implies the River Euphrates, and for water\nthis is the nicest expression, even though water may be much.\n(1). This prophecy cannot be attributed to wit and farsightedness, because farsighted eyes may\nforecast victory or defeat and preconceive the outcome of war but to tell about the correct\nfigures of the killed on either side is beyond their capacity.\nThis can be done only by one who can unveil the unknown future and see the coming scene\nwith his eyes and who sees the sketches yet to appear on the page of the future with the help\nof the light of knowledge possessed by him as Imam.\nConsequently, events occurred just according to what this inheritor of the Prophet's knowledge\nhad said, and from among the Kharijites all except nine persons were killed. Two of them fled\naway to `Uman, two to Sijistan, two to Kirman and two to al-Jazirah while one escaped to Tall\nMawzan. Of Amir al-mu'minin's party only eight men fell as martyrs."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_60.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_60.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"17YMKgqLfJ"}
