I had given you my orders\nabout this arbitration and put before you my hidden view, if Qasir's (2) orders were fulfilled\nbut you rejected it (my orders) like rough opponents and disobedient insurgents till the\ncounsellor himself fell in doubt about his counsel and the flint (of his wit) ceased to give\nflame.

The result was that some brainless\npersons raised hue and cry and created division and disturbance in the army and the efforts of\nsimple Muslims turned slow after having been near victory.\nWithout understanding anything they began to shout that they should prefer the verdict of the\nQur'an over war.\nWhen Amir al-mu'minin saw the Qur'an being the instrument of their activities, he said:\n\"O' people do not fall in this trap of deceit and trickery. They are putting up this device only to\nescape the ignominy of defeat.

He did not allow them to do so, and they compelled Amir al-mu'minin that he should send someone to call Malik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar from the battlefield. Being obliged, Amir al-mu'minin sent Yazid ibn Hani to call Malik back. When Malik heard this order he was bewildered and said, \"Please tell him this is not the occasion to leave the position. He may wait a bit then I will come to his audience with the tidings of victory.\" Hani conveyed this message on return but people shouted that Amir al-mu'minin must have sent word to him secretly to continue. Amir al-mu'minin said he never got any occasion to send any secret message to him. Whatever he said was said before them. People said he should be sent again and that if Malik delayed his return Amir al-mu'minin should forsake his life. Amir al-mu'minin again sent Yazid ibn Hani and sent word that rebellion had occurred, he should return in whatever condition he was. So Hani went and told Malik \"You hold victory dear or the life of Amir al-mu'minin. If his life is dear you should raise hands off the battle and go to him.\" Leaving the chances of victory Malik stood up and came to the audience of Amir al-mu'minin with grief and disappointment. Chaos raged there. He rebuked the people very much but matters had taken such a turn that could not be corrected.

Could these pages of history be made a torch-guide for the future and the Qur'an and sunnah be not used as a means of securing authority or as an instrument of worldly benefits. When Amir al-mu'minin got the news of this lamentable result of arbitration, he climbed on the pulpit and delivered this sermon every word of which savours of his grief and sorrow and at the same time it throws light on soundness of his thinking, correctness of his opinion and foresighted sagacity.

Jadhimah was more than puffed up at this proposal, and prepared himself to set off\nfor al-Jazirah with a thousand horsemen.\nHis slave Qasir advised him much that this was just a deceit and trick and that he should not\nplace himself in this danger; but his wit had been so blinded that he could not think over why\naz-Zabba' should select the Murderer of her father for her life companionship. Anyhow, he set\noff and when he reached the border of al-Jazirah although az-Zabba's army was present for his\nreception but she neither gave any special reception nor offered any warm welcome.\nSeeing this state Qasir was again suspicious and he advised Jadhimah to get back, but\nnearness to the goal had further fanned his passion. He paid no heed and stepping further\nentered the city. Soon on arrival there he was killed. When Qasir saw this he said, \"Had the\nadvice of Qasir been followed.\" From that time this proverb gained currency.\n(3). The poet of Hawazin implies Durayd ibn as-Simmah.
