But his sublimity does not put Him at a distance\nfrom anything of His creation, nor does His nearness bring them on equal level to Him.\nHe has not informed (human) wit about the limits of His qualities. Nevertheless, He has not\nprevented it from securing essential knowledge of Him. So he is such that all signs of\nexistence stand witness for Him till the denying mind also believes in Him. Allah is sublime\nbeyond what is described by those who liken Him to things or those who deny Him."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_51.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_51.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"49jdgzMee6"}
