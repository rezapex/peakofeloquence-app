You and whatever you desire from this world are like guests with fixed\nperiod of stay, and like debtors called upon to pay. Life is getting short while (the records of)\nactions are being preserved. Many strivers are wasting (their efforts) and many of those who\nexert are heading towards harm. You are in a period when steps of virtue are moving\nbackwards, steps of evil are moving forward and Satan is increasing his eagerness to ruin\npeople.\nThis is the time that his equipment is strong, his traps have been spread and his prey has\nbecome easy (to catch).\nCast your glance over people wherever you like, you will see either a poor man suffering\nfrom poverty, or a rich man ignoring Allah despite His bounty over him, or a miser increasing\nhis wealth by trampling on Allah's obligations, or an unruly person closing his ears to all\ncounsel.\nWhere are your good people; where are your virtuous people? Where are your high spirited\nmen and generous men? Where are those of you who avoid deceit in their business and\nremain pure in their behaviour? Have they not all departed from this ignoble, transitory and\ntroublesome world? Have you not been left among people who are just like rubbish and so\nlow that lips avoid mention of them and do not move even to condemn their low position.\n... \"Verily we are Allah's and verily unto Him shall we return.\" (Qur'an, 2:156)\nMischief has appeared and there is no one to oppose and change it, nor anyone to dissuade\nfrom it or desist from it. Do you, with these qualities, hope to secure abode in the purified\nneighbourhood of Allah and to be regarded His staunch lovers? Alas! Allah cannot be\ndeceived about His paradise and His will cannot be secured save by His obedience.\nAllah may curse those who advise good but they themselves avoid it, and those who desist\nothers from evil but they themselves act upon it."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_130.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_130.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"9tOmNfb193"}
