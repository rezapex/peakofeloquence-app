He has established such clear proofs for His delicate creative power and great\nmight that minds bend down to Him in acknowledgement thereof and in submission to Him,\nand arguments about His Oneness strike our ears.\nHe has created birds of various shapes which live in the burrows of the earth, in the openings\nof high passes and on the peaks of mountains.\nThey have different kinds of wings, and various characteristics. They are controlled by the\nrein of (Allah's) authority. They flutter with their wings in the expanse of the vast firmament\nand the open atmosphere.\nHe brought them into existence from non-existence in strange external shapes, and composed\nthem with joints and bones covered with flesh.\nHe prevented some of them from flying easily in the sky because of their heavy bodies and\nallowed them to use their wings only close to the ground. He has set them in different colours\nby his delicate might and exquisite creative power.\nAmong them are those which are tinted with one hue and there is no other hue except the one\nin which they have been dyed. There are others which are tinted with one colour, and they\nhave a neck ring of a different colour than that with which they are tinted.\nAbout the Peacock\nThe most amazing among them in its creation is the peacock, which Allah has created in the\nmost symmetrical dimensions, and arranged its hues in the best arrangement with wings\nwhose ends are inter-leaved together and whose tail is long.\nWhen it moves to its female it spreads out its folded tail and raises it up so as to cast a shade\nover its head, as if it were the sail of a boat being pulled by the sailor. It feels proud of its\ncolours and swaggers with its movements. It copulates like the cocks. It leaps (on the female)\nfor fecundation like lustful energetic men at the time of fighting.\nI am telling you all this from observation, unlike he who narrates on the basis of weak\nauthority, as for example, the belief of some people that it fecundates the female by a tear\nwhich flows from its eyes and when it stops on the edges of the eyelids the female swallows it\nand lays its eggs thereby and not through fecundation by a male other than by means of this\nflowing tear.\nEven if they say this, it would be no amazing than (what they say about) the mutual feeding of\nthe crows (for fecundation). You would imagine its feathers to be sticks made of silvers and\nthe wonderful circles and sun-shaped feathers growing thereon to be of pure gold and pieces\nof green emerald.\nIf you likened them to anything growing on land, you would say that it is a bouquet of flowers\ncollected during every spring. If you likened them to cloths, they would be like printed\napparels or amazing variegated cloths of Yemen. If you likened them to ornaments then they\nwould be like gems of different colour with studded silver.\nThe peacock walks with vanity and pride, and throws open its tail and wings and laughs\nadmiring the handsomeness of its dress and the hues of its necklace of gems.\nBut when it casts its glance at its legs it cries loudly with a voice which indicates its call for\nhelp and displays its true grief, because its legs are thin like the legs of Indo-Persian crossbred\ncocks. At the end of its shin there is a thin thorn and on the crown of its head there is a\nbunch of green variegated feathers.\nIts neck begins in the shape of a goblet and its stretch up to its belly is like the hair-dye of\nYemen in colour or like silk cloth put on a polished mirror which looks as if it has been\ncovered with a black veil, except that on account of its excessive lustre and extreme\nbrightness it appears that a lush green colour has been mixed with it.\nAlong the openings of its ears there is a line of shining bright daisy colour like the thin end of\na pen. Whiteness shines on the black background.\nThere is hardly a hue from which it has not taken a bit and improved it further by regular\npolish, lustre, silken brightness and brilliance.\nIt is therefore like scattered blossoms which have not been seasoned by the rains of spring or\nthe sun of the summer.\nIt also sheds its plumage and puts off its dress. They all fall away and grow again. They fall\nway from the feather stems like the falling of leaves from twigs, and then they begin to join\ntogether and grow till they return to the state that existed before their falling away.\nThe new hues do not change from the previous ones, nor does any colour occur in other than\nits own place. If you carefully look at one hair from the hairs of its feather stems it would\nlook like red rose, then emerald green and then golden yellow.\nHow can sharpness of intellect describe such a creation, or faculty of mind, or the utterances\nof describers manage to tell of it. Even its smallest parts have made it impossible for the\nimagination to pick them out or for tongues to describe them.\nGlorified is Allah who has disabled intellects from describing the creation which He placed\nopenly before the eyes and which they see bounded, shaped, arranged and coloured. He also\ndisabled tongues from briefly describing its qualities and also from expanding in its praise.\nThe magnificence of the Creator in great and small creation\nGlorified is Allah who has assigned feet to small ants and gnats and also to those above them,\nthe serpents and the elephants. He has made it obligatory upon Himself that no skeleton in\nwhich He infuses the spirit would move, but that death is its promised place and destruction\nits final end.\nA part of the same sermon\nDescribing Paradise\nIf you cast your mind's eye at what is described to you about Paradise, your heart would begin\nto hate the delicacies of this world that have been displayed here, namely its desires and its\npleasures, and the beauties of its scenes, and you would be lost in the rustling of the trees\nwhose roots lie hidden in the mounds of musk on the banks of the rivers in Paradise and in the\nattraction of the bunches of fresh pearls in the twigs and branches of those trees, and in the\nappearance of different fruits from under the cover of their leaves.\nThese fruits can be picked without difficulty as they come down at the desire of their pickers.\nPure honey and fermented wine will be handed round to those who settle down in the\ncourtyards of its palaces.\nThey are a people whom honour has always followed till they were made to settle in the\nhouse of eternal abode, and they obtained rest from the movement of journeying.\nO' listener! If you busy yourself in advancing towards these wonderful scenes which will rush\ntowards you, then your heart will certainly die due to eagerness for them, and you will be\nprepared to seek the company of those in the graves straight away from my audience here and\nhasten towards them. Allah may, by His mercy, include us and you too among those who\nstrive with their hearts for the abodes of the virtuous.\nNote explaining some of the wonderful and obscure portions of this sermon\nAs-Sayyid ar-Radi says: In Amir al-mu'minin's words \"ya'urru bimalaqihihi\", \"al-arr\" implies\n\"copulation\", e.g. when it is said \"arra'r-rajulu al-mar'ata ya'urruha\", it means \"He copulated\nwith the woman.\"\nIn his words \"ka'annahu qal"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"u dariyyin "}]},{"type":"text","value":"anajahu nutiyyuhu\", \"al-qal"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\" means the sail of a boat. \"dari\" means belonging to Darin which is a small town on the coast from where scents are bought.
