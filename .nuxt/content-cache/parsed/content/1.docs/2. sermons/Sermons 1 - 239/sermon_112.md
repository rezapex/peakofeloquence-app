It excites wonder with small things, is ornamented\nwith (false) hopes and decorated with deception. Its rejoicing does not last and its afflictions\ncannot be avoided.\nIt is deceitful, harmful, changing, perishable, exhaustible, liable to destruction, eating away\nand destructive. When it reaches the extremity of desires of those who incline towards it and\nfeel happy with it, the position is just what Allah, the Glorified, says (in the Qur'an):\n... like the water which send We down from heaven, and the herbage of the\nearth mingleth with it, then it becometh dry stubble which the winds scatter; for\nAllah over all things hath power. (18:45)\nNo person gets rejoicing from this world but tears come to him after it, and no one gets its\ncomforts in the front but he has to face hardships in the rear. No one receives the light rain of\nease in it but the heavy rain of distress pours upon him.\nIt is just worthy of this world that in the morning it supports a man but in the evening it does\nnot recognise him. If one side of it is sweet and pleasant the other side is bitter and\ndistressing.\nNo one secures enjoyment from its freshness but he has to face hardship from its calamities.\nNo one would pass the evening under the wing of safety but that his morning would be under\nthe feathers of the wing-tip of fear. It is deceitful, and all that is there in it is deception. It is\nperishable and all that is on it is to perish. There is no good in its provisions except in piety.\nWhoever takes little from it collects much of what would give him safety, while one who\ntakes much from it takes much of what would ruin him.\nHe would shortly depart from his collection. How many people relied on it but it distressed\nthem; (how many) felt peaceful with it but it tumbled them down; how many were prestigious\nbut it made them low and how many were proud but it made them disgraceful.\nIts authority is changing. Its life is dirty. Its sweet water is bitter. Its sweetness is like myrrh.\nIts foods are poisons. Its means are weak. The living in it is exposed to death; the healthy in it\nis exposed to disease. Its realm is (liable to be) snatched away. The strong in it is (liable to be)\ndefeated and the rich is (liable to be) afflicted with misfortune. The neighbour in it is (liable\nto be) plundered.\nAre you not (residing) in the houses of those before you, who were of longer ages, better\ntraces, had bigger desires, were more in numbers and had greater armies.\nHow they devoted themselves to the world and how they showed preference to it! Then they\nleft it without any provision that could convey them through, or the back (of a beast for\nriding) to carry them.\nDid you get the news that the world was ever generous enough to present ransom for them, or\ngave them any support or afforded them good company? It rather inflicted them with troubles,\nmade them languid with calamities, molested them with catastrophes, threw them down on\ntheir noses, trampled them under hoofs and helped the vicissitudes of time against them.\nYou have observed its strangeness towards those who went near it, acquired it and\nappropriated it, till they depart from it for good. Did it give them any provision other than\nstarvation or make them stay in other than narrow places, or give them light other than gloom,\nor give them in the end anything other than repentance? Is this what you much ask for or\nremain satisfied with, or towards which you feel greedy? How bad is this abode for him who\ndid not suspect it (to be so) and did not entertain fear from it?\nYou should know as you do know, that you have to leave it and depart from it. While in it,\ntake lesson from those \"who proclaimed 'who is more powerful than we'\" (Qur'an , 41 :15) but\nthey were carried to their graves, though not as riders.\nThey were then made to stay in the graves, but not as guests. Graves were made for them\nfrom the surface of the ground. Their shrouds were made from earth. Old bones were made\ntheir neighbour. They are neighbours who do not answer a caller nor ward off trouble, nor pay\nheed to a mourner.\nIf they get rain they do not feel happy, and if they face famine they do not get disappointed.\nThey are together but each one apart. They are close together but do not see each other. They\nare near but do not meet. They are enduring and have no hatred. They are ignorant and their\nmalice has died away. There is no fear of trouble from them and no hope of their warding off\n(troubles). They have exchanged the back (surface) of the earth with its stomach (interior),\nvastness with narrowness, family with loneliness, and light with darkness.\nThey have come to it (this world) as they had left it with bare feet and naked bodies. They\ndeparted from it with their acts towards the continuing life and everlasting house as Allah has\nsaid:\n. . . As We caused the first creation, so will We get it return. (It is) a promise\nbinding Us, verily We were doing it.
