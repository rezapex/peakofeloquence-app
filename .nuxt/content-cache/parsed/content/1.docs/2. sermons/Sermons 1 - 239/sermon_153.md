Senses cannot touch Him and curtains cannot veil Him, because of\nthe difference between the Maker and the made, the Limiter and the limited and the Sustainer\nand the sustained.\nHe is One but not by the first in counting, is Creator but not through activity or labour, is\nHearer but not by means of any physical organ, is Looker but not by a stretching of eyelids, is\nWitness but not by nearness, is Distinct but not by measurement of distance, is Manifest but\nnot by seeing and is Hidden but not by subtlety (of body).\nHe is Distinct from things because He overpowers them and exercises might over them, while\nthings are distinct from Him because of their subjugation to Him and their turning towards\nHim.\nHe who describes Him limits Him. He who limits Him numbers Him. He who numbers Him\nrejects His eternity. He who said \"how\" sought a description for Him.\nHe who said \"where\" bounded him. He is the Knower even though there be nothing to be\nknown. He is the Sustainer even though there be nothing to be sustained. He is the Powerful\neven though there be nothing to be overpowered.\nA part of the same sermon about the Divine leaders (Imams)\nThe riser has risen, the sparkler has sparkled, the appearer has appeared and the curved has\nbeen straightened. Allah has replaced one people with another and one day with another.\nWe awaited these changes as the famine-stricken await the rain. Certainly the Imams are the\nvicegerents of Allah over His creatures and they make the creatures know Allah. No one will\nenter Paradise except he who knows them and knows Him, and no one will enter Hell except\nhe who denies them and denies Him.\nAllah the Glorified, has distinguished you with Islam and has chosen you for it. This is\nbecause it is the name of safety and the collection of honour. Allah the Glorified, chose its\nway and disclosed its pleas through open knowledge and secret maxims.\nIts (Qur'an)wonders are not exhausted and its delicacies do not end. It contains blossoming\nbounties and lamps of darkness. (The doors of) virtues cannot be opened save with its keys,\nnor can gloom be dispelled save with its lamps. Allah has protected its inaccessible points\n(from enemies) and allowed grazing (to its followers) in its pastures. It contains cover (from\nthe ailment of misguidance) for the seeker of cure and full support for the seeker of support.\n(1). The first part of this sermon consists of important issues concerning the science of\nknowledge about Allah, wherein Amir al-mu'minin has thrown light on the matter that Allah is\nfrom ever and His attributes are the same as He Himself. When we cast a glance at creation,\nwe see that for every movement there is a mover, from which every man of ordinary wisdom is\ncompelled to conclude that no effect can appear without a cause, so much so, that even an\ninfant a few days old, when his body is touched, feels in the depth of his consciousness that\nsomeone has touched him.\nHe indicates it by opening his eyes or turning and looking. How then can the creation of the\nworld and the system of all creation be arranged without a Creator or Organiser?\nOnce it is necessary to believe in a Creator, then He should exist by Himself, because\neverything which has a beginning must have a centre of existence from which it should\nterminate.\nIf that too needed a creator, there would be the question of whether this creator is also the\ncreation of some other creator or exists by itself. Thus unless a Self-created Creator is believed\nin, who should be the cause of all causes, the mind will remain groping in the unending\nlabyrinth of cause and effect, and never attain the idea of the last extremity of the series of\ncreation. It would fall into the fallacy of circular arguing and would not reach any end.\nIf the creator were taken to have created himself, then there would be (one of the two\npositions, namely) either he should be non-existent or existent.\nIf he were not existent, then it would not be possible for something non-existent to create any\nexistent being. If he were existent before creating himself, there would be no sense in coming\ninto being again. Therefore it is necessary to believe that the Creator should be a Being not\ndependent on any other creator for His own existence, and everything else should be\ndependent on Him.\nThis dependence of the entire creation is a proof that the existence of the Source of all\ncreation is from ever and eternal. And since all beings other than He are subject to change, are\ndependent on position and place and are similar to one another in qualities and properties, and\nsince similarity leads to plurality whereas unity has no like save itself, therefore nothing can be\nlike Him.\nEven things called one cannot be reckoned after His Unity because He is One and Singular in\nevery respect. He is free and pure from all those attributes which are found in body or matter\nbecause He is neither body, nor colour, nor shape, nor does He lie in any direction, nor is He\nbounded within some place or locality. Therefore, man cannot see or understand Him through\nhis senses or feelings, because senses can know only those things which accord with the\nlimitations of time, place and matter. To believe that He can be seen is to believe that He has\nbody, but since He is not a body, and He does not exist through a body, and He does not lie in\nany direction or place, there is no question of His being seen.\nBut His being unseen is not like that of subtle material bodies, due to whose delicacy the eye\npierces through them and eyes remain unable to see them; as for example the wind in the vast\nfirmament. But He is unseen by His very existence.\nNevertheless, nothing is unseen for Him. He sees as well as hears, but is not dependent on\ninstruments of seeing or hearing, because if He were in need of organs of the body for hearing\nand seeing He would be in need of external things for His perfection and would not be a\nperfect Being, whereas He should be perfect in all respects and no attribute of perfection\nshould be apart from His Self.\nTo believe in attributes separately from His Self would mean that there would be a self and a\nfew attributes and the compound of the self and the attributes would be Allah. But a thing\nwhich is compounded is dependent on its parts and these parts must exist before their\ncomposition into the whole. When the parts exist from before, how can the whole be from ever\nand eternal because its existence is later than that of its parts.\nBut Allah had the attributes of knowledge, power and sustaining even when nothing was\nexistent, because none of His attributes were created in Him from outside, but His attributes\nare His Self and His Self is His attributes. Consequently, His knowledge does not depend on the\nobject of knowledge existing first and then His knowledge, because His Self is prior to things\ncoming into existence.\nNor is it necessary for His power that there should first exist the object to be over-powered and\nthen alone He would be called Powerful, because Powerful is that who has power equally for\ndoing or abandoning and as such the existence of the object to be over-powered is not\nnecessary.\nSimilarly Sustainer means master. Just as He is the Master of the non-existent after its coming\ninto existence, in the same way He has power to bring it into existence from non-existence,\nnamely if He so wills He may bestow existence upon it."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":",.\n,. ,. ,.\n,.\n,. ,. ,.\n,. ,. ,.\n,."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_153.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_153.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"bTRauP2dB0"}
