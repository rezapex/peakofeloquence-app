People\nhad been in slumber for a long time and the twist of the rope had loosened. The Prophet came\nwith (a Book containing) testification to what (books) were already there and also with a light\nto be followed.\nIt is the Qur'an. If you ask it to speak it won't do so; but I will tell you about it. Know that it\ncontains knowledge of what is to come about, stories of the past, cure for your ills and\nregulation for whatever faces you.\nA part of the same sermon\nAbout the autocracy of the Umayyads\nAt that time there will remain no house or tent but oppressors would inflict it with grief and\ninject sickness in it. On that day no one in the sky will listen to their excuse and no one on the\nearth will come to their help. You selected for the governance (caliphate) one who is not fit\nfor it, and you raised him to a position which was not meant for him.\nShortly Allah will take revenge from every one who has oppressed, food for food and drink\nfor drink, namely (they will be given) colocynth for eating, myrrh and aloes for drinking, and\nfear for an inner and the sword for an outer covering.\nThey are nothing but carrier-beasts laden with sins and camels laden with evil deeds. I swear\nand again swear that the Umayyads will have to spit out the caliphate as phlegm is spat and\nthereafter they will never taste it nor relish its flavour so long as day and night rotate."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_159.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_159.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"Qvp2kNyS5h"}
