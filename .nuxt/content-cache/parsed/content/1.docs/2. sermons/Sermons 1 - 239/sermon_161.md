His pleasure implies protection and mercy. He\ndecides with knowledge and forgives with forbearance.\nO' my Allah! Praise be to Thee for what Thou takest and givest and for that from which Thou\ncurest or with which Thou afflictest; praise which is the most acceptable to Thee, the most\nlike by Thee and the most dignified before Thee; praise which fills all Thy creation and\nreaches where Thou desirest; praise which is not veiled from Thee and does not end, and\nwhose continuity does not cease.\nGreatness of Allah\nWe do not know the reality of Thy greatness except that we know that thou art Ever-living\nand Self-subsisting by Whom all things subsist. Drowsiness or sleep do not overtake Thee,\nvision does not reach Thee and sight does not grasp Thee. Thou seest the eyes and countest\nthe ages. Thou holdest (people as slaves) by foreheads and feet.\nWe see Thy creation and wonder over it because of Thy might, and describe it as (a result of)\nThy great authority; whereas what is hidden from us, of which our sight has fallen short,\nwhich our intelligence has not attained, and between which and ourselves curtains of the\nunknown have been cast, is far greater.\nHe who frees his heart (from all other engagements) and exerts his thinking in order to know\nhow Thou established Thy throne, how Thou created Thy creatures, how Thou suspended the\nair in Thy skies and how Thou spread Thy earth on the waves of water, his eyes would return\ntired, his intelligence defeated, his ears eager and his thinking awander.\nA part of the same sermon about hope and fear in Allah.\nHe claims according to his own thinking that he hopes from Allah. By Allah, the Great, he\nspeaks a lie. The position is that his hope (in Allah) does not appear through his action\nalthough the hope of every one who hopes is known through his action.\nEvery hope is so, except the hope in Allah, the Sublime, if it is impure; and every fear is\nestablished except the fear for Allah if it is unreal.\nHe hopes big things from Allah and small things from men but he gives to man (such\nconsideration as) he does not give to Allah. What is the matter with Allah, glorified be His\npraise? He is accorded less (consideration) than what is given to His creatures. Do you ever\nfear to be false in your hope in Allah? Or do you not regard Him the centre of your hope?\nSimilarly, if a man fears man he gives him (such consideration) out of his fear which he does\nnot give to Allah. Thus, he has made his fear for men ready currency while his fear from the\nCreator is mere deferment or promise. This is the case of every one in whose eye this world\nappears big (and important) and in whose heart its position is great. He prefers it over Allah,\nso he inclines towards it, and becomes its devotee.\nThe example of the Holy Prophet\nCertainly, in the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him and his progeny)\nwas sufficient example for you and a proof concerning the vices of the world, its defects, the\nmultitude of its disgraces and its evils, because its sides had been constrained for him, while\nits flanks had been spread for others; he was deprived of its milk and turned away from its\nadornments.\nThe example of Musa (Moses)\nIf you want, I will, as a second example, relate to you concerning Musa, the Interlocutor of\nAllah (p.b.u.h.) when he said: O' Allah! I need whatever good Thou mayest grant me (Qur'an,\n28:24). By Allah, he asked Him only for bread to eat because he was used to eating the herbs\nof the earth, and the greenness of the herbs could be seen from the delicate skin of his belly\ndue to his thinness and paucity of his flesh.\nThe example of Dawud (David)\nIf you desire I can give you a third example of Dawud (p.b.u.h.). He is the holder of the\nPsalms and the reciter among the people of Paradise. He used to prepare baskets of date palm\nleaves with his own hands and would say to his companions: \"Which of you will help me by\npurchasing it?\" He used to eat barley bread (bought) out of its price.\nThe example of "},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Isa (Jesus) If you desire I will tell you about "}]},{"type":"text","value":"Isa (p.b.u.h.) son of Maryam (Mary). He used a stone for\nhis pillow, put on coarse clothes and ate rough food. His condiment was hunger. His lamp at\nnight was the moon. His shade during the winter was just the expanse of earth eastward and\nwestward. His fruits and flowers were only what grows from the earth for the cattle.\nHe had no wife to allure him, nor any son to give grief, nor wealth to deviate (his attention),\nnor greed to disgrace him. His two feet were his conveyance and his two hands his servant.\nFollowing the example of the Holy Prophet\nYou should follow your Prophet, the pure, the chaste, may Allah bless him and his\ndescendants. In him is the example for the follower, and the consolation for the seeker of\nconsolation. The most beloved person before Allah is he who follows His Prophet and who\ntreads in his footsteps. He took the least (share) from this world and did not take a full glance\nat it.\nOf all the people of the world he was the least satiated and the most empty of stomach. The\nworld was offered to him but he refused to accept it. When he knew that Allah, the Glorified,\nhated a thing, he too hated it; that Allah held a thing low, he too held it low; that Allah held a\nthing small, he too held it small. If we love what Allah and His Prophet hate and hold great\nwhat Allah and His prophet hold small that would be enough isolation from Allah and\ntransgression of His commands.\nThe Prophet used to eat on the ground, and sat like a slave. He repaired his shoe with his\nhand, and patched his clothes with his hand. He would ride an unsaddled ass and would seat\nsomeone behind him. If there was a curtain on his door with pictures on it he would say to\none of his wives. \"O' such-and-such, take it away out of my sight because if I look at it I recall\nthe world and its allurements.\" Thus, he removed his heart from this world and destroyed its\nremembrance from his mind.\nHe loved that its allurements should remain hidden from his eye so that he should not secure\ngood dress from it, should not regard it a place of stay and should not hope to live in it.\nConsequently, he removed it from his mind, let it go away from his heart and kept it hidden\nfrom his eyes. In the same way he who hates a thing should hate to look at it or to hear about\nit.\nCertainly there was in the Prophet of Allah all that would apprise you of the evils of this\nworld and its defects, namely that he remained hungry along with his chief companions, and\ndespite his great nearness the allurements of the world remained remote from him. Now, one\nshould see with one's intelligence whether Allah honoured Muhammad (the peace and\nblessings of Allah be upon him and his descendants) as a result of this or disgraced him. If he\nsays that Allah disgraced him, he certainly lies and perpetrates a great untruth.\nIf he says Allah honoured him, he should know that Allah dishonoured the others when He\nextended the (benefits of the) world for him but held them away from him who was the\nnearest to Him of all men.\nTherefore, one should follow His Prophet, tread in his footsteps and enter through his\nentrance. Otherwise he will not be safe from ruin. Certainly, Allah made Muhammad (the\npeace and blessing of Allah be upon him and his descendants) a sign for the Day of\nJudgement. a conveyor of tidings for Paradise and a warner of retribution.\nHe left this world hungry but entered upon the next world safe. He did not lay one stone upon\nanother (to make a house) till he departed and responded to the call of Allah. How great is\nAllah's blessing in that He blessed us with the Prophet as a predecessor whom we follow and\na leader behind whom we tread.\nThe example of himself\nBy Allah, I have been putting patches in my shirts so much that now I feel shy of the patcher.\nSomeone asked me whether I would not put it off, but I said, \"Get away from me.\" Only in\nthe morning do people (realised the advantage of and) speak highly of the night journey."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_161.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_161.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"Wk2HO3VajM"}
