He is the God of the creation and its feeder.\nThe sun and the moon are steadily moving in pursuit of His will. They make every fresh thing\nold and every distant thing near.\nHe distributed their sustenance and has counted their deeds and acts, the number of their\nbreaths, their concealed looks, and whatever is hidden in their bosoms. He knows their places\nof stay and places of last resort in the loins and wombs till they reach their end.\nHis punishment on enemies is harsh despite the extent of His Mercy, and His compassion on\nHis friends is vast despite His harsh punishment. He overpowers one who wants to overcome\nHim, and destroys one who clashes with Him.\nHe disgraces one who opposes Him and gains sway over one who bears Him hostility. He is\nsufficient for one who relies on Him. He gives one who asks Him. He repays one who lends\nto Him. He rewards one who thanks Him.\nO' creatures of Allah, weigh yourselves before you are weighed and assess yourselves before\nyou are assessed. Breathe before suffocation of the throat. Be submissive before you are\nharshly driven. Know that if one does not help himself in acting as his own adviser and\nwarner then no one else can (effectively) be his adviser or warner."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_91.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_91.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"Ujbtythgg9"}
