Whenever a vanguard\nforce of Syria (ash-Sham) hovers over you, everyone of you shuts his door and hides himself\nlike the lizard in its hole or a badger it its den.\nBy Allah, he whom people like you support must suffer disgrace and he who throws arrows\nwith your support is as if he throws arrows that are broken both at head and tail. By Allah,\nwithin the courtyard you are quite numerous but under the banner you are only a few.\nCertainly, I know what can improve you and how your crookedness can be straightened. But I\nshall not improve your condition by marring myself.\nAllah may disgrace your faces and destroy you. You do not understand the right as you\nunderstand the wrong and do not crush the wrong as you crush the right."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_70.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_70.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"84PrImwuOJ"}
