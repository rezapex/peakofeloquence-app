For the people of this period nothing will be more valueless\nthan the Qur'an being recited as it ought to be recited, nor anything more valuable than the\nQur'an being misplaced from its position. And in the towns nothing will be more hated than\nvirtue, nor anything more acceptable than vice.\nThe holders of the book will throw it away and its memorisers would forget it. In these days\nthe Qur'an and its people will be exiled and expelled. They will be companions keeping\ntogether on one path, but no one will offer them asylum. Consequently at this time the Qur'an\nand its people will be among the people but not among them, will be with them but not with\nthem, because misguidance cannot accord with guidance even though they may be together.\nThe people will have united on division and will therefore have cut away from the\ncommunity, as though they were the leaders of the Qur'an and not the Qur'an their leader.\nNothing of it will be left with them except its name, and they will know nothing save its\nwriting and its words. Before that, they will inflict hardships on the virtuous, naming the\nlatter's truthful views about Allah false allegations, and enforcing for virtues the punishment\nof the vice.\nThose before you passed away because of the lengthening of their desires and the forgetting\nof their death, till that promised event befell them about which excuses are turned down,\nrepentance is denied and punishment and retribution is inflicted.\nAbout Ahlu'l-bayt\nO' people, he who seeks counsel from Allah secures guidance and he who adopts His word as\nguide is led towards what is more straight, because Allah's lover feels secure and His\nopponent feels afraid.\nIt does not behove one who knows His greatness to assume greatness, but the greatness of\nthose who know His greatness is that they should know before Him, and the safety for those\nwho know what His power is lies in submitting to Him. Do not be scared away from the truth\nlike the scaring of the healthy from the scabbed person, or the sound person from the sick.\nYou should know that you will never know guidance unless you know who has abandoned it,\nyou will never abide by the pledges of the Qur'an unless you know who has broken them, and\nwill never cling to it unless you know who has forsaken it. Seek these things from those who\nown them because they are the life spring of knowledge and death of ignorance.\nThey are the people whose commands will disclose to you their (extent of) knowledge, their\nsilence will disclose their (capacity of) speaking and their outer appearance will disclose their\ninner self. They do not go against religion, and do not differ from one other about it, while it\nis among them a truthful witness and a silent speaker."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_148.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_148.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"ZPvFD4dLLA"}
