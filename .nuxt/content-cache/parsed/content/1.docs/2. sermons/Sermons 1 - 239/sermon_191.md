He has a strong army. His dignity is grand. I stand witness that Muhammad - peace\nand blessing of Allah be upon him and his progeny - is His slave and His Prophet.\nHe called (people) to His obedience and overpowered His enemies by fighting for the sake of\nHis religion. People's joining together to falsify him and their attempt to extinguish His light\ndid not prevent him from it.\nYou should therefore exercise fear of Allah because it has a rope whose twist is strong and its\npinnacle is lofty and invulnerable. Hasten toward death in its pangs (by doing good acts) and\nbe prepared for it before its approach, because the ultimate end is the Day of Judgement.\nThis is enough preaching for one who understands and enough of a lesson for one who does\nnot know. What idea do you have, before reaching that end, of the narrowness of grave, the\nhardship of loneliness, fear of the passage towards the next world, the pangs of fear, the\nshifting of ribs here and there (due to narrowing of the grave), the deafness of ears, the\ndarkness of the grave, fear of the promised punishment, the closing of the receptacle of the\ngrave and the laying of stones?\nTherefore, (fear) Allah, (fear) Allah, O' creatures of Allah, because the world is behaving with\nyou in the usual way and you and the Day of Judgement are in the same rope (close to each\nother).\nAs though it has come with its signs, has approached with its pleas and has made you stand in\nits way; and as though it has come forward with all its quakings and has settled down with its\nchest on the ground while the world has parted from its people and has turned them out of its\nlap.\nIt was like a day that has passed or a month that has gone by. Its new things have become old\nand the fat ones have become thin.\nThey are in a narrow place, in very complicated affairs and in a fire whose pain is sharp, cries\nare loud, flames are rising, sound is trembling, burning is severe, abatement is remote; its fuel\nis burning, its threats are fearful, its hollows are hidden, its sides are dark, its vessels are\naflame, and everything about it is abominable.\nAnd shall be conveyed those who feared (the wrath of) their Lord, in\ncompanies unto the garden. . . (Qur'an. 39:73)\nThey are safe from chastisement, away from punishment, and kept aloof from fire. Their\nabode will be peaceful and they will be pleased with their longing and their place of stay.\nThese are the people whose acts in this world were chaste, their eyes were tearful, their nights\nin this world were like days because of fearing and seeking forgiveness, and their days were\nlike nights because of feeling of loneliness and separation.\nTherefore, Allah made Paradise the place of their (eventual) return and a reward in\nrecompense.... They were most eligible and suitable for it;... (Qur'an, 48:26) in the eternal\ndomain and everlasting favours.\nTherefore, O' creatures of Allah, pay regard to all that by being regardful of which one will\nsucceed and by ignoring which one will incur loss, and hasten towards your death by means\nof your (good) acts, because you are bound by what you have done in the past and you have\nto your credit only what (good acts) you have sent forward.\n(Behave in such a way) as though the feared event (death) has come upon you, so that you\ncannot return (to do good acts) nor can you be cleared of evil acts. Allah may prompt us and\nyou for His obedience and obedience of His Prophet, and forgive us and you by His great\nmercy.\nStick to the earth, keep patient in trials, do not move your hands and swords after the liking of\nyour tongues, and do not make haste in matters in which Allah has not asked for haste\nbecause any one of you who dies in his bed while he had knowledge of the rights of Allah and\nthe rights of His Prophet and members of the Prophet's house, will die as martyr.\nHis reward is incumbent on Allah. He is also eligible to the recompense of what good acts he\nhas intended to do, since his intention takes the place of drawing his sword. Certainly, for\nevery thing there is a time and a limit."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":",. ,. ,.\n,. ,. ,.\n,. ,. ,.\n,."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_191.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_191.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"8DOGcm7AKZ"}
