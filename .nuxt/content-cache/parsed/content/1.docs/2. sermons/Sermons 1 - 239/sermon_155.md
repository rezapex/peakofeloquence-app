He knows his low road as well as his high\nroad. The caller has called. The shepherd has tended (his flocks). So respond to the caller and\nfollow the shepherd.\nThey (the opposers) have entered the oceans of disturbance and have taken to innovations\ninstead of the Sunnah (the Prophet's holy deeds, utterances and his unspoken approvals),\nwhile the believers have sunk down, and the misguided and the liars are speaking. We are the\nnear ones, companions, treasure holders and doors (to the Sunnah). Houses are not entered\nsave through their doors. Whoever enters them from other than the door is called a thief.\nA part of the same sermon\nThe delicacies of the Qur'an are about them (Ahlu'l-bayt, the descendants of the Prophet) and\nthey are the treasurers of Allah. When they speak they speak the truth, but when they keep\nquiet no one can speak unless they speak. The forerunner should report correctly to his\npeople, should retain his wits and should be one of the children (a man) of the next world,\nbecause he has come from there and would return to it.\nThe beginning of the action of one who sees with heart and acts with eyes it is to assess\nwhether the action will go against him or for him. If it is for him he indulges in it, but if it is\nagainst him he keeps away from it. For, he who acts without knowledge is like one who treads\nwithout a path. Then his deviation from the path keeps him at a distance from his aim. And he\nwho acts according to knowledge is like he who treads the clear path. Therefore, he who can\nsee should see whether he should proceed or return.\nYou should also know that the outside (of every thing) has a similar inside. Of whatever the\noutside is good, its inside too is good, and whatever the outside is bad, its inside too is bad.\nThe truthful Prophet (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him and his progeny) has said that:\n\"Allah may love a man but hate his action, and may love the action but hate the man.\n\" You should also know that every action is like a vegetation, and a vegetation cannot do\nwithout water while waters are different. So where the water is good the plant is good and its\nfruits are sweet, whereas where the water is bad. the plant will also be bad and its fruits will\nbe bitter."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_155.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_155.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"6uSOHkfVEH"}
