Time will deal with the survivors just as it dealt with those gone by.\nThe time that has passed will not return and whatever there is in it will not stay for ever. Its\nlater deeds are the same as the former ones. Its trouble try to excel one another. Its banners\nfollow each other. It is as though you are attached to the last day which is driving you as\nrapidly as are driven the she camels which are dry for seven months.\nHe who busies himself with things other than improvement of his own self becomes\nperplexed in darkness and entangled in ruination. His evil spirits immerse him deep in vices\nand make his bad actions appear handsome.\nParadise is the end of those who are forward (in good acts) and Hell is the end of those who\ncommit excesses.\nKnow O' creatures of Allah! that piety is a strong house of protection while impiety is a weak\nhouse which does not protect its people, and does not give security to him who takes refuge\ntherein. Know that the sting of sins is cut by piety and the final aim is achieved by conviction\nof belief.\nO' creatures of Allah! (fear) Allah, (fear) Allah, in the matter of your own selves, which are\nthe most beloved and dear to you, because Allah has clarified to you the way of truthfulness\nand lighted its paths. So (you may choose) either ever-present misfortune or eternal\nhappiness. You should therefore provide in these mortal days for the eternal days. You have\nbeen informed of the provision, ordered to march and told to make haste in setting off.\nYou are like staying riders who do not know when they would be ordered to march on.\nBeware, what will he, who has been created for the next world, do with this world? What will\na person do with wealth which he would shortly be deprived of while only its ill effects and\nreckoning would be left behind for him?\nO' creatures of Allah! the good which Allah has promised should not be abandoned and the\nevil from which He has refrained should not be coveted. O' creatures of Allah! fear the day\nwhen actions will be reckoned; there will be much quaking and even children will get old.\nKnow, O' creatures of Allah! that your own self is a guard over you; limbs are watchmen and\ntruthful vigil-keepers who preserve (the record of) your actions and the numbers of your\nbreaths. The gloom of the dark night cannot conceal you from them, nor can closed doors\nhide you from them. Surely tomorrow is close to today.\nToday will depart with all that it has and tomorrow will come in its wake. It is as though\nevery one of you has reached that place on earth where he would be alone, namely the\nlocation of his grave. So, what to say of the lonely house, the solitary place of staying and the\nsolitary exile.\nIt is as though the cry (of the Horn) has reached you, the Hour has overtaken you and you\nhave come out (of your graves) for the passing of judgement.\n(The curtains of) falsehood have been removed from you and your excuses have become\nweak. The truth about you has been proved. All your matters have proceeded to their\nconsequences. Therefore. you should (now) take counsel from examples, learn lessons from\nvicissitudes and take advantage of the warners."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_158.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_158.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"2urnaMqin5"}
