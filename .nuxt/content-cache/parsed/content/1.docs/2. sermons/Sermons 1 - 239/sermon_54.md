Its\nsubject is the downfall of the world and reward and punishment in the next world.\nBeware, the world is wrapping itself up and has announced its departure. Its known things\nhave become strangers and it is speedily moving backward.\nIt is advancing its inhabitants towards destruction and driving its neighbours towards death.\nIts sweet things (enjoyments) have become sour, and its clear things have become polluted.\nConsequently, what has remained of it is just like the remaining water in a vessel or a\nmouthful of water in the measure.\nIf a thirsty person drinks it his thirst is not quenched.\nO' creatures of Allah get ready to go out of this world for whose inhabitants decay is\nordained, and (beware) heart's wishes should overpower you, nor should you take your stay\n(in life) to be long. By Allah, if you cry like the she-camel that has lost its young one, call out\nlike the cooing of pigeons, make noise like devoted recluses and turn to Allah leaving your\nwealth and children as a means to secure His nearness and high position with Him or the\nforgiveness of sins which have been covered by His books and recorded by His angels it\nwould be less than His reward that I expect for you or His retribution that I fear about you.\nBy Allah, if your hearts melt down thoroughly and your eyes shed tears of blood either in\nhope for Him or for fear from Him and you are also allowed to live in this world all the time\nthat it lasts even then your actions cannot pay for His great bounties over you and His having\nguided you towards faith.\nA part of the same sermon on the description of the Day of Sacrifice (`Id al-Adha) and the\nqualities of the animal for sacrifice\nFor an animal to be fully fit for sacrifice it is necessary that both its ears should be raised\nupwards and its eyes should be healthy. If the ears and the eyes are sound the animal of\nsacrifice is sound and perfect, even though its horn be broken or it drags its feet to the place\nof sacrifice.\nas-Sayyid ar-Radi says: Here place of sacrifice means place of slaughter."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_54.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_54.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"bTtIIAP4bJ"}
