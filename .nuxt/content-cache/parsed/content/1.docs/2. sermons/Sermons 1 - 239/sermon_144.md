Seek ye the forgiveness of your Lord! Verily, He is the Most-forgiving, He\nwill send (down) upon you the cloud raining in torrents, and help you with\nwealth and sons (children) . . . (Qur'an, 17:10-12)\nAllah may shower mercy on him who took up repentance, gave up sins and hastened (in\nperforming good acts before) his death.\nO' my Allah! we have come out to Thee from under the curtains and coverings (of houses)\nwhen the beasts and children are crying, seeking Thy Mercy, hoping for the generosity of Thy\nbounty an fearing Thy chastisement and retribution. O' my Allah! give us to drink from Thy\nrain and do not disappoint us, nor kill us by years (of drought) nor punish us for what the\nfoolish among us have committed, O' the Most Merciful of all.\nO' my Allah! we have come out to Thee to complain to Thee who is (already) not hidden from\nThee, when the seven troubles have forced us, droughty famines have driven us, distressing\nwants have made us helpless and troublesome mischiefs have incessantly befallen us.\nO' my Allah! we beseech Thee not to send us back disappointed nor to return us with downcast\neyes, nor to address us (harshly) for our sins, nor deal with us according to our deeds.\nO' my Allah! do pour on us Thy mercy, Thy blessing, Thy sustenance and Thy pity, and make\nus enjoy a drink which benefits us, quenches our thirst, produces green herbage with which all\nthat was lost gets a growing and all that had withered comes to life again.\nIt should bring about the benefit of freshness and plentifulness of ripe fruits. With it plains\nmay be watered, rivers may begin flowing, plants may pick up foliage and prices may come\ndown. Surely, Thou art powerful over whatever Thou willest."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_144.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_144.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"btH0XK3S7W"}
