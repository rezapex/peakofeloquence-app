So these, may be, Allah will pardon them; and Allah is the Clement, the Oft-forgiving. (4:97-99) The meaning of Amir al-mu'minin here is that hijrah (immigration) was not only obligatory during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet, but it is a permanent obligation. This immigration is even now obligatory for attaining the proof of Allah and the true religion. Therefore, if one has attained the proof of Allah and believed&127; in it, even if he is in midst of the unbelievers of his locality, he is not duty bound to immigrate. The \"mustad"}]},{"type":"text","value":"af\" (weakened) is one who is living among the unbelievers and is far from being\ninformed of the proofs of Allah, and at the same time he is unable to immigrate in order to\nattain the proofs of Allah.\n(2). Some people have explained this saying of Amir al-mu'minin to mean that by the passages\nof the earth he means matters of the world and by passages of the sky matters of religious law\nand that Amir al-mu'minin intends to say that he knows the matters of religious law and\ncommandments more than the worldly matters. Thus, Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani writes (in Sharh\nNahj al-balaghah, vol. 4, pp. 200-201):\nIt is related from al-"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Allamah al-Wabari, that he said that Amir al-mu'minin's intention is to say that the scope of his religious knowledge is larger than his knowledge about matters of the world. But taking the context into account, this explanation cannot be held to be correct because this sentence (which is the subject of explanation) has been used as the cause of the sentence \"Ask me before you miss me\", and after it, is the prophesy about revolt. In between these two the occurrence of the sentence that \"I know religious matters more than worldly matters\", makes the whole utterance quite uncounted, because Amir al-mu'minin's challenge to ask whatever one likes is not confined to matters of religious law only so this sentence could be held as its cause. Then, after that, the prophesy of the rising up of the revolt has nothing to do with matters of religious law, so that it could be put forth as a proof of more knowledge of religious matters. To ignore the clear import of the words and to interpret them in a way which does not suit the occasion, does not exhibit a correct spirit, when from the context also the same meaning accrues which the words openly convey. Thus, it is to give a warning about the Umayyad's mischief that Amir al-mu'minin uttered the words: \"'Ask me whatever you like'; because I know the paths and courses of divine destiny more than the passages of the earth. So, even if you ask me about matters which are recorded in the 'preserved tablet' and concern divine destiny I can tell you, and a serious mischief is to rise against me in those matters in which you should have doubt, because my eyes are more acquainted with those ethereal lines which concern the occurrence of events and mischiefs than, with what I know about live appearing on the earth. The occurrence of this mischief is as certain as an object seen with eyes. You should therefore ask me its details and the way to keep safe from it, so that you may be able to manage your defence when the times comes.\" This meaning is supported by the successive sayings of Amir al-mu'minin which he uttered in connection with the unknown, and to which the future testified. Thus, Ibn Abi'l Hadid comments on this claim of Amir al-mu'minin as follows: Amir al-mu'minin's claim is also supported by his sayings about future events which he uttered not once or a hundred times but continuously and successively, from which there remains no doubt that whatever he spoke was on the basis of knowledge and certainly and not in the way of chance. (Sharh Nahj al-balaghah, vol. 13, p. 106) In connection with this saying of Amir al-mu'minin it has already been shown and explained (in Sermon 92, Foot-note No. 2) that no one else dared advance such a claim, and those who made such a claim had to face only disgrace and humility.
