Abu Dharr al-Ghifari's name was Jundab ibn Junadah. He was an inhabitant of ar-\nRabadhah which was a small village on the east side of Medina. When he heard about the\nproclamation of the Prophet, he came to Mecca and after making enquires saw the Prophet\nand accepted Islam whereupon the unbelievers of Quraysh gave him all sorts of troubles and\ninflicted pain after pain, but he remained steadfast.\nAmong the acceptors of Islam he is the third, fourth or fifth.
