I beseech Thee to take revenge on the Quraysh and those who are assisting\nthem, for they have cut asunder my kinship and over-turned my cup and have joined together\nto contest a right to which I was entitled more than anyone else. They said to me: \"If you get\nyour right, that will be just, but if you are denied the right, that too will be just.\nEndure it with sadness or kill yourself in grief.\" I looked around but found no one to shield\nme, protect me or help me except the members of my family. I refrained from flinging them\ninto death and therefore closed my eyes despite the dust, kept swallowing saliva despite (the\nsuffocation of) grief and endured pangs of anger although it was more bitter than colocynth\nand more grievous than the bite of knives.\nas-Sayyid ar-Radi says: This utterance of Amir al-mu'minin hasalready appeared in an earlier\nSermon (171), but I have repeated it here because of the difference of versions.\nA part of the same sermon about those whowent to Basrah to fight Amir al-mu'minin\nThey marched on my officers and the custodians of the public treasury which is still under my\ncontrol and on the people of a metropolis, all of whom were obedient to me and were in\nallegiance to me.\nThey created division among them, instigated their party against me and attacked my\nfollowers. They killed a group of them by treachery, while another group took up swords\nagainst them and fought with the swords till they met Allah as adherents to truth."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_218.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_218.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"dshuhZlDOR"}
