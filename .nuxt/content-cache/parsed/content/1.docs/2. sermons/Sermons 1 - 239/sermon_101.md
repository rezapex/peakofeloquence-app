We praise Him in all His affairs and seek His assistance for\nfulfilment of His rights.\nWe stand witness that there is no god except He and that Muhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.p. ) is His\nslave and Prophet. He sent him to manifest His commands and speak about His remembrance.\nConsequently, he fulfilled it with trustworthiness, and he passed away while on the right path.\nHe left among us the standard of right. Whoever goes further from it goes out of Faith,\nwhoever lags behind it is ruined. Whoever sticks to it would join (the right). Its guide is short\nof speech, slow of steps, and quick when he rises. When you have bent your necks before him\nand pointed towards him with your fingers his death would occur and would take him away.\nThey would live after him as long as Allah wills, till Allah brings out for you one who would\ncollect you together and fuse you after diffusion.\nDo not place expectations in one who does not(1) come forward and do not lose hope in one\nwho is veiled, because it is possible that one of the two feet of the veiled one may slip while\nthe other may remain sticking, till both return to position and stick.\nBeware! The example of the descendant (Al) of Muhammad - peace and blessing of Allah be\nupon him and his descendants - is like that of stars in the sky. When one star sets another one\nrises. So you are in a position that Allah's blessings on you have been perfected and He has\nshown you what you used to wish for.\n(1). The implication is that if for the time being your expectations are not being fulfilled, you\nshould not be disappointed.\nIt is possible matters may improve, the impediments in the way of improvement may be\nremoved and matters may be settled as you wish."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_101.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_101.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"M6l9wUIy8o"}
