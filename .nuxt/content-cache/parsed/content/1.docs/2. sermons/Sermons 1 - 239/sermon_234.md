This is because they are either from saltish soil or sweet soil or from rugged\nearth or soft earth. They, resemble each other on the basis of the affinity of their soil and\ndiffer according to its difference.\nTherefore, sometimes a person of handsome features is weak in intelligence, a tall statured\nperson is of low courage, a virtuous person is ugly in appearance, a short statured person is\nfar-sighted, a good-natured person has an evil trait, a person of perplexed heart has\nbewildering mind and a sharp-tongued person has a wakeful heart.\n(l). Amir al-mu'minin has ascribed the differences in features and characters of people to the\ndifferences in the clay from which they are created and according to which their features are\nshaped and the skeletons of their characters are formed. Therefore, to the extent that their\nclay of origin is akin, their mental and imaginative tendencies too will be similar and to the\nextent by which they differ, there will be a difference in their inclinations and tendencies.\nBy origins of a thing are meant those things on which its coming into existence depends, but\nthey should not be its cause. The word \"tin\" is the plural of \"tinah\" which means origin or\nbasis. Here \"tinah\" means semen which after passing through various stages of development\nemerges in the human shape. Its origin means those constituents from which those items are\ncreated which help in the formation of semen.\nThus, by saltish, sweet, soft or hard soil the reference is to these elementary constituents.\nSince those elementary constituents carry different properties the semen growing out of them\nwill also bear different characteristics and propensities which will (eventually) show forth in the\ndifferences in features and conduct of those borne in it.\nIbn Abi'l-Hadid has written (in Sharh Nahj al-balaghah, vol. 13, p. 19) that \"origins of tinah\"\nimplies those preservative factors which are different in their properties as Plato and other\nphilosophers have held. The reason for calling them \"origins of tinah\" is that they serve as an\nasylum for the human body and prevent the elements from diffusion.\nJust as the existence of a thing hinges on its basis, in the same way the existence of this body\nwhich is made up of elements depends on preservative factors. So long as the preservative\nfactor exists the body is also safe from disruption and disintegration and the elements too are\nimmune to diffusion and dispersal. When it leaves the body the elements also get dispersed.\nAccording to this explanation Amir al-mu'minin's words would mean that Allah has created\ndifferent original factors among whom some are vicious and some are virtuous, some are weak\nand some are strong, and every person will act according to his original factor. If there is\nsimilarity in the inclinations of two persons it is because their original factor are similar, and if\ntheir tendencies differ it is because their original factors do not have any similarity.\nBut this conclusion is not correct because Amir al-mu'minin's words do not only refer to\ndifferences in conduct and behaviour but also of features and shape and the differences of\nfeatures and shape cannot be the result of differences in original factors.\nIn any case, whether the original factors are the cause of differences in features and conduct\nor the elementary constituents are the cause, these words appear to lead to the negation of\nvolition and to prove the compulsion (of destiny) in human actions, because if man's capacity\nfor thinking and acting is dependent on \"tinah\" then he would be compelled to behave himself\nin a fixed way on account of which he would neither deserve praise for good acts nor be held\nblame worthy for bad habits.\nBut this hypothesis is incorrect because it is well established that just as Allah knows\neverything in creation after its coming into being, in the same way He knew it before its\ncreation. Thus, He knew what actions man would perform of his free will and what he would\nleave.\nTherefore, Allah gave him capacity to act according to his free will, and created him from a\nsuitable \"tinah\". This tinah is not the cause of his actions so as to snatch away from him his\nfree will but the meaning of creating from suitable tinah is that Allah does not by force stand in\nman's way but allows him to tread the path he wants to tread of his own free will."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_234.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_234.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"YydtbTSHCf"}
