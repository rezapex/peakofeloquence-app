See how He chose you for favours and dealt\nwith you with mercy. You sinned openly; He kept you covered. You behaved in a way to\nincur His punishment, but He gave you more time.\nCondition of persons facing death\nI also advise you to remember death and to lessen your heedlessness towards it. Why should\nyou be heedless of Him Who is not heedless of you? Why expect from him (i.e., the angel of\ndeath) who will not give you time? The dead whom you have been watching suffice as\npreachers.\nThey were carried to their graves, not riding themselves, and were placed in them but not of\ntheir own accord. It seems as if they never lived in this world and as if the next world had\nalways been their abode. They have made lonely the place where they were living, and are\nnow living where they used to feel lonely.\nThey remained busy about what they had to leave, and did not care for where they were to go.\nNow they cannot remove themselves from&127; evil, nor add to their virtues They were\nattached to the world and it deceived them. They trusted it and it overturned them.\nTransience of this world\nMay Allah have pity on you. You should therefore hasten towards (the preparation of) houses\nwhich you have been commanded to populate, and towards which you have been called and\ninvited. Seek the completion of Allah's favours on you by exercising endurance in His\nobedience and abstention from His disobedience, because tomorrow is close to today.\nHow fast are the hours of the day, how fast are the days in the month, how fast are the months\nin the years and how fast the years in a life."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":",. .,. ,.\n,. .,. ,.\n,. .,. ,."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_189.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_189.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"ne3hmBkPtZ"}
