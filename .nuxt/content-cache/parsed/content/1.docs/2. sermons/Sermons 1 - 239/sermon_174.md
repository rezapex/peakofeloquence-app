If any mischief is created by a mischief-monger, he will be called upon to repent. If he\nrefuses. he will be fought. By my life, (1) if the question of Imamah was not to be decided\nunless all the people were present, then there would be no such case.\nBut those who agreed about it imposed the decision on those who were absent, so much so\nthat he who was present could not dissent and the one who was absent could not choose (any\none else). Know that I shall fight two persons - one who claims what is not his and the other\nwho ignores what is obligatory upon him.\nThe need for sagacity in fighting against Muslims\nO' creatures of Allah! I advise you to have fear of Allah because it is the best advice to be\nmutually given by persons, and the best of all things before Allah.\nThe door of war has been opened between you and the other Muslims. And this banner will\nbe borne only by him who is a man of sight, of endurance and of knowledge of the position of\nrightfulness.\nTherefore, you should go ahead with what you are ordered and desist from what you are\nrefrained. Do not make haste in any matter till you have clarified it. For in the case of every\nmatter which you dislike we have a right to change it.\nThe behaviour of this world with its adherents\nKnow that this world which you have started to covet and in which you are interested, and\nwhich sometimes enrages you and sometimes pleases you is not your (permanent) abode, nor\nthe place of your stay for which you might have been created, nor one to which you have been\ninvited. Know that it will not last for you nor will you live along with it.\nIf anything out of this world deceives you (into attraction), its evils warn you too. You should\ngive up (the objects of) its deceits in favour of (the objects of) its warning and (the objects of)\nits attractions in favour of (the objects of) its terrors.\nAnd while here in it, advance towards that house to which you have been called, and turn\naway your hearts from the world. None of you should cry like a maid slave over anything\nwhich she has been deprived of.\nSeek the perfection of Allah's bounty over you by endurance in obedience to Allah and in\nguarding what He has asked you to guard, namely His Book.\nKnow that the loss of anything of this world will not harm you, if you have guarded the\nprinciples of your religion. Know also that after the loss of your religion nothing of this world\nfor which you have cared will benefit you. May Allah carry our hearts and your hearts\ntowards the right and may He grant us and you endurance.\n(1).

Therefore, in keeping\nwith the requirements of the situation a reply based on the agreed principles of the adversary\ncould alone quieten him. Even if he had argued on the strength of the Prophet's command it\nwould have been subjected to various interpretations and the matter would have been\nprolonged instead of being settled.\nAgain Amir al-mu'minin had seen that soon after the death of the Prophet all his sayings and\ncommands had been set aside.
