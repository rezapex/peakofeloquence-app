We do not\nknow which of these two was more appropriate.\" Amir al-mu'minin struck one hand over the\nother and said:\nThis is the reward of one who breaks pledge. By Allah, when I gave you my orders (namely)\nto abide by arbitration I had led you to an undesirable thing (namely war) in which Allah had\nordained good. If you had been steadfast I would have guided you, if you had been bent I\nwould have straightened you and if you had refused I would have rectified you. This was the\nsurest way.\nBut with whom and to whom. I wanted my treatment from you but you proved to be my\ndisease, like the extractor of thorn with the thorn when he knows that the thorn bends towards\nitself.\nMy Allah, the physicians have despaired of this fatal ailment and water-drawers have become\ntired with the rope of this well. Where (1) are those who were invited to Islam and they\naccepted it? They read the Qur'an and decided according to it.\nThey were exhorted to fight and they leapt (towards it) as she-camels leap towards their\nyoung. They took their swords out of the sheaths and went out into the world in groups and\nrows. Some of them perished and some survived. The good news of survival does not please\nthem nor do they get condoled about the dead. Their eyes have turned white with weeping.\nTheir bellies are emaciated because of fasting. Their lips are dry because of (constant)\npraying. Their colour is pale because of wakefulness. Their faces bear the dust of Godfearing.\nThese are my comrades who have departed. We should be justified if we feel eager\nfor them and bite our hands in their separation.\nCertainly, Satan has made his ways easy for you and wants to unfasten the knots of religion\none by one and to cause division among you in place of unity. Keep away from his evil ideas\nand enchantments and accept good advice of one who offers it to you and preserve it in your\nminds.\n(1) Although all those who fought under the banner of Amir al-mu'minin were called Shi"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"ahs of "}]},{"type":"text","value":"Ali, yet only those who had tears in their eyes, paleness on their faces, the Qur'anic verses\non their tongues, zeal of religion in their hearts, steadfastness in their feet, determination and\ncourage in their spirits, and patience and endurance in their minds could in true sense he\ncalled Shi"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"ahs of "}]},{"type":"text","value":"AIi.\nThese were the people in whose separation Amir al-mu'minin's feelings were coming out in the\nshape of sighs through the breath, while the flames of the fire of separation were consuming\nhis heart and spirit.
