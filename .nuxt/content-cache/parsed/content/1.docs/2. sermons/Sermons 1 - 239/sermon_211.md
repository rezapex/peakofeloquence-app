If people\nknew that he was a hypocrite and a liar, they would not accept anything from him and would\nnot confirm what he says.\nRather they say that he is the companion of the Prophet, has met him, heard (his sayings)\nfrom him and acquired (knowledge) from him. They therefore accept what he says. Allah too\nhad warned you well about the hypocrites and described them fully to you. They have\ncontinued after the Holy Prophet. They gained positions with the leaders of misguidance and\ncallers towards Hell through falsehoods and slanderings. So, they put them in high posts and\nmade them officers over the heads of the people, and amassed wealth through them.\nPeople are always with the rulers and after this world, except those to whom Allah affords\nprotection. This is the first of the four categories.\nSecond: Those who are mistaken\nThen there is the individual who heard (a saying) from the Holy Prophet but did not memorise\nit as it was, but surmised it. He does not lie wilfully. Now, he carries the saying with him and\nrelates it, acts upon it and claims that: \"I heard it from the Messenger of Allah.\n\" If the Muslims come to know that he has committed a mistake in it, they will not accept it\nfrom him, and if he himself knows that he is on the wrong he will give it up.\nThird: Those who are ignorant\nThe third man is he who heard the Prophet ordering to do a thing and later the Prophet\nrefrained the people from doing it, but this man did not know it, or he heard the Prophet\nrefraining people from a thing and later he allowed it, but this man did not know it.\nIn this way he retained in his mind what had been repealed, and did not retain the repealing\ntradition. If he knew that it had been repealed he would reject it, or if the Muslims knew,\nwhen they heard it from him, that it had been repealed they would reject it.\nFourth: Those who memorise truthfully\nThe last, namely the fourth man, is he who does not speak a lie against Allah or against His\nProphet. He hates falsehood out of fear for Allah and respect for the Messenger of Allah, and\ndoes not commit mistakes, but retains (in his mind) exactly what he heard (from the Prophet),\nand he relates it as he heard it without adding anything or omitting anything.\nHe heard the repealing tradition, he retained it and acted upon it, and he heard the repealed\ntradition and rejected it. He also understands the particular and the general, and he knows the\ndefinite and indefinite, and gives everything its due position.\nThe sayings of the Prophet used to be of two types. One was particular and the other common.\nSometimes a man would hear him but he would not know what Allah, the Glorified, meant by\nit or what the Messenger of Allah meant by it. In this way the listener carries it and\nmemorises it without knowing its meaning and its real intention, or what was its reason.\nAmong the companions of the Messenger of Allah all were not in the habit of putting him\nquestions and ask him the meanings, indeed they always wished that some Bedouin or\nstranger might come and ask him (peace be upon him) so that they would also listen.\nWhenever any such thing came before me, I asked him about its meaning and preserved it.\nThese are the reasons and grounds of differences among the people in their traditions.\n(1). This was Sulaym ibn Qays al-Hilali who was one of the relaters of traditions through Amir\nal-mu'minin. (2). In this sermon Amir al-mu'minin has divided the traditionists into four\ncategories.\nThe first category is that of a man concocts a tradition and attributes it to the Prophet.\nTraditions were in fact falsified and attributed to him, and this process continued, with the\nresult that numerous novel traditions came into being.\nThis is a fact which cannot be denied but if anyone does deny it his basis would be not\nknowledge or sagacity by oratory or argumentative necessity. Thus, once, "},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Alamu'l-huda (Ensign of Guidance) as-Sayyid al-Murtada had a chance of meeting the Sunni "}]},{"type":"text","value":"ulama' (scholars) in confrontation and on this occasion as-Sayyid al-Murtada proved by\nhistorical facts that the traditions related about the merits of the great companions are\nconcocted and counterfeit.\nOn this, the (Sunni) "},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"ulama' argued that it was impossible that someone should dare speak a lie against the Prophet and prepare a tradition himself and attribute it to him. as-Sayyid al- Murtada said there is a tradition of the Prophet that: A lot of false things will be attributed to me after my death and whoever speaks a lie against me would be preparing his abode in Hell. (al-Bukhari, vol.1, p.38; vol.2, p.102; vol.4, p.207; vol.8, p.54; Muslim, vol.8, p.229; Abu Dawud, vol.3, pp.319-320; at-Tirmidhi, vol.4, p.524; vol.5, pp.35-36, 40, 199, 634; Ibn Majah, vol.1, pp.13-15) If you regard this tradition as true then you should agree that false things have been attributed to the Prophet, but if you regard it false, this would prove our point. However, these were people whose hearts were full of hypocrisy and who used to prepare traditions of their own accord in order to create mischief and dispersion in religion and to misguide Muslims of weak convictions. They remained mixed with them as they used to do during the lifetime of the Prophet; and just as they remained busy in activities of mischief and destruction in those days, in the same way, even after the Prophet, they were not unmindful of deforming the teachings of Islam and metamorphosing its features. Rather, in the days of the Prophet they were always afraid lest he unveiled them and put them to shame, but after the Prophet their hypocritical activities increased and they attributed false things to the Prophet without demur for their own personal ends, and those who heard them believed in them because of their status as companions of the Prophet, thinking that whatever they said was correct and whatever they gave out was true. Afterwards also, the belief that all the companions are correct put a stopper on their tongues, as a result of which they were taken to be above criticism, questioning, discussion and censure. Besides, their conspicuous performance had made them prominent in the eyes of the government, and also because of this it needed courage and daring to speak against them. This is proved by Amir al-mu'minin's words: These people gained positions with the leaders of misguidance and callers towards Hell, through falsehood and slanderings. So, they put them in high posts and made them officers over the heads of the people. Along with the destruction of Islam, the hypocrites also aimed at amassing wealth, and they were doing so freely by claiming to be Muslims, because of which they did not want to remove the veil of Islam (from their faces) and to come out openly, but they wanted to continue their Satanic activities under the garb of Islam and engaged themselves in its basic destruction and spreading of division and dispersal by concocting traditions. In this connection, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written: When they were left free they too left many things. When people observed silence about them they also observed silence about Islam, but they continued their underground activities such as the fabrication of falsehoods to which Amir al-mu'minin has alluded, because a lot of untrue matters had been mixed with the traditions by the group of people of wrong beliefs, while some of them also aimed at extolling some particular party with whom they had other worldly aims as well.

The limit was reached when\nthe al-Karramiyyah and some of the al-Mutasawwifah gave the ruling that the fabrication of\ntraditions for the prevention of sin or for persuasion towards obedience was lawful.\nConsequently, in connection with persuading and dissuading, traditions were fabricated quite\nfreely, and this was not regarded against the religious law or morality. Rather, this work was\ngenerally done by those who bore the appearance of asceticism or fear of Allah and who\npassed their nights in praying and days in filling their registers with false traditions. An idea\nabout the number of these fabricated traditions can be had from the fact that out of six\nhundred thousand traditions al-Bukhari selected only two thousand seven hundred and sixtyone\ntraditions, (Tarikh Baghdad, vol.2, p.8; al-Irshad as-sari, vol.1, p.28; Sifatu's-safwah, vol.4,\np.143).

But when this selection is studied some traditions which come across can, in no circumstances, be attributed to the Prophet. The result is that a group of considerable number has cropped up among Muslims who, in view of these (so-called) authoritative collections and true traditions, completely reject the evidentiary value of the traditions, (For further reference see al-Ghadir, vol.5, pp. 208-378). The second category of relaters of traditions are those who, without appreciating the occasion or context, related whatever they could recollect, right or wrong.

Herein the\npermission to visit graves has repealed the previous restriction on it. Now, those who heard\nonly the repealed tradition continued acting according to it.\nThe fourth category of relaters of traditions is of those who were fully aware of the principles\nof justice, possessed intelligence and sagacity, knew the occasion when a tradition was first\nuttered (by the Prophet) and were also acquainted with the repealing and the repealed\ntraditions, the particular and the general, and the timely and the absolute. They avoided\nfalsehood and fabrication. Whatever they heard remained preserved in their memory, and they\nconveyed it with exactness to others.\nIt is they whose traditions are the precious possession of Islam, free from fraud and counterfeit\nand worthy of being trusted and acted upon. That collection of traditions which has been\nconveyed through trustworthy bosoms like that of Amir al-mu'minin and has remained free\nfrom cutting, curtailing, alteration or change particularly present Islam in its true form.
