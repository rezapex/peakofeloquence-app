Hammam was not\nsatisfied with this and pushed him to speak.\nThereupon, Amir al-mu'minin praised Allah and extolled Him and sought His blessings on the\nHoly Prophet and then spoke:\nNow then, Allah the Glorified, the Sublime, created (the things of) creation. He created them\nwithout any need for their obedience or being safe from their sinning, because the sin of\nanyone who sins does not harm Him nor does the obedience of anyone who obeys Him\nbenefit Him.\nHe has distributed among them their livelihood, and has assigned them their positions in the\nworld.\nThus, the God-fearing, in it are the people of distinction. Their speech is to the point, their\ndress is moderate and their gait is humble. They keep their eyes closed to what Allah has\nmade unlawful for them, and they put their ears to that knowledge which is beneficial to them.\nThey remain in the time of trials as though they remain in comfort. If there had not been fixed\nperiods (of life) ordained for each, their spirits would not have remained in their bodies even\nfor the twinkling of an eye because of (their) eagerness for the reward and fear of\nchastisement. The greatness of the Creator is seated in their heart, and, so, everything else\nappears small in their eyes.\nThus to them Paradise is as though they see it and are enjoying its favours. To them, Hell is\nalso as if they see it and are suffering punishment in it.\nTheir hearts are grieved, they are protected against evils, their bodies are thin, their needs are\nscanty, and their souls are chaste. They endured (hardship) for a short while, and in\nconsequence they secured comfort for a long time. It is a beneficial transaction that Allah\nmade easy for them. The world aimed at them, but they did not aim at it.\nIt captured them, but they freed themselves from it by a ransom.\nDuring a night they are upstanding on their feet reading portions of the Qur'an and reciting it\nin a well-measured way, creating through it grief for themselves and seeking by it the cure for\ntheir ailments. If they come across a verse creating eagerness (for Paradise) they pursue it\navidly, and their spirits turn towards it eagerly, and they feel as if it is in front of them.\nAnd when they come across a verse which contains fear (of Hell) they bend the ears of their\nhearts towards it, and feel as though the sound of Hell and its cries are reaching their ears.\nThey bend themselves from their backs, prostrate themselves on their foreheads, their palms,\ntheir knees and their toes, and beseech Allah, the Sublime, for their deliverance. During the\nday they are enduring, learned, virtuous and God-fearing. Fear (of Allah) has made them thin\nlike arrows. If any one looks at them he believes they are sick, although they are not sick, and\nhe says that they have gone mad.\nIn fact, great concern (i.e., fear) has made them mad.\nThey are not satisfied with their meagre good acts, and do not regard their major acts as great.\nThey always blame themselves and are afraid of their deeds. When anyone of them is spoken\nof highly, he says: \"I know myself better than others, and my Lord knows me better than I\nknow. O' Allah do not deal with me according to what they say, and make me better than they\nthink of me and forgive me (those shortcomings) which they do not know.\"\nThe peculiarity of anyone of them is that you will see that he has strength in religion,\ndetermination along with leniency, faith with conviction, eagerness in (seeking) knowledge in\nforbearance, moderation in riches, devotion in worship, gracefulness in starvation, endurance\nin hardship, desire for the lawful, pleasure in guidance and hatred from greed. He performs\nvirtuous deeds but still feels afraid. In the evening he is anxious to offer thanks (to Allah). In\nthe morning his anxiety is to remember (Allah).\nHe passes the night in fear and rises in the morning in joy - fear lest night is passed in\nforgetfulness, and joy over the favour and mercy received by him. If his self refuses to endure\na thing which it does not like he does not grant its request towards what it likes.\nThe coolness of his eye lies in what is to last for ever, while from the things (of this world)\nthat will not last he keeps aloof. He transfuses knowledge with forbearance, and speech with\naction.\nYou will see his hopes simple, his shortcomings few, his heart fearing, his spirit contented,\nhis meal small and simple, his religion safe, his desires dead and his anger suppressed. Good\nalone is expected from him. Evil from him is not to be feared. Even if he is found among\nthose who forget (Allah) he is counted among those who remember (Him), but if he is among\nthe rememberers he is not counted among the forgetful. He forgives him who is unjust to him,\nand he gives to him who deprives him. He behaves well with him who behaves ill with him.\nIndecent speech is far from him, his utterance is lenient, his evils are non-existent his virtues\nare ever present, his good is ahead and mischief has turned its face (from him). He is dignified\nduring calamities, patient in distresses, and thankful during ease.\nHe does not commit excess over him whom he hates, and does not commit sin for the sake of\nhim whom he loves. He admits truth before evidence is brought against him. He does not\nmisappropriate what is placed in his custody, and does not forget what he is required to\nremember.\nHe does not call others bad names, he does not cause harm to his neighbour, he does not feel\nhappy at others misfortunes, he does not enter into wrong and does not go out of right.\nIf he is silent his silence does not grieve him, if he laughs he does not raise his voice, and if he\nis wronged he endures till Allah takes revenge on his behalf. His own self is in distress\nbecause of him, while the people are in ease from him. He puts himself in hardship for the\nsake of his next life, and makes people feel safe from himself.\nHis keeping away from others is by way of asceticism and purification, and his nearness to\nthose to whom he is near is by way of leniency and mercifulness. His keeping away is not by\nway of vanity or feeling of greatness, nor his nearness by way of deceit and cheating.\nIt is related that Hammam passed into a deep swoon and then expired. Then Amir almu'minin\nsaid: Verily, by Allah I had this fear about him. Then he added: Effective advices\nproduce such effects on receptive minds. Someone (2) said to him: O' Amir al-mu'minin, how\nis it you do not receive such an effect? Amir al-mu'minin replied: Woe to you. For death there\nis a fixed hour which cannot be exceeded, and a cause which does not change. Now look,\nnever repeat such talk which Satan had put on your tongue.\n(1).
