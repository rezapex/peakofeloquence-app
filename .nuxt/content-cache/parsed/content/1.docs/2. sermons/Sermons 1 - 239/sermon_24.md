Satan has certainly started instigating his forces and has collected his army in order that oppression may reach its extreme ends and wrong may come back to its position. By Allah they have not put a correct blame on me, nor have they done justice between me and themselves. They are demanding of me a right which they have abandoned, and a blood that they have themselves shed.(1) If I were a partner with them in it then they too have their share of it. But if they did it without me they alone have to face the consequences. Their biggest argument (against me) is (really) against themselves. They are suckling from a mother who is already dry, and bringing into life innovation that is already dead. How disappointing is this challenger (to battle)? Who is this challenger and for what is he being responded to? I am happy that the reasoning of Allah has been exhausted before them and He knows (all) about them. The threat to Wage War against them If they refuse (to obey) I will offer them the edge of the sword which is enough a curer of wrong and supporter of Right. It is strange they send me word to proceed to them for spear-fighting and to keep ready for fighting with swords. May the mourning women mourn over them.

Nor\ncan they falsify witnessed events by saying that they were unconcerned with it. Why then have\nthey put me foremost for this avenging? With me they should include themselves also.\nIf I am free of this blame they cannot establish their freedom from it. How can they detach\nthemselves from this punishment? The truth of the matter is that by accusing me of this\ncharge their aim is that I should behave with them in the same manner to which they are\naccustomed. But they should not expect from me that I would revive the innovations of the\nprevious regimes.\nAs for fighting, neither was I ever afraid of it nor am I so now. Allah knows my intention and\nHe also knows that those standing on the excuse of taking revenge are themselves his\nassassins.\" Thus, history corroborates that the people who managed his ("},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Uthman's) assassination by agitation and had even prevented his burial in Muslims' graveyard by hurling stones at his coffin were the same who rose for avenging his blood.
