Do not tear away\nyour curtain before Him Who is aware of your secrets.\nTake away from this world your hearts before your bodies go out of it, because herein you\nhave been put on trial, and you have been created for the other world. When a man dies\npeople ask what (property) he has left while the angels ask what (good actions) he has sent\nforward.
