It has dignified minarets, bright\nhighways, burning laps, prestigious field of activity, and high objective. It has a collection of\nrace horses. It is approached eagerly. Its riders are honourable.\nTestimony (of Allah, Prophet etc.) is its way, good deeds are its minarets, death is its\nextremity, this world is its race-course, the Day of Judgement is its horses and Paradise is its\npoint of approach.\nA part of the same sermon about the Holy Prophet\nThe Prophet lighted flames for the seeker and put bright signs for the impeded. So he is Thy\ntrustworthy trustee, Thy witness on the Day of Judgement, Thy deputy as a blessing and Thy\nmessenger of truth as mercy. My Allah distribute to him a share from Thy Justice and award\nhim multiples of good by Thy bounty.\nMy Allah heighten his construction over the constructions of others, honour him when he\ncomes to Thee, dignify his position before Thee, give him honourable position, and award\nhim glory and distinction, and bring us out (on the Day of Judgement) among his party,\nneither ashamed, nor repentant, nor deviators, nor pledge-breakers, nor strayers, nor\nmisleaders. nor seduced.\nas-Sayyid ar-Radi says: This sermon had already appeared earlier but we have repeated it here\nbecause of the difference between the two versions.\nA part of the same sermon addressed to his followers\nBy bounty of Allah over you, you have acquired a position where even your slave maids are\nhonoured, your neighbours are treated well. Even he over whom you enjoy no distinction or\nobligation honours you. Even those people fear you who had no apprehension of attack from\nyou or any authority over you. You now see pledges to Allah being broken but do not feel\nenraged although you fret and frown on the breaking of the traditions of your forefathers.\nAllah's matters have been coming to you, and going from and again coming back to you; but\nyou have made over your place to wrong-doers and thrown towards them your\nresponsibilities, and have placed Allah's affairs in their hands.\nThey act in doubts and tread in (fulfilment of) desires. By Allah, even if they disperse you\nunder every star Allah would surely collect you on the day that would be worst for them."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_107.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_107.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"e8xOP5UbbF"}
