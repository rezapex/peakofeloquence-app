Grit your teeth because\nthis will make the swords skip off the skull, and dodge on the sides of the spears for it\nchanges the direction of their blades. Close the eyes because it strengthens the spirit and gives\npeace to the heart. Kill the voices because this will keep off spiritlessness .\nDo not let your banner bend down, nor leave it alone. Do not give it to anyone except the\nbrave and the defenders of honour among you because they alone endure the befalling of\ntroubles; they surround the banners and encircle them on both sides, their rear and their front.\nThey do not separate from them lest they give them over (to the enemy). They do not go\nahead of them lest they leave them alone.\nEveryone should deal with his adversary and also help his comrade by his own life, and\nshould not leave the adversary to his comrade lest both his own adversary and his comrade\njoin against him.\nBy Allah, even if you run away from the sword of today you would not remain safe from the\nsword of the next world. You are the foremost among the Arabs and great figures. Certainly\nin running away there is the wrath of Allah, unceasing disgrace and lasting shame.\nAnd certainly a runner-away does not lengthen his life, nor does any thing come to intervene\nbetween him and his day (of death).\nWho is there to go towards Allah like the thirsty going to the water? Paradise lies under the\nedges of spears. Today the reputations (about the valour of warriors) will be tested.\nBy Allah! I am more eager to meet them (in combat) than they are for (returning to) their\nhouses. O' my Allah! If they reject truth disperse their group, divide their words (opinion) and\ndestroy them on account of their sins.\nThey will not budge from their stand till the continuous striking of spears causes piercings (of\nwounds) through which wind may pass, and the hitting of swords cuts through the skull,\ncleaves bones and breaks forearms and legs, till they are attacked by contingent after\ncontingent and assaulted by detachments which are followed by reserves for support, till their\ncities are continuously assailed by force after force, and till the horses trample even the\nextreme ends of the lands, the tracks of their beast and their meadows.\nas-Sayyid ar-Radi says: \"ad-da"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"q\" means trampling, e.g., \"taduqqu'l-khuyulu bihawafiriha ardahum\" (the horses trample the ground with their hoofs). \"nawahini ardihim\" means lands opposite each other, it is said, \"manazilu bani fulanin tatanaharu\" meaning the 'houses of soand- so are opposite each other.'

Signs of defeat appeared on the Syrians,\nand they were about to leave the battlefield and run away, when five hundred\nQur'ans were raised on spears changing the entire face of the battle. Moving swords stopped,\nthe weapon of deceit was successful, and the way was clear for wrong to hold its sway.\nIn this battle forty-five thousand Syrians were killed while twenty-five thousand Iraqis fell as\nmartyrs.
