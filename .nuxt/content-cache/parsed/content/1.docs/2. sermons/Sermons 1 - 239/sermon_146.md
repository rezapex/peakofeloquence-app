With every drinking there\nis choking and with every eating there is suffocation. You do not get any benefit in it except\nby foregoing another (benefit) and no one among you advances in age by a day except by the\ntaking away of a day from his life.\nNothing more is added to his eating unless it reduces what was there before. No mark appears\nfor him unless a mark disappears.\nNothing new comes into being unless the new becomes old. No new crop comes up unless a\ncrop has been reaped. Those roots are gone whose off-shoots we are. How can an off-shoot\nlive after the departure of its root?\nA part of the same sermon on innovation (bid`ah)\nNo innovation is introduced unless one sunnah is forsaken, keep away from innovations and\nstick to the broad road.
