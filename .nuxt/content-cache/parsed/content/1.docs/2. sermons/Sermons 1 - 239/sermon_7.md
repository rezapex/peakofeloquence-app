He\nhas laid eggs and hatched them in their bosoms. He creeps and crawls in their laps. He sees\nthrough their eyes, and speaks with their tongues.\nIn this way he has led them to sinfulness and adorned for them foul things like the action of\none whom Satan has made partner in his domain and speaks untruth through his tongue.\n(1). Amir al-mu'minin says about the hypocrites (i.e. those who opposed him before and\nduring his Caliphate) that they are partners in action of Satan and his helpers and supporters.\nHe too has befriended them so much that he has made his abode with them, resides on their\nbosoms, lays eggs and hatches young one from them there, while these young ones jump and\nplay in their laps without demur. He means that Satanic evil ideas take birth in their bosoms\nand grow and thrive there.\nThere is no restrain on them, nor restriction of any kind. He has so permeated in their blood\nand mingled in their spirit that both have become completely unified. Now eyes are theirs but\nsight is his, the tongue is theirs but the words are his, as the Prophet had said, \"Verily, Satan\npermeates the progeny of Adam like blood.\" That is, just as the circulation of blood does not\nstop, in the same way the quick succession of Satan's evil ideas know no break and he draws\nman towards evil in sleep and wakefulness, and in every posture, rising or sitting.\nHe so paints them with his dye that their word and action reflect an exact portrait of his word\nand action. Those whose bosoms shine with the effulgence of faith prevent such evil ideas but\nsome are already ready to welcome those evils and these are the persons who under the garb\nof Islam are ever after advancement of heresy."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":",. .,. ,.\n,. .,. ,.\n,. .,. ,."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_7.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_7.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"eYfJmCWKxC"}
