I invoke His help being in need of His Sufficiency (of\nprotection).\nHe whom He guides does not get astray, He with whom He is hostile gets no protection. He\nwhom He supports does not remain needy. Praise is most weighty of all that is weighed and\nthe most valuable of all that is treasured.\nI stand witness that there is no god but Allah the One. He has no like. My testimony has been\ntested in its frankness, and its essence is our belief. We shall cling to it for ever till we live\nand shall store it facing the tribulations that overtake us because it is the foundation stone of\nBelief (iman) and the first step towards good actions and Divine pleasure. It is the means to\nkeep Satan away.\nI also stand witness that Muhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.p.) is His slave and His Prophet. Allah sent\nhim with the illustrious religion, effective emblem, written Book,(1) effulgent light, sparkling\ngleam and decisive injunction in order to dispel doubts, present clear proofs, administer\nwarning through signs and to warn of punishments. At that time people had fallen in vices\nwhereby the rope of religion had been broken, the pillars of belief had been shaken, principles\nhad been sacrileged, system had become topsy turvy, openings were narrow, passage was\ndark, guidance was unknown and darkness prevailed.\nAllah was being disobeyed, Satan was given support and Belief had been forsaken. As a result\nthe pillars of religion fell down, its traces could not be discerned, its passages had been\ndestroyed and its streets had fallen into decay. People obeyed Satan and treaded his paths.\nThey sought water from his watering places. Through them Satan's emblems got flying and\nhis standard was raised in vices which trampled the people under their hoofs, and treaded\nupon them with their feet. The vices stood on their toes (in full stature) and the people\nimmersed in them were strayed, perplexed, ignorant and seduced as though in a good house\n(2) with bad neighbours. Instead of sleep they had wakefulness and for antimony they had\ntears in the eyes. They were in a land where the learned were in bridle (keeping their mouths\nshut) while the ignorant were honoured.\nIn the same sermon Amir al-mu'minin referred to Al an-Nabi (the Household of the Holy\nProphet) as under:\nThey are the trustees of His secrets, shelter for His affairs, source of knowledge about Him,\ncentre of His wisdom, valleys for His books and mountains of His religion. With them Allah\nstraightened the bend of religion's back and removed the trembling of its limbs.\nIn the same Sermon he spoke about the hypocrites\nThey sowed vices, watered them with deception and harvested destruction.\n(Alu Muhammad)\nNone in the Islamic community can be taken at par with the Progeny(3) of the Prophet (Alu\nMuhammad). One who was under their obligation cannot be matched with them. They are the\nfoundation of religion and pillar of Belief.\nThe forward runner has to turn back to them while the follower has to overtake them. They\npossess the chief characteristics for vicegerency. In their favour exists the will and succession\n(of the Prophet). This is the time when right has returned to its owner and diverted to its\ncentre of return.\n(1). The Preserved Record.\n(2). Good House means 'Mecca' while the bad neighbours mean the 'Unbelievers of Quraysh.'\n(3). About the Progeny of the Prophet Amir al-mu'minin has said that no person in the world\ncan be brought at par with them, nor can any one be deemed their equal in sublimity, because\nthe world is overladen with their obligations and has been able to secure eternal blessings only\nthrough their guidance. They are the corner stone and foundation of religion and the\nsustenance for its life and survival.\nThey are such strong pillars of knowledge and belief that they can turn away the stormy flow\nof doubt and suspicion. They are such middle course among the paths of excess and\nbackwardness that if some one goes far towards excess and exaggeration or falls behind then\nunless he comes back or steps forward to that middle course he cannot be on the path of\nIslam.\nThey possess all the characteristics which give the superiority in the right for vicegerency and\nleadership. Consequently, no one else in the ummah enjoys the right of patronage and\nguardianship. That is why the Prophet declared them his vicegerents and successors. About will\nand succession the commentator Ibn Abi'l-Hadid Mu"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"tazili writes that there can be no doubt about the vicegerency of Amir al-mu'minin but succession cannot imply succession in position although the Shi"}]},{"type":"text","value":"ite sect has so interpreted it.\nIt rather implies succession of learning. Now, if according to him succession is taken to imply\nsuccession in learning even he does not seem to succeed in achieving his object, because even\nby this interpretation the right of succeeding the Prophet does not devolve on any other\nperson. When it is agreed that learning is the most essential requirement of khilafah (caliphate)\nbecause the most important functions of the Prophet's Caliph consist of dispensation of justice,\nsolving problems of religious laws, clarifying intricacies and administration of religious\npenalties. If these functions are taken away from the Prophet's deputy his position will come\ndown to that of a worldly ruler.\nHe cannot be regarded as the pivot of religious authority. Therefore either we should keep\ngovernmental authority separate from Prophet's vicegerency or accept the successor of\nProphet's knowledge to suit that position. The interpretation of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid could be\nacceptable if Amir al-mu'minin had uttered this sentence alone, but observing that it was\nuttered soon after `Ali's (p.b.u.h.) recognition as Caliph and just after it the sentence \"Right\nhas returned to its owner\" exists, this interpretation of his seems baseless. Rather, the\nProphet's will cannot imply any other will except that for vicegerency and caliphate, and\nsuccession would imply not succession in property nor in knowledge because this was not an\noccasion to mention it here but it must mean the succession in the right leadership which stood\nproved as from Allah not only on the ground of kinship but on the ground of qualities of\nperfection."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_2.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_2.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"bacjbw0ppw"}
