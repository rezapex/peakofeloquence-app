He\nis the First, such that nothing was before Him.\nHe is the Last, such that there is not limit for Him. Imagination cannot catch any of His\nqualities. Hearts cannot entertain belief about His nature. Analysis and division cannot be\napplied to Him. Eyes and hearts cannot compare Him.\nA part of the same sermon\nO' creatures of Allah! take lesson from useful items of instruction and shining indications. Be\ncautioned by effective items of warning. Get benefit from preaching and admonition.\nIt is as though the claws of death are pressed in you, the connection of hope and desires has\nbeen cut asunder, hard affairs have befallen you and your march is towards the place where\neveryone has to go, namely death.\nHence, \"with every person there is a driver and a witness\" (Qur'an, 50:21). The driver drives\nhim towards resurrection while the witness furnishes evidence about his deeds.\nA part of the same sermon (about Paradise)\nIn Paradise there are high classes and different places of stay. Its boundary never ends. He\nwho stays in it will never depart from it. He who is endowed with everlasting abode in it will\nnot get old, and its resident will not face want."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_86.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_86.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"OsMLzQIddT"}
