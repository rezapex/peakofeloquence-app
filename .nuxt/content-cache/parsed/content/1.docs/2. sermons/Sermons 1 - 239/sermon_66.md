Everyone called one\n(alone) save Him is by virtue of being small (in number); and everyone enjoying honour other\nthan Him is humble.\nEvery powerful person other than Him is weak. Every master (owner) other than Him is slave\n(owned).\nEvery knower other than Him is seeker of knowledge. Every controller other than Him is\nsometimes imbued with control and sometimes with disability. Every listener other than Him\nis deaf to light voices while loud voices make him deaf and distant voices also get away from\nhim. Every onlooker other than Him is blind to hidden colours and delicate bodies.\nEvery manifest thing other than Him is hidden, but every hidden thing other than Him is\nincapable of becoming manifest.\nHe did not create what He created to fortify His authority nor for fear of the consequences of\ntime, nor to seek help against the attack of an equal or a boastful partner or a hateful\nopponent. On the other hand all the creatures are reared by him and are His humbled slaves.\nHe is not conditioned in anything so that it be said that He exists therein, nor is He separated\nfrom anything so as to be said that He is away from it. The creation of what He initiated or the\nadministration of what He controls did not fatigue Him.\nNo disability overtook Him against what He created. No misgiving ever occurred to Him in\nwhat He ordained and resolved. But His verdict is certain, His knowledge is definite, His\ngovernance is overwhelming. He is wished for at time of distress and He is feared even in\nbounty."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":",. .,. ,.\n,. .,. ,.\n,. .,. ,."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_66.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_66.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"746JTZRhlI"}
