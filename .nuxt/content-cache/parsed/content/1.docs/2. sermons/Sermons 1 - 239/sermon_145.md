He made them as pleas\nfor Him among His creation, so that there should not remain any excuse for people. He\ninvited people to the right path through a truthful tongue.\nYou should know that Allah fully knows creation. Not that He was not aware of what they\nconcealed from among their hidden secrets and inner feelings, but in order to try them as to\nwhom from among them performs good acts, so that there is reward in respect of good acts\nand chastisement in respect of evil acts.\nThe position of Ahlu'l-bayt (the Household of the Holy Prophet)\nWhere are those who falsely and unjustly claimed that they are deeply versed in knowledge,\nas against us, although Allah raised us in position and kept them down, bestowed upon us\nknowledge but deprived them, and entered us (in the fortress of knowledge) but kept them out.\nWith us guidance is to be sought and blindness (of misguidance) is to be changed into\nbrightness. Surely Imams (divine leaders) will be from the Quraysh. They have been planted\nin this line through Hashim. It would not suit others nor would others be suitable as heads of\naffairs.\nA part of the same sermon about those who are against the Ahlu'l-bayt\nThey have adopted this world and abandoned the next world; left clean water and drunk\nstinking water. I can almost see their wicked one (1) who committed unlawful acts, associated\nhimself with them, befriended them and accorded with them till his hair grew grey and his\nnature acquired their tinge. He proceeded onward emitting foam like a torrential stream not\ncaring whom he drowned, or, like fire in straw, without realising what he burnt.\nWhere are the minds which seek light from the lamps of guidance, and the eyes which look at\nminarets of piety? Where are the hearts dedicated to Allah, and devoted to the obedience of\nAllah? They are all crowding towards worldly vanities and quarrelling over unlawful issues.\nThe ensigns of Paradise and Hell have been raised for them but they have turned their faces\naway from Paradise and proceeded to Hell by dint of their performances.\nAllah called them but they showed dislike and ran away. When Satan called them they\nresponded and proceeded (towards him).\n(1). Here the reference is to `Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan who committed extreme atrocities\nthrough his officer al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath-Thaqafi."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_145.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_145.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"NYJdbNUqRD"}
