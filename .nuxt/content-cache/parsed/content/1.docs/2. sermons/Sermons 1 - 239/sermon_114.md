It is not a house for foraging. It has\ndecorated itself with deception and deceives with its decoration. It is a house which is low\nbefore Allah. So He has mixed its lawful with its unlawful, its good with its evil, its life with\nits death, and its sweetness with its bitterness.\nAllah has not kept it clear for His lovers, nor has He been niggardly with it towards His foes.\nIts good is sparing. Its evil is ready at hand. Its collection would dwindle away.\nIts authority would be snatched away. Its habitation would face desolation. What is the good\nin a house which falls down like fallen construction or in an age which expires as the\nprovision exhausts, or in time which passes like walking?\nInclude whatever Allah has made obligatory on you in your demands. Ask from Him\nfulfilment of what He has asked you to do. Make your ears hear the call of death before you\nare called by death.\nSurely the hearts of the abstemious weep in this world even though they may (apparently)\nlaugh, and their grief increases even though they may appear happy. Their hatred for\nthemselves is much even though they may be envied for the subsistence they are allowed.\nRemembrance of death has disappeared from your hearts while false hopes are present in you.\nSo this world has mastered you more than the next world, and the immediate end (of this\nworld) has removed you away from the remote one (of the next life). You are brethren in the\nreligion of Allah. Dirty natures and bad conscience have separated you. Consequently you do\nnot bear burdens of each other nor advise each other, nor spend on each other, nor love each\nother.\nWhat is your condition? You feel satisfied with what little you have secured from this world\nwhile much of the next world of which you have been deprived does not grieve you. The little\nof this world which you lose pains you so much so that it becomes apparent in your faces, and\nin the lack of your endurance over whatever is taken away from you; as though this world is\nyour permanent abode, and as though its wealth would stay with you for good.\nNothing prevents anyone among you to disclose to his comrade the shortcomings he is afraid\nof, except the fear that the comrade would also disclose to him similar defects. You have\ndecided together on leaving the next world and loving this world. Your religion has become\njust licking with the tongue. It is like the work of one who has finished his job and secured\nsatisfaction of his master."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_114.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_114.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"uRKSaHiQ5z"}
