So if any one of you observes\nfor his brother plenty of progeny or of wealth or of self, it should not be a worry for him.\nSo long as a Muslim does not commit such an act that if it is disclosed he has to bend his eyes\n(in shame) and by which low people are emboldened, he is like the gambler who expects that\nthe first draw of his arrow would secure him gain and also cover up the previous loss.\nSimilarly, the Muslim who is free from dishonesty expects one of the two good things: either\ncall from Allah and in that case whatever is with Allah is the best for him, or the livelihood of\nAllah. He has already children and property while his faith and respect are with him.\nCertainly, wealth and children are the plantations of this world while virtuous deed is the\nplantation of the next world. Sometimes Allah joins all these in some groups.\nBeware of Allah against what He has cautioned you and keep afraid of Him to the extent that\nno excuse be needed for it. Act without show or intention of being heard, for if a man acts for\nsome one else then Allah makes him over to that one. We ask Allah (to grant us) the positions\nof the martyrs, company of the virtuous and friendship of the prophets.\nO' people! surely no one (even though he may be rich) can do without his kinsmen, and their\nsupport by hands or tongues. They alone are his support from rear and can ward off from him\nhis troubles, and they are the most kind to him when tribulations befall him. The good\nmemory of a man that Allah retains among people is better than the property which others\ninherit from him.\nIn the same sermon\nBehold! If any one of you finds your near ones in want or starvation, he should not desist\nfrom helping them with that which will not increase if this help is not extended, nor decrease\nby thus spending it. Whoever holds up his hand from (helping) his kinsmen, he holds only\none hand, but at the time of his need many hands remain held up from helping him. One who\nis sweet tempered can retain the love of his people for good.\nas-Sayyid ar-Radi says: In this sermon \"al-ghafirah\" means plenty or abundance, and this is\nderived from the Arab saying, \"al-jamm al-ghafir\" or \"al-jamma' al-ghafir\" meaning thick\ncrowd.
