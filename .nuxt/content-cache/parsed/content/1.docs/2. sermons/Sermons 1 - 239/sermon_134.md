The thriving trees bow to Him in the morning and evening, and\nproduce for Him flaming fire from their branches, and at His command, turn their own feed\ninto ripe fruits.\nA part of the same sermon about the Holy Qur'an\nThe Book of Allah is among you. It speaks and its tongue does not falter. It is a house whose\npillars do not fall down, and a power whose supporters are never routed.\nA part of the same sermon about the Holy Prophet\nAllah deputised the Prophet after a gap from the previous prophets when there was much talk\n(among the people). With him Allah exhausted the series of prophets and ended the\nrevelation. He then fought for Him those who were turning away from Him and were\nequating others with Him.\nA part of the same sermon about this world\nCertainly this world is the end of the sight of the (mentally) blind who see nothing beyond it.\nThe sight of a looker (who looks with the eye of his mind) pierces through and realises that\nthe (real) house is beyond this world. The looker therefore wants to get out of it while the\nblind wants to get into it. The looker collects provision from it (for the next world) while the\nblind collects provision for this very world.\nA part of the same sermon - A caution\nYou should know that a man gets satiated and wearied with everything except life, because he\ndoes not find for himself any pleasure in death. It is in the position of life for a dead heart,\nsight for the blind eye, hearing for the deaf ear, quenching for the thirsty and it contains\ncomplete sufficiency and safety.\nThe Book of Allah is that through which you see, you speak and you hear. Its one part speaks\nfor the other part, and one part testifies to the other. It does not create differences about Allah\nnor does it mislead its own follower from (the path of) Allah.\nYou are joined together in hatred of each other and in the growing of herbage on your filth (i.\ne., for covering inner dirt by good appearance outside). You are sincere with one another in\nyour love of desires and bear enmity against each other in earning wealth. The evil spirit\n(Satan) has perplexed you and deceit has misled you. I seek the help of Allah for myself and\nyou."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_134.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_134.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"boHqp23eRn"}
