In order to make the bitterness of the admonition palatable Amir al-mu'minin adopted that way of speech in the beginning which would create a sense of responsibility in the addressee and direct him towards his obligations. Thus, by mentioning his companionship of the Prophet, his personal position, and his kinship to the Prophet as against the two previous Caliphs, his intention was to make him realise his duties; in any case, this was obviously not an occasion for eulogising him, so that its later portion can be disregarded and the whole speech be regarded as an eulogy of his attainments, because from its very beginning it is evident that whatever "}]},{"type":"text","value":"Uthman did, he did it wilfully, that\nnothing was done without his knowledge or his being informed, and that he could not be held\nunaccountable for it because of his being unaware of it.\nIf the adoption of a line of action which made the whole Islamic world raise hue and cry in\nspite of his having being a companion of the Prophet, having heard his instructions, having\nseen his behaviour and having been acquainted with the commandments of Islam can be\nregarded as a distinction, then this taunt may also be regarded as praise.\nIf that is not a distinction then this too cannot be called and eulogy. In fact, the words about\nwhich it is argued that they are in praise are enough to prove the seriousness of his crime,\nbecause a crime in ignorance and unawareness is not so serious as the weight given to the\nseriousness of the commission of a crime despite knowledge and awareness.\nConsequently a person who is unaware of the rise and fall of a road and stumbles in the dark\nnight is excusable but a person who is aware of the rise and fall of the road and stumbled in\nbroad day light is liable to be blamed.\nIf on this occasion he is told that he has eyes and is also aware of the rise and fall of the way,\nit would not mean that his vastness of knowledge or the brightness of his eye-sight is being\npraised, but the intention would be that he did not notice the pitfalls despite his eyes, and did\nnot walk properly, and that therefore for him, having or not having eyes is the same, and\nknowing or not knowing is equal.\nIn this connection great stress in laid on his being a son-in-law, namely that the Prophet\nmarried his two daughters Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthum to him one after the other.
