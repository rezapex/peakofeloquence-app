(Mind) the obligations (mind) the\nobligations. Fulfil them for Allah and they will take you to Paradise.\nSurely, Allah has made unlawful the things which are not unknown and made lawful the\nthings which are without defect. He has declared paying regard to Muslims as the highest of\nall regards.\nHe has placed the rights of Muslims in the same grade (of importance) as devotion (to\nHimself and His oneness). Therefore, a Muslim is one from whose tongue and hand every\n(other) Muslim is safe save in the matter of truth. It is not, therefore, lawful to molest a\nMuslim except when it is obligatory.\nHasten towards the most common matter which is peculiar to every one; and that is death.\nCertainly, people (who have already gone) are ahead of you while the hour (Day of\nJudgement) is driving you from behind. Remain light, in order that you may overtake them.\nYour backs are being awaited for the sake of the fronts. Fear Allah in the matter of His\ncreatures and His cities because you will be questioned even about lands and beasts.\nObey Allah and do not disobey Him. When you see virtue adopt it, and when you see vice\navoid it."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_168.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_168.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"2NQ0XtxwvU"}
