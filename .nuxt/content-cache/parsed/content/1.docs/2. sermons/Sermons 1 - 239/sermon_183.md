Amir al-mu'minin had a woollen apparel on his body, the belt of his sword was made of\nleaves, and the sandals on his feet too were of palm leaves. His forehead had a hardened spot\nlike that a camel (on its knee, due to many and long prostrations).\nAbout Allah's attributes, His creatures and His being above physical limitations\nPraise be to Allah to Whom is the return of all creation and the end of all matters. We render\nHim praise for the greatness of His generosity, the charity of His proofs, the increase of His\nbounty and His favours, - praise which may fulfil His right, repay His thanks, take (us) near\nHis reward and be productive of increase in His kindness. We seek His help like one who is\nhopeful of His bounty, desirous of His benefit, and confident of His warding off (calamities),\nwho acknowledges His gifts and is obedient to Him in word and deed.\nWe believe in Him like him who reposes hope in Him with conviction, inclines to Him as a\nbeliever, humbles himself before Him obediently, believes in His oneness exclusively,\nregards Him great, acknowledging His dignity, and seeks refuge with Him with inclination\nand exertion.\nAllah the Glorified has not been born so that someone could be (His) partner in glory. Nor has\nHe begotten anyone so as to be inherited from after dying. Time and period have not preceded\nHim. Increase and decrease do not occur to Him. But He has manifested Himself to our\nunderstanding through our having observed His strong control and firm decree.\nAmong the proofs of His creation is the creation of the skies which are fastened without\npillars and stand without support. He called them and they responded obediently and humbly\nwithout being lazy or loathsome. If they had not acknowledged His Godhead and obeyed Him\nHe would not have made them the place for His throne, the abode of His angels and the\ndestination for the rising up of the pure utterances and the righteous deeds of the creatures.\nHe has made the stars in the skies by way of signs by which travellers wandering the various\nroutes of the earth may be guided. The gloom of the dark curtains of the night does not\nprevent the flame of their light, nor do the veils of blackish nights have the power to turn back\nthe light of the moon when it spreads in the skies. Glory be to Allah from Whom neither the\nblackness of dark dusk or of gloomy night (falling) in the low parts of the earth or on high\ndim mountains is hidden, nor the thundering of clouds on the horizons of the skies, nor the\nsparking of lightning in the clouds, nor the falling of leaves blown away from their falling\nplaces by the winds of hurricanes or by downpour from the sky. He knows where the drops\nfall and where they stay, where the grubs leave their trails or where they drag themselves,\nwhat livelihood would suffice the mosquitoes and what a female bears in its womb.\nPraise be to Allah Who exists from before the coming into existence of the seat, the throne,\nthe sky, the earth, the jinn or human being. He cannot be perceived by imagination nor\nmeasured by understanding. He who begs from Him does not divert Him (from others), nor\ndoes giving away cause Him diminution. He does not see by means of an eye, nor can He be\nconfined to a place. He cannot be said to have companions. He does not create with (the help\nof) limbs. He cannot be perceived by senses. He cannot be thought of after the people.\nIt is He who spoke to Musa clearly and showed him His great signs without the use of bodily\nparts, the organ of speech or the uvula. O' you who exert yourself in describing Allah if you\nare serious then (first try to) describe Gabriel, Michael or the host of angels who are close (to\nAllah) in the receptacles of sublimity; but their heads are bent downwards and their wits are\nperplexed as to how to assign limits (of definition) to the Highest Creator. This is because\nthose things can only be perceived through qualities which have shape and parts and which\nsuccumb to death after reaching the end of their times. There is no god but He. He has lighted\nevery darkness with His effulgence and has darkened every light with the darkness (of death).\nAn account of past peoples and about learning from them\nI advise you, creatures of Allah, to practise fear of Allah Who gave you good clothing and\nbestowed an abundance of sustenance on you. If there was anyone who could secure a ladder\nto everlasting life or a way to avoid death it was Sulayman ibn Dawud (p. b. u. h. ) who was\ngiven control over the domain of the jinn and men along with prophethood and great position\n(before Allah), but when he finished what was his due in food (of this world) and exhausted\nhis (fixed) time the bow of destruction shot him with arrow of death. His houses became\nvacant and his habitations became empty. Another group of people inherited them. Certainly,\nthe by-gone centuries have a lesson for you.\nWhere are the Amalekites (1) and the sons of Amalekites? Where are the Pharaohs? (2)\nWhere are the people of the cities of ar-Rass (3) who killed the prophets, destroyed the\ntraditions of the divine messengers and revived the traditions of the despots? Where are those\nwho advanced with armies, defeated thousands, mobilised forces and populated cities?\nA part of the same sermon about the Imam al-Mahdi\nHe will be wearing the armour of wisdom, which he will have secured with all its conditions,\nsuch as full attention towards it, its (complete) knowledge and exclusive devotion to it. For\nhim it is like a thing which he had lost and which he was then seeking, or a need which he\nwas trying to fulfil. If Islam is in trouble he will feel forlorn like a traveller and like a (tired)\ncamel beating the end of its tail and with its neck flattened on the ground. He is the last of\nAllah's proofs and one of the vicegerents of His prophets.\nThen Amir al-mu'minin continued:\nOn the method of his ruling, and grief over the martyrdom of his companions\nO' people! I have divulged to you advice which the prophets used to preach before their\npeoples, and I have conveyed to you what the vicegerents (of the prophets) conveyed to those\ncoming after them. I tried to train you with my whip but you could not be straightened. I\ndrove you with admonition but you did not acquire proper behaviour. May Allah deal with\nyou! Do you want an Imam other than me to take you on the (right) path, and show you the\ncorrect way?\nBeware, the things in this world which were forward have become things of the past, and\nthose of which were behind are going ahead. The virtuous people of Allah have made up their\nminds to leave and they have purchased, with a little perishable (pleasure) of this world, a lot\nof such (reward) in the next world that will remain.\nWhat loss did our brothers whose blood was shed in Siffin suffer by not being alive today?\nOnly that they are not suffering choking on swallowings and not drinking turbid water. By\nAllah, surely they have met Allah and He has bestowed upon them their rewards and He has\nlodged them in safe houses after their (having suffered) fear.\nWhere are my brethren who took the (right) path and trod in rightness.

Then Amir al-mu'minin wiped his hand over his auspicious, honoured beard and wept for a long time, then he continued: Oh! my brothers. who recited the Qur'an and strengthened it, thought over their obligation and fulfilled it, revived the sunnah and destroyed innovation. When they were called to jihad they responded and trusted in their leader then followed him. Then Amir al-mu'minin shouted at the top of his voice: al-jihad, al-jihad (fighting, fighting), O' creatures of Allah! By Allah, I am mobilising the army today.

Consequently,\nthe armies came back and were left like sheep who had lost their shepherd while wolves were\nsnatching them away from all sides.\n(1). History shows that very often the ruin and destruction of peoples has been due to their\noppression and open wickedness and profligacy. Consequently, communities which had\nextended their sway over all the corners of the populated world and had flown their flags in the\nEast and West of the globe disappeared from the surface of the earth like a wrong word, on\ndisclosure of their vicious actions and evil doings. Amalekites: ancient nomadic tribe, or\ncollection of tribes, described in the Old Testament as relentless enemies of Israel, even\nthough they were closely related to Ephraim, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Their name\nderives from Amalek, who is celebrated in Arabian tradition but cannot be identified. The\ndistrict over which they ranged was south of Judah and probably extended into northern Arabia.\nThe Amalekites harassed the Hebrews during their exodus out of Egypt and attacked them at\nRephidim (near Mt. Sinai), where they were defeated by Joshua. They also filled out the ranks\nof the nomadic raiders defeated by Gideon and were condemned to annihilation by Samuel.\nThe Amelekites, whose final defeat occurred in the time of Hezekiah, were the object of a\nperpetual curse.

Pharaoh: Hebrew form of the Egyptian per-'o (\"the great house\"), signifying the royal\npalace, an epithet applied in the New Kingdom and after, as a title of respect, to the Egyptian\nking himself. In the 22nd dynasty the title was added to the king's personal name.\nIn official documents the full titulary of the Egyptian king contained five names. The first and\noldest identified him as the incarnation of the falcon god, Horus; it was often written inside a\nsquare called serekh, depicting the facade of the archaic palace. The second name, \"two\nladies\", placed him under the protection of Nekhbet and Buto, the vulture and uraeus (snake)\ngoddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt; the third, \"golden Horus\", signified perhaps originally\n\"Horus victorious over his enemies.\" The last two names, written within a ring or cartouche,\nare generally referred to as the praenomen and nomen, and were the ones most commonly\nused; the praenomen and nomen, and were the ones most commonly used; the praenomen,\npreceded by the hieroglyph meaning \"King of Upper and Lower Egypt,\" usually contained a\nreference to the king's Unique relationship with the sun god, Re, while the fifth, or nomen, was\npreceded by the hieroglyph for \"Son of Re,\" or by that for \"Lord of the two lands.\n\" The last name was given him at birth, the rest at his coronation.

His pride, egotism,\ninsolence and haughtiness were such that by making the claim \"I am your sublime God\" he\ndeemed himself to be holding sway over all other powers of the world, and was under the\nmisunderstanding that no power could wrest the realm and government from his hands. The\nQur'an has narrated his claim of \"I and no one else\" in the following words:\nAnd proclaimed Pharaoh unto his people, \"O' my people! is not the kingdom of\nEgypt mine? And these rivers flow below me; What! behold ye not? (43:51)\nBut when his empire came near the end it was destroyed in a few moments. Neither his\nposition and servants could come in the way of its destruction nor could the vastness of his\nrealm prevent it. Rather, the waves of the very streams which he was extremely proud to\npossess, wrapped him in and dispatched his spirit to Hell throwing the body on the bank to\nserve as a lesson for the whole of creation.\n(3).
