The cause of the battle of Nahrawan was that when after Arbitration Amir al-mu'minin was\nreturning to Kufah, the people who were foremost in pleading acceptance of Arbitration began\nto say that appointment of anyone other than Allah as arbitrator is heresy, and that, Allah\nforbid, by accepting the Arbitration Amir al-mu'minin turned heretic.\nConsequently, by distorting the meaning of \"There is no authority same with Allah\" they made\nsimple Muslims share their views and separating from Amir al-mu'minin encamped at Hanira'\nnear Kufah.\nWhen Amir al-mu'minin learned of these plottings he sent Sa"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"sa"}]},{"type":"text","value":"ah ibn Suhan al-"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Abdi and Ziyad ibn an-Nadr al-Harithi in the company of Ibn "}]},{"type":"text","value":"Abbas towards them and afterwards\nhimself went to the place of their stay and dispersed them after discussion.\nWhen these people reached Kufah they began to spread the news that Amir al-mu'minin had\nbroken the agreement of Arbitration and that he is again ready to fight against the Syrians.\nWhen Amir al-mu'minin learned this he contradicted it whereupon these people stood up in\nrebellion and encamped twelve miles from Baghdad in the low area of the canal called\nNahrawan.\nOn the other side, after hearing the verdict of Arbitration Amir al-mu'minin rose for fighting the\narmy of Syria and wrote to the Kharijites that the verdict passed by the two arbitrators in\npursuance of their heart's wishes instead of the Qur'an and sunnah was not acceptable to him,\nthat he had therefore decided to fight with them and they should support him for crushing the\nenemy. But the Kharijites gave him this reply, \"When you had agreed to Arbitration in our view\nyou had turned heretic.\nNow if you admit your heresy and offer repentance we will think over this matter and decide\nwhat we should do.\" Amir al-mu'minin understood from their reply that their disobedience and\nmisguidance had become very serious. To entertain any kind of hope from them now was futile.\nConsequently, ignoring them he encamped in the valley of an-Nukhaylah with a view to\nmarching towards Syria. When the army had been arrayed he came to know that the men\ndesired to deal with the people of Nahrawan first, and to move towards Syria afterwards. Amir\nal-mu'minin, however, said that they should be left as they were, that they themselves should\nfirst move towards Syria while the people of Nahrawan could be dealt with afterwards.\nPeople said that they were prepared to obey every order of his with all their might whether he\nmoved this way or that way.\nThe army had not moved when news about the rebellion of Kharijites began to reach, and it\nwas learnt that they had butchered the governor of Nahrawan namely "},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Abdullah ibn Khabbab ibn al-Aratt and his slave maid with the child in her womb, and have killed three women of Banu Tayyi and Umm Sinan as-Saydawiyyah.

When their rebellion reached this stage it\nwas necessary to deal with them. Consequently, the army turned towards Nahrawan.\nOn reaching there Amir al-mu'minin sent them word that those who had killed `Abdullah ibn\nKhabbab ibn al-Aratt and innocent women should be handed over to him for avenging blood.\nThose people replied that they had killed these persons jointly and that they considered it\nlawful to shed the blood of all the people on his side. Even at this Amir al-mu'minin did not\ntake the initiative for the battle, but sent Abu Ayyub al-Ansari with a message of peace.\nSo he spoke to them aloud, \"Whoever comes under this banner or separates from that party\nand goes to Kufah or al-Mada'in would get amnesty and he would not be questioned. As a\nresult of this Farwah ibn Nawfal al-Ashja'i said that he did not know why they were at war with\nAmir al-mu'minin.\nSaying this he separated along with five hundred men. Similarly group after group began to\nseparate and some of them joined Amir al-mu'minin.\nThose who remained numbered four thousand, and according to at-Tabari's account they\nnumbered two thousand eight hundred.\nThese people were not in any way prepared to listen to the voice of truth, and were ready to\nkill or be killed. Amir al-mu'minin had stopped his men to take the initiative but the Kharijites\nput arrows in their bows and broke and threw away the sheathes of their swords. Even at this\njuncture Amir al-mu'minin warned them of the dire consequences of war and this sermon is\nabout that warning and admonition. But they were so brimming with enthusiasm that they\nleapt on Amir al-mu'minin's force all of a sudden.\nThis onslaught was so severe that the foot men lost ground but they soon fixed themselves\nfirmly that the attack of arrows and spears could not dislodge them from their position and\nthey soon so cleared away the Kharijites that except for nine persons who fled away to save\ntheir lives not a single person was left alive. From Amir al-mu'minin's army only eight persons\nfell as martyrs.\nThe battle took place on the 9th Safar, 38 A.H."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_38.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_38.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"biNsYVRc9q"}
