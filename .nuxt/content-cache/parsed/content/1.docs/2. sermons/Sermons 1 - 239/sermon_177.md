Seek benefit from the sayings of Allah, be admonished of Allah and accept\nthe advice of Allah because Allah has left no excuse for you by providing clear guidance, has\nput before you the plea and clarified for you what acts He likes and what acts He hates, so\nthat you may follow the one and avoid the other. The Prophet of Allah used to say. \"Paradise\nis surrounded by unpleasant things while Hell is surrounded by desires.\"\nYou should know that every obedience to Allah is unpleasant in appearance while every\ndisobedience to Allah has the appearance of enjoyment. Allah may have mercy on the person\nwho kept aloof from his desire and uprooted the appetite of his heart, because this heart has\nfar-reaching aims and it goes on pursuing disobedience through desires.\nYou should know, O' creatures of Allah, that a believer should be distrustful of his heart every\nmorning and evening. He should always blame it (for shortcomings) and ask it to add to (its\ngood acts). You should behave like those who have gone before you and the precedents in\nfront of you. They left this world like a traveller and covered it as distance is covered.\nThe greatness of the Holy Qur'an\nAnd know that this Qur'an is an adviser who never deceives, a leader who never misleads and\na narrator who never speaks a lie. No one will sit beside this Qur'an but that when he rises he\nwill achieve one addition or one diminution - addition in his guidance or elimination in his\n(spiritual) blindness. You should also know that no one will need anything after (guidance\nfrom) the Qur'an and no one will be free from want before (guidance from) the Qur'an.\nTherefore, seek cure from it for your ailments and seek its assistance in your distresses. It\ncontains a cure for the biggest diseases, namely unbelief, hypocrisy, revolt and misguidance.\nPray to Allah through it and turn to Allah with its love. Do not ask the people through it.\nThere is nothing like it through which the people should turn to Allah, the Sublime.\nKnow that it is an interceder and its intercession will be accepted. It is a speaker who is\ntestified. For whoever the Qur'an intercedes on the Day of Judgement, its intercession for him\nwould be accepted. He about whom the Qur'an speaks ill on the Day of Judgement shall\ntestify to it.\nOn the Day of Judgement an announcer will announce, \"Beware. every sower of a crop is in\ndistress except the sowers of the Qur'an.\" Therefore, you should be among the sowers of the\nQur'an and its followers. Make it your guide towards Allah. Seek its advice for yourselves, do\nnot trust your views against it. and regard your desires in the matter of the Qur'an as deceitful.\nAbout the believers and their good deeds; and the hypocrites and their bad deeds\nAction! action! Then (look at) the end; the end, and (remain) steadfast; steadfast. Thereafter\n(exercise) endurance, endurance, and piety, piety. You have an objective. Proceed towards\nyour objective. You have a sign. Take guidance from your sign. Islam has an objective.\nProceed towards its objective. Proceed towards Allah's by fulfilling His rights which He has\nenjoined upon you. He has clearly stated His demands for you. I am a witness for you and\nshall plead excuses on your behalf on the Day of Judgement.\nBeware! what had been ordained has occurred and that which had been destined has come\ninto play. I am speaking to you with the promise and pleas of Allah.\nAllah the Sublime, has said:\nVerily, those who say: Our Lord is Allah! and persevere aright, the angels descend upon them\n(saying): \"Fear Ye not, nor be grieved, and receive the glad tidings of the Garden which Ye\nwere promised.\" (Qur'an, 41:30)\nYou have said. \"Our Lord is Allah.\" Then keep steadfast to His Book, to the way of His\ncommand and to the virtuous course of His worship. Thereafter do not go out of it, do not\nintroduce innovations in it, and do not turn away from it, because those who go away from\nthis course will be cut off from (the mercy of) Allah on the Day of Judgement.\nBeware from destroying your manners and changing them, maintaining one tongue. A man\nshould control his tongue because the tongue is obstinate with its master. By Allah, I do not\nfind that fear of Allah benefits a man who practises it unless he controls his tongue.\nCertainly the tongue of a believer is at the back of his heart while the heart of a hypocrite is at\nthe back of his tongue; because, when a believer intends to say anything, he thinks it over in\nhis mind. If it is good he discloses it, but if it is bad he lets it remain concealed. While a\nhypocrite speaks whatever comes to his tongue, without knowing what is in his favour and\nwhat goes against him.\nThe Prophet of Allah - peace and blessing of Allah be upon him and his descendants - said:\n\"The belief of a person cannot be firm unless his heart is firm, and his heart cannot be firm\nunless his tongue is firm.\" So whoever of you can manage to meet Allah, the Sublime, in such\na position that his hands are unsmeared with the blood of Muslims and their property and his\ntongue is safe from exposing them, he should do so.\nFollowing the sunnah and refraining from innovation\nKnow, O' creatures of Allah, that a believer should regard lawful this year what he regarded\nlawful in the previous year, and should consider unlawful this year what he considered\nunlawful in the previous year. Certainly people's innovation cannot make lawful for you what\nhas been declared unlawful; rather, lawful is that which Allah has made lawful and unlawful\nis that which Allah has made unlawful. You have already tested the matters and tried them;\nyou have been preached by those before you. Illustrations have been drawn for you and you\nhave been called to clear fact. Only a deaf man can remain deaf to all this, and only a blind\nman can remain blind to all this.\nHe whom Allah does not allow benefit from trials and experience cannot benefit from\npreaching. He will be faced with losses from in front, so that he will approve what is bad and\ndisapprove what is good. People are of two categories - the follower of the shari`ah (religious\nlaws), and the follower of the innovations to whom Allah has not given any testimony by way\nof sunnah or the light of any plea.\nGuidance from the Holy Qur'an\nAllah the Glorified, has not counselled anyone on the lines of this Qur'an, for it is the strong\nrope of Allah and His trustworthy means. It contains the blossoming of the heart and springs\nof knowledge. For the heart there is no other gloss than the Qur'an although those who\nremembered it have passed away while those who forgot or pretended to have forgotten it\nhave remained. If you see any good give your support to it, but if you see evil evade it,\nbecause the Messenger of Allah used to say: \"O' son of Adam, do good and evade evil; by\ndoing so you will be treading correctly.\"\nCategories of oppression\nKnow that injustice is of three kinds - one, the injustice that will not be forgiven, another, that\nwill not be left unquestioned, and another that will be forgiven without being questioned. The\ninjustice that will not be forgiven is duality of Allah. Allah has said: Verily Allah forgiveth\nnot that (anything) be associated with Him ... (Qur'an, 4:48,116).\nThe injustice that will be forgiven is the injustice a man does to himself by committing small\nsins; and the injustice that will not be left unquestioned is the injustice of men against other\nmen. The retribution in such a case is severe. It is not wounding with knives, nor striking with\nwhips, but it is so severe that all these things are small against it.\nYou should therefore avoid change in the matter of Allah's religion for your unity in respect\nof a right which you dislike is better than your scattering away in respect of a wrong that you\nlike. Certainly, Allah the Glorified has not given any person, whether among the dead or\namong those who survive, any good from separation.\nO' people, blessed is the man whose own shortcomings keep him away from (looking into)\nthe shortcomings of others, and also blessed is the man who is confined to his house, eats his\nmeal, buries himself in obeying his Allah. and weeps over his sins, so that he is engaged in\nhimself and people are in safety from him."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_177.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_177.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"tSoELrcS62"}
