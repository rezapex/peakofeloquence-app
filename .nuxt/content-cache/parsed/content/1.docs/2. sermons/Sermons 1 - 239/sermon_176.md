How is it that I see you becoming removed from Allah\nand becoming interested in others? You are like the camel whom the grazer drives to a\ndisease-stricken pasture and a disastrous watering place.\nThey are like beasts who are fed in order to be slaughtered, but they do not know what is\nintended for them. When they are treated well they think that day to be their whole life, and\neating their full to be their aim.\nBy Allah, if I wish, I can tell every one of you from where he has come, where he has to go\nand all his affairs, but I fear lest you abandon the Messenger of Allah - peace and blessing of\nAllah be upon him and his progeny - in my favour. I shall certainly convey these things to the\nselected ones who will remain safe from that fear.\nBy Allah, Who deputed the Prophet with Right and distinguished him over creation. I do not\nspeak save the truth. He (the Prophet) informed me of all this and also about the death of\nevery one who dies, the salvation of every one who is granted salvation, and the consequences\nof this matter (the caliphate).\nHe left nothing (that could) pass into my head without putting it in my ear and telling me\nabout it. (1)\nO' people ! By Allah, I do not impel you to any obedience unless I practise it before you and\ndo not restrain you from any disobedience unless I desist from it before you.\n(1). Those who drink from the springs of revelation and divine inspiration see things hidden\nbehind the curtains of the unknown and the events which will occur in the future in the same\nway as objects can be seen with the eyes, and this does not conflict with the saying of Allah\nthat:\nSay: \"None (either) in the heavens or in the earth knoweth the unseen save Allah...\" (Qur'an,\n27:65)\nbecause this verse contains the negation of personal knowledge of the unknown, but not the\nnegation of knowledge which is required by the prophets and holy persons through divine\ninspiration, by virtue of which they make prophesies about the future and unveil many events\nand happenings.\nSeveral verses of the Qur'an support this view such as:\nWhen the Prophet confided unto one of his wives a matter, but when she divulged it (unto\nothers) and Allah apprised him thereof, he made known a part of it and avoided a part; so\nwhen he informed her of it, said she: \"Who informed thee of this?\" He said: \"Informed me, the\nAll-knowing, the All-aware.\" (Qur'an, 66:3)\nThese are of the tidings of the unseen which We reveal unto thee (O' Our Prophet\nMuhammad )...(Qur'an, 11:49)\nTherefore, it is incorrect to argue in support of the view that if it is said that the prophets and\nholy persons possess knowledge of the unknown it would imply duality in the divine attributes.\nIt would have implied duality if it were said that someone other than Allah has personal\nknowledge of the unknown.\nWhen it is not so and the knowledge possessed by the Prophets and Imams is that given by\nAllah it has no connection with duality. If duality should mean what is alleged, what would be\nthe position of "},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Isa's (Jesus's) assertion related in the Qur'an namely: . . .

(Qur'an, 3 :49) If it is believed that "}]},{"type":"text","value":"Isa (Jesus) could create and bestow life with Allah's permission does it\nmean that he was Allah's partner in the attributes of creation and revival? If this is not so then\nhow can it be held that if Allah gives someone the knowledge of the unknown it implies that he\nhas been taken to be His partner in His attributes, and how can one extol one's belief in the\noneness of Allah by holding that the knowledge of the unknown implies duality.\nNo one can deny the fact that some people either see in dreams certain things which have yet\nto occur in the future, or that things can be read through interpretation of the dream, while\nduring a dream neither do the senses function nor do the powers of understanding and\ncomprehension co-operate.\nTherefore, if some events become known to some people in wakefulness why should there be\namazement over it and what are the grounds for rejecting it, when it stands to reason that\nthings possible in dreams are also possible in wakefulness.\nThus, Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani has written that it is possible to achieve all this, because in a\ndream the spirit becomes free from looking after the body and is removed from bodily\nconnections; as a result of this it perceives such hidden realities which could not be seen\nbecause of the obstruction of the body.\nIn the same way those perfect beings who pay no heed to bodily matters, and turn with all the\nattention of spirit and heart towards the centre of knowledge can see those realities and\nsecrets which the ordinary eyes are unable to discern. Therefore, keeping in view the spiritual\ngreatness of Ahlu'l-bayt (members of the Prophet's family) it should not appear strange that\nthey were aware of events which were going to occur in future. Ibn Khaldun has written:\n\"When thaumaturgic feats are performed by others what do you think about those who were\ndistinguished in knowledge and honesty and were a mirror of the Prophet's traits, while the\nconsideration Allah had for their noble root (namely the Prophet) is a proof of the high\nperformances of his chaste off-shoots (Ahlu'l-bayt). Consequently many events about\nknowledge of the unknown are related about Ahlu'l-bayt which are not related about\nothers..\" (al-Muqaddamah, p. 23).\nIn this way there is no cause for wonder over Amir al-mu'minin's claim since he was brought\nup by the Prophet and was a pupil of Allah's school. Of course, those whose knowledge does\nnot extend beyond the limits of physical objectivity and whose means of learning are confined\nto the bodily senses refuse to believe in the knowledge about the paths of divine cognisance\nand reality.\nIf this kind of claim were unique and were heard only from over Amir al-mu'minin then minds\ncould have wavered and temperaments could have hesitated in accepting it, but if the Qur'an\nrecords even such a claim of "},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Isa (Jesus) that - \"I can tell you what you eat or drink or store in your houses,\" then why should there be hesitation over Amir al-mu'minin's claim, when it is agreed that Amir al-mu'minin had succeeded to all the attainments and distinctions of the Prophet and it cannot be contended that the Prophet did not know what "}]},{"type":"text","value":"Isa (Jesus) knew.\nThus, if the successor of the Prophet advances such a claim, why should it be rejected,\nparticularly as this vastness of knowledge of Amir al-mu'minin is the best evidence and proof\nfor the Prophet's knowledge and perfection and a living miracle of his truthfulness.\nIn this connection, it is amazing that even having knowledge of events Amir al-mu'minin did\nnot, through any of his words or deeds, indicate that he knew them. Thus, commenting of the\nextraordinary importance of this claim, as-Sayyid Ibn Tawus writes:\n\"An amazing aspect of this claim is that despite the fact that Amir al-mu'minin was aware of\nconditions and events, yet he observed such conduct by way of his words and deeds that one\nwho saw him could not believe that he knew the secrets and unknown acts of others, because\nthe wise agree that if a person knows what event is likely to take place or what step his\ncomrade is going to take, or if the hidden secrets of people are known to him, then the effects\nof such knowledge would appear through his movements and the expressions of his face.\nBut the man who, in spite of knowing everything, behaves in a way as though he is unaware\nand knows nothing, then his personality is a miracle and a combination of contradictions.\"\nAt this stage, the question arises as to why Amir al-mu'minin did not act upon the dictates of\nhis secret knowledge. The reply to this is that the commands of the shari"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"ah are based on apparent conditions. Otherwise secret knowledge is a kind of miracle and power which Allah grants to His prophets and Imams. Although the prophets and Imams possess this power always, they cannot make use of it at any time unless and until by the permission of Allah and on the proper occasion. For example, the verse quoted above about "}]},{"type":"text","value":"Isa (Jesus) which tells that he had the power to give life, to\nheal the blind and declare what one ate and stored in his house, etc., he (Jesus) did not used\nto practise this power on every thing or every corpse or everyone who met him.\nHe used to practise this power only by the permission of Allah and on the proper occasion.\nIf prophets and other divines acted on the basis of their secret knowledge it would have meant\nserious dislocation and disturbance in the affairs of the people.\nFor example, if a prophet or divine, on the basis of his secret knowledge, punishes a\ncondemnable man by killing him, there would be great commotion and agitation among those\nwho see it on the ground that he killed an innocent man.\nThat is why Allah has not permitted the basing of conclusions on secret knowledge save in a\nfew special cases, and has enjoined the following of observable factors. Thus, despite his being\naware of the hypocrisy of some of the hypocrites, the Prophet extended to them the treatment\nthat should be extended to a Muslim.\nNow, there can be no scope for the objection that if Amir al-mu'minin knew secret matters\nthen why did he not act according to them because it has been shown that he was not obliged\nto act according to the requirements of his secret knowledge.\nOf course, where conditions so required he did disclose some matters for the purposes of\npreaching, admonishing, giving good tidings (of reward) or warning (against punishment), so\nthat future events could be fore-closed.\nFor example, Imam Ja"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"far as-Sadiq (p.b.u.h.) informed Yahya ibn Zayd that if he went out he would be killed.

For example, he warned his cousin Yahya ibn Zayd of\nbeing killed but he disobeyed him and went out and was killed in Juzajan.\" (al-Muqaddamah, p.\n233).\nNevertheless, where there was apprehension that minds would get worried it was not at all\ndisclosed. That is why in this sermon Amir al-mu'minin avoided more details, in view of the fear\nthat people would begin to regard him higher than the Prophet. Despite all this people did go\nastray about `Isa (Jesus), and in the same way about Amir al-mu'minin also they began to say\nall sorts of things and were misled into resorting to exaggeration."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_176.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_176.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"owHEmyI9HE"}
