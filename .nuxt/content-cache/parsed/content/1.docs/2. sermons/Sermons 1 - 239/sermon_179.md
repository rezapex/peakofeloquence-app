The number of\ndrops of water, of stars in the sky, or of currents of winds in the air are not unknown to Him,\nnor the movements of ants on rocks, or the resting place of grubs in the dark night.\nHe knows the places where leaves fall, and the secret movements of the pupils of the eyes.\nI stand witness that there is no god but Allah, Who has no parallel, Who is not doubted,\nWhose religion is not denied and Whose creativeness is not questioned.\nMy witnessing is like that of a man whose intention is free, whose conscience is clear, whose\nbelief is pure and whose loads (of good actions) are heavy. I also stand witness that\nMuhammad - the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his progeny - is His slave and\nHis Messenger, chosen from His creations, selected for detailing His realities, picked for His\nselected honours and chosen for His esteemed messages. Through him the signs of guidance\nhave been lighted and the gloom of blindness (misguidance) has been dispelled.\nO' people, surely this world deceives him who longs for it and who is attracted towards it. It\ndoes not behave niggardly with him who aspires for it and overpowers him who overpowers\nit. By Allah, no people are deprived of the lively pleasures of life after enjoying them, except\nas a result of sins committed by them, because certainly Allah is not unjust to His creatures.\nEven then, when calamities descend upon people and pleasures depart from them, they turn\ntowards Allah with true intention and the feeling in their hearts that He will return them\neverything that has fled from them and cure all their ills.\nI fear about you lest you fall into ignorance (that prevailed before the appearance of the\nProphet). In the past there were certain matters in which you were deflected, and in my view\nyou were not worthy of admiration; but if your previous position could be returned to you\nthen you would become virtuous. I can only strive; but if I were to speak I would (only) say\nmay Allah forgive your past actions."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_179.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_179.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"iTwCVaBV6z"}
