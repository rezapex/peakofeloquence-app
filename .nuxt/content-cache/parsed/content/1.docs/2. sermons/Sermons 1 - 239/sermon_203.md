O' Prophet of Allah, my patience about your chosen\n(daughter) has been exhausted, and my power of endurance has weakened, except that I have\nground for consolation in having endured the great hardship and heart-rending event of your\nseparation. I laid you down in your grave when your last breath had passed (when your head\nwas) between my neck and chest.\n... Verily we are Allah's and verily unto Him shall we return. (Qur'an 2:156)\nNow. the trust has been returned and what had been given has been taken back. As to my\ngrief, it knows no bounds, and as to my nights. they will remain sleepless till Allah chooses\nfor me the house in which you are now residing.\nCertainly, your daughter would apprise you of the joining together of your (1) ummah\n(people) for oppressing her. You ask her in detail and get all the news about the position. This\nhas happened when a long time had not elapsed and your remembrance had not disappeared.\nMy salam (salutation) be on you both, the salam of a grief stricken not a disgusted or hateful\nperson; for if I go away it is not because I am weary (of you), and if I stay it is not due to lack\nof belief in what Allah has promised the endurers.\n(1). The treatment meted out to the daughter of the Prophet after his death was extremely\npainful and sad. Although Sayyidatu'n-nisa' Fatimah (p.b.u.h.) did not live in this world more\nthan a few months after the death of the Prophet yet even this short period has a long tale of\ngrief and woe (about her).\nIn this connection, the first scene that strikes the eyes is that arrangements for the funeral\nrites of the Prophet had not yet been made when the contest for power started in the Saqifah\nof Banu Sa`idah. Naturally, their leaving the body of the Prophet (without burial) must have\ninjured Sayyidatu'n-nisa' Fatimah's grief-stricken heart when she saw that those who had\nclaimed love and attachment (with the Prophet) during his life became so engrossed in their\nmachinations for power that instead of consoling his only daughter they did not even know\nwhen the Prophet was given a funeral ablution and when he was buried, and the way they\ncondoled her was that they crowded at her house with material to set fire to it and tried to\nsecure allegiance by force with all the display of oppression, compulsion and violence.\nAll these excesses were with a view to so obliterate the prestigious position of this house that it\nmight not regain its lost prestige on any occasion. With this aim in view, in order to crush her\neconomic position, her claim for (the estate of) Fadak was turned down by dubbing it as false,\nthe effect of which was that Sayyidatu'n-nisa' Fatimah (p.b.u.h.) made the dying will that none\nof them should attend her funeral."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_203.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_203.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"cvYJiPQwha"}
