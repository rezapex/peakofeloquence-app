He is Allah, the True, the Manifester of Truth. He is\nmore True and more Manifest than eyes can see.\nIntellects cannot comprehend Him by fixing limits for Him since in that case to Him would be\nattributed shape. Imagination cannot catch Him by fixing quantities for Him for in that case to\nHim would be attributed body. He created creatures without any example, and without the\nadvice of a counsel, or the assistance of a helper. His creation was completed by His\ncommand, and bowed to His obedience. It responded (to Him) and did not defy (Him). It\nobeyed and did not resist.\nAn example of His delicate production, wonderful creation and deep sagacity which He has\nshown us is found in these bats which keep hidden in the daylight although daylight reveals\neverything else, and are mobile in the night although the night shuts up every other living\nbeing; and how their eyes get dazzled and cannot make use of the light of the sun so as to be\nguided in their movements and so as to reach their known places through the direction\nprovided by the sun.\nAllah has prevented them from moving in the brightness of the sun and confined them to their\nplaces of hiding instead of going out at the time of its shining. Consequently they keep their\neyelids down in the day and treat night as a lamp and go with its help in search of their\nlivelihood.\nThe darkness of night does not obstruct their sight nor does the gloom of darkness prevent\nthem from movement. As soon as the sun removes its veil and the light of morning appears,\nand the rays of its light enter upon the lizards in their holes, the bats pull down their eyelids\non their eyes and live on what they had collected in the darkness of the night. Glorified is He\nwho has made the night as day for them to seek livelihood and made the day for rest and stay.\nHe has given them wings of flesh with which, at the time of need they rise upwards for flying.\nThey look like the ends of ears without feathers or bones. Of course, you can see the veins\nquite distinctly. They have two wings which are neither too thin so that they get turned in\nflying, nor too thick so that they prove heavy. When they fly, their young ones hold on to\nthem and seek refuge with them, getting down when they get down and rising up when they\nrise.\nThe young does not leave them till its limbs become strong, its wings can support it for rising\nup, and it begins to recognise its places of living and its interest. Glorified is He who creates\neverything without any previous sample by someone else."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_156.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_156.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"EGWPaFDcvq"}
