With its help the seeker succeeds and he who\nmakes for safety escapes and achieves his aims.\nPerform (good) acts while such acts are being raised (in value), repentance can be of benefit,\nprayer can be heard, conditions are peaceful and the pens (of the two angels) are in motion (to\nrecord the actions).\nHasten towards (virtuous) actions before the change of age (to oldness), lingering illness or\nsnatching death (overtakes you). Certainly, death will end your enjoyments, mar your\npleasures and remove your objectives.\nIt is an unwanted visitor, an invincible adversary and an unaccounting killer. Its ropes have\nentrapped you, its evils have surrounded you, its arrowheads have aimed at you, its sway over\nyou is great, its oppression on you is continuous and the chance of its missing you is remote.\nVery soon you will be overwhelmed with the gloom of its shades, the severity of its illness,\nthe darkness of its distresses, the nonsense utterances of its pangs, the grief of its destruction,\nthe darkness of its encompassment and the unwholesomeness of its taste.\nIt will seem as if it has come to you all of a sudden, silenced those who were whispering to\nyou, separated your group, destroyed your doings, devastated your houses and altered your\nsuccessors to distribute your estate among the chief relatives, who did not give you any\nbenefit, or the grieved near ones who could not protect (you), or those rejoicers who did not\nlament (you).\nTherefore, it is upon you to strive, make effort, equip yourself, get ready and provide yourself\nfrom the place of provision. And let not the life of this world deceive you as it deceived those\nbefore you among the past people and by-gone periods -- those who extracted its milk,\nbenefited from its neglectfulness, passed a long time and turned its new things into old (by\nliving long). Their abodes turned into graves and their wealth into inheritable estate.\nThey do not know who came to them (at their graves); do not pay heed to those who weep\nover them, and do not respond to those who call them. Therefore, beware of this world as it is\ntreacherous, deceitful and cheating, it gives and takes back, covers with clothes and uncovers.\nIts pleasure does not last, its hardship does not end and its calamity does not stop.\nA part of the same sermon about ascetics\nThey are from among the people of this world but are not its people, because they remain in it\nas though they do not belong to it. They act herein on what they observe and hasten here in\n(to avoid) what they fear. Their bodies move among the people of the next world. They see\nthat the people of this world attach importance to the death of their bodies but they\nthemselves attach more importance to the death of the hearts of those who are living."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_230.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_230.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"cPc657ZTA4"}
