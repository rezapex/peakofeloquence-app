Rather in this army of ours even those persons were also present\nwho are still in the loins of men and wombs of women. Shortly, time will bring them out and\nfaith will get strength through them.\n(1). If a person falls short in his actions despite means and equipment, this would be indicative\nof the weakness of his will.\nBut if there is an impediment in the way of action or his life comes to an end as a result of\nwhich his action remains incomplete, then in that case Allah would not deprive him of the\nreward on the basis that actions are judged by intention. Since his intention in any case was to\nperform the action, therefore he should deserve reward to some extent.\nIn the case of action, there may be absence of reward because action can involve show or\npretence but intention is hidden in the depth of heart.\nIt can have not a jot of show or affectation. The intention would remain at the same level of\nfrankness, truth, perfection and correctness where it is, even though there may be no action\ndue to some impediment.\nEven if there is no occasion for forming intention but there is passion and zeal in the heart, a\nman would deserve reward on the basis of his heart's feelings. This is to what Amir al-mu'minin\nhas alluded in this sermon, namely that \"If your brother loved me he would share the reward\nwith those who secured martyrdom for our support.\""}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_12.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_12.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"n1ZQ2bojvW"}
