(1) (Qur'an,\n102:1-2)\nThen he said:\nHow distant (from achievement) is their aim, how neglectful are these visitors and how\ndifficult is the affair. They have not taken lessons from things which are full of lessons, but\nthey took them from far off places. Do they boast on the dead bodies of their fore-fathers, or\ndo they regard the number of dead persons as a ground for feeling boastful of their number?\nThey want to revive the bodies that have become spiritless and the movements that have\nceased.\nThey are more entitled to be a source of lesson than a source of pride. They are more suitable\nfor being a source of humility than of honour.\nThey looked at them with weak-sighted eyes and descended into the hollow of ignorance. If\nthey had asked about them from the dilapidated houses and empty courtyards, they would\nhave said that they went into the earth in the state of misguidance and you too are heading\nignorantly towards them.\nYou trample their skulls, want to raise constructions on their corpses, you graze what they\nhave left and live in houses which they have vacated. The days (that lie) between them and\nyou are also bemoaning you and reciting elegies over you.\nThey are your fore-runners in reaching the goal and have arrived at the watering places before\nyou. They had positions of honour and plenty of pride. They were rulers and holders of\npositions. Now they have gone into the interstice where earth covers them from above and is\neating their flesh and drinking their blood. They lie in the hollows of their graves lifeless, no\nmore growing, and hidden, not to be found.\nThe approach of dangers does not frighten them, and the adversity of circumstances does not\ngrieve them. They do not mind earthquakes, nor do they pay heed to thunders. They are gone\nand not expected back. They are existent but unseen. They were united but are now dispersed.\nThey were friendly and are now separated.\nTheir accounts are unknown and their houses are silent, not because of length of time or\ndistance of place, but because they have been made to drink the cup (of death) which has\nchanged their speech into dumbness, their hearing into deafness and their movements into\nstillness.\nIt seems as though they are fallen in slumber. They are neighbours not feeling affection for\neach other, or friends who do not meet each other. The bonds of their knowing each other\nhave been worn out and the connections of their friendship have been cut asunder. Everyone\nof them is therefore alone although they are a group, and they are strangers, even though\nfriends. They are unaware of morning after a night and of evening after a day.\nThe night or the day when they departed has become ever existent for them. (2) They found\nthe dangers of their placed of stay more serious than they had apprehended, and they\nwitnessed that its signs were greater than they had guessed. The two objectives (namely\nparadise and hell) have been stretched for them upto a point beyond the reach of fear or hope.\nHad they been able to speak they would have become dumb to describe what they witnessed\nor saw.\nEven though their traces have been wiped out and their news has stopped (circulating), eyes\nare capable of drawing a lesson, as they looked at them, ears of intelligence heard them and\nthey spoke without uttering words. So, they said that handsome faces have been destroyed\nand delicate bodies have been smeared with earth. We have put on a worn-out shroud.\nThe narrowness of the grave has overwhelmed us and strangeness has spread among us. Our\nsilent abodes have been ruined. The beauty of our bodies has disappeared. Our known\nfeatures have become hateful. Our stay in the places of strangeness has become long. We do\nnot get relief from pain, nor widening from narrowness.\nNow. if you portray them in your mind, or if the curtains concealing them are removed from\nthem for you, in this state when their ears have lost their power and turned deaf, their eyes\nhave been filled with dust and sunk down, their tongues which were very active have been cut\ninto pieces, their hearts which were ever wakeful have become motionless in their chests, in\nevery limb of theirs a peculiar decay has occurred which has deformed it, and has paved the\nway for calamity towards it, all these lie powerless, with no hand to help them and no heart to\ngrieve over them, (then) you would certainly notice the grief of (their) hearts and the dirt of\n(their) eyes.\nEvery trouble of theirs is such that its position does not change and the distress does not clear\naway. How many a prestigious body and amazing beauty the earth has swallowed, although\nwhen in the world he enjoyed abundant pleasures and was nurtured in honour. He clung to\nenjoyments (even) in the hour of grief. If distress befell him he sought refuge in consolation\n(derived) through the pleasures of life and playing and games.\nHe was laughing at the world while the world was laughing at him because of his life full of\nforgetfulness. Then time trampled him like thorns, the days weakened his energy and death\nbegan to look at him from near. Then he was overtaken by a grief which he had never felt,\nand ailments appeared in place of the health he had previously possessed.\nHe then turned to that with which the physician had made him familiar, namely suppressing\nthe hot (diseases) with cold (medicines) and curing the cold with hot doses, but the cold\nthings did nothing save aggravate the hot ailments, while the hot ones did nothing except\nincreasing the coldness, nor did he acquire temperateness in his constitution but rather every\nailment of his increased till his physicians became helpless, his attendants grew loathsome\nand his own people felt disgusted from describing his disease, avoided answering those who\nenquired about him and quarrelled in front of him about the serious news which they were\nconcealing from him.\nThus, someone would say \"his condition is what it is\" and would console them with hopes of\nhis recovery, while another one would advocate patience on missing him, recalling to them\nthe calamities that had befallen the earlier generations. In this state when he was getting ready\nto depart from the world and leave his beloved ones, such a serious choking overtook him that\nhis senses became bewildered and the dampness of his tongue dried up.\nNow, there was many an important question whose reply he knew about he could not utter it,\nand many a voice that was painful for his heart that he heard but remained (unmoved) as\nthough he was deaf the voice of either and elder whom he used to respect or of a younger\nwhom he used to caress. The pangs of death are too hideous to be covered by description or to\nbe appreciated by the hearts of the people in this world.\n(1). The genesis of the descending of this verse is that the tribes of Banu `Abd Manaf and\nBanu Sahm began to boast against each other over the abundance of their wealth and the\nnumber of their tribesmen, and in order to prove they had a greater number each one began\nto include their dead as well, whereupon this verse was revealed to the effect that abundance\nof riches and majority in numbers has made you so forgetful that you count the dead also with\nthe living.\nThis verse is also taken to mean that abundance of riches and progeny has made you forgetful\ntill you reached the graves, but the utterance of Amir al-mu'minin supports the first meaning.\n(2). This means that for him he who dies in the day it is always day whereas for him who dies\nin the night the darkness of night never dispels, because they are at a place where there is no\nturning of the moon and the sun and no rotation of the nights and the days. The same\nmeaning has been expressed by a poet like this:\nThere is sure to be a day without a night,\nOr a night that would come without a day."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_221.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_221.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"CSCNxzeJPb"}
