I also stand witness that Muhammad is His slave. His Messenger and the Chief\nof His creatures. Whenever Allah divided the line of descent, He put him in the better one,\nand therefore, no evil-doer ever shared with him nor was any vicious person his partner.\nBeware! surely Allah, the Glorified, has provided for virtue those who are suited to it, for\ntruth pillars (that support it), and for obedience protection (against deviation). In every matter\nof obedience you will find Allah, the Glorified's succour that will speak through tongues and\naccord firmness to hearts. It has sufficiency for those who seek sufficiency, and a cure for\nthose who seek cure.\nThe characteristics of the virtuous whose guidance must be followed\nKnow that, certainly, those creatures of Allah who preserve His knowledge offer protection to\nthose things which He desires to be protected and make His springs flow (for the benefit of\nothers). They contact each other with friendliness and meet each other with affection. They\ndrink water from cups that quench the thirst and return from the watering places fully satiated.\nMisgiving does not affect them and backbiting does not gain ground with them.\nIn this way Allah has tied their nature with good manners. Because of this they love each\nother and meet each other. They have become superior, like seeds which are selected by\ntaking some and throwing away others. This selection has distinguished them and the process\nof choosing has purified them.\nTherefore, man should secure honour by adopting these qualities. He should fear the day of\nDoom before it arrives, and he should appreciate the shortness of his life and the shortness of\nhis sojourn in the place of stay which has only to last for his change over to the next place.\nHe should therefore do something for his change over and for the known stages of his\ndeparture. Blessed be he who possesses a virtuous heart, who obeys one who guides him,\ndesists from him who takes to ruin, catches the path of safety with the help of him who\nprovides him light (of guidance) and by obeying the leader who commands him, hastens\ntowards guidance before its doors are closed, gets open the door of repentance and removes\nthe (stain of) sins.\nHe has certainly been put on the right path and guided towards the straight road."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_215.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_215.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"ADrWoll8ez"}
