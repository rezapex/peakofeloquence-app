I spoke when others remained mum. I stroke with Divine light when others\nremained standing. I was the quietest of them in voice but the highest in going forward. I\ncleaved to its rein and applied myself solely to its pledge, like the mountain which neither\nsweeping wind could move nor storm could shake. No one could find fault with me nor could\nany speaker speak ill of me.\nThe low is in my view worthy of honour till I secure (his) right for him while the strong is in\nmy view weak till I take (other's) right from him. We are happy with the destiny ordained by\nAllah and have submitted to the command of Allah. Do you think I would speak lie about the\nProphet of Allah? By Allah, I am surely the first to testify him, so I will not be the first to\nfalsify him. I looked at my affairs and found that my obedience should have precedence over\nmy allegiance while my pledge with him is a burden on my neck."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_39.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_39.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"5Z7d6lZX0B"}
