I am tired of rebuking you. Do you accept this worldly life in place of the next\nlife? Or disgrace in place of dignity? When I invite you to fight your enemy your eyes revolve\nas though you are in the clutches of death, and in the senselessness of last moments. My\npleadings are not understood by you and you remain stunned. It is as though your hearts are\naffected with madness so that you do not understand. You have lost my confidence for good.\nNeither are you a support for me to lean upon, nor a means to honour and victory. Your\nexample is that of the camels whose protector has disappeared, so that if they are collected\nfrom one side they disperse away from the other side.\nBy Allah, how bad are you for igniting flames of war. You are intrigued against but do not\nintrigue (against the enemy). Your boundaries are decreasing but you do not get enraged over\nit. Those against you do not sleep but you are unmindful. By Allah, those who leave matters\none for the other are subdued. By Allah, I believed about you that if battle rages and death\nhovers around you, you will cut away from the son of Abi Talib like the severing of head\nfrom the trunk. (2)\nBy Allah, he who makes it possible for his adversary to so overpower him as to remove the\nflesh (from his bones), crush his bones and cut his skin into pieces, then it means that his\nhelplessness is great and his heart surrounded within the sides of his chest is weak. You may\nbecome like this if you wish. But for me, before I allow it I shall use my sharp edged swords\nof al-Mushrafiyyah which would cut as under the bones of the head and fly away arms and\nfeet. Thereafter, Allah will do whatever He wills.\nO' people, I have a right over you and you have a right over me. As for your right over me,\nthat is to counsel you, to pay you your dues fully, to teach you that you may not remain\nignorant and instruct you in behaviourism that you may act upon. As for my right over you, it\nis fulfilment of (the obligation of) allegiance, well-wishing in presence or in absence,\nresponse when I call you and obedience when I order you.\n(1). The word \"ash-Sham\" was a name used for a vast geographical area occupied by Muslim\ncountries in those days. This area included present-day Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. Its\ncapital was Damascus. Wherever the word Syria is mentioned (in this book) it should be\nunderstood in its larger meaning. (2). This sentence is employed for such severance after\nwhich there is no occasion or possibility of joining. The author of Durrah Najafiyyah has quoted\nseveral views in its explanation:\ni)\nIbn Durayd's view is that it means that. \"Just as when the head is severed its joining\nagain is impossible, in the same way you will not join me after once deserting me.\"\nii)\nal-Mufaddal says ar-ra's(head) was the name of a man, and a village of Syria, Bayt arra's\nis named after him. This man left his home and went away somewhere and never\nagain returned to his village after which the proverb sprang up \"you went as ar-ra's had\ngone.\"\niii)\nOne meaning of it is that \"Just as if the joints of the bones of the head are opened they\ncannot be restored, in the same way you will not join me after cutting from me.\niv)\nIt has also been said that this sentence is in the sense of separating completely. After\ncopying this meaning from the Sharh of ash-Shaykh Qutbu'd-Din ar-Rawandi, the\ncommentator Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written that this meaning is not correct because when\nthe word \"ar-ra's\" is used in the sense of whole it is not preceded by \"alif\" and \"lam\"\nv)\nIt is also taken to mean that \"You will so run away from me as one (fleeing for life) to\nsave his head.\" Besides this, one or two other meanings have also been stated but\nbeing remote they are disregarded.\nFirst of all it was used by the philosopher of Arabia Aktham ibn Sayfi while teaching unity and\nconcord to his children. He says:\nO' my children do not cut away (from each other) at the time of calamities like\nthe cutting of head, because after that you will never get together."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_36.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_36.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"trcx0Juz5W"}
