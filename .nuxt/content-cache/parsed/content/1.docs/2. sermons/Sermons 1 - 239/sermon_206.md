Can you tell me of anything\nwherein you have a right of which I have deprived you or a share which was due to you and\nwhich I have held away from you, or any Muslim who has laid any claim before me and I\nhave been unable to decide it or been ignorant of it, or committed a mistake about it?\nBy Allah, I had no liking for the caliphate nor any interest in government, but you yourselves\ninvited me to it and prepared me for it. When the caliphate came to me, I kept the Book of\nAllah in my view and all that Allah had put therein for us, and all that according to which He\nhas commanded us to take decisions; and I followed it, and also acted on whatever the\nProphet - may Allah bless him and his descendants - had laid down as his sunnah.\nIn this matter I did not need your advice or the advice of anyone else, nor has there been any\norder of which I was ignorant so that I ought to have consulted you or my Muslim brethren. If\nit were so I would not have turned away from you or from others.\nAs regards your reference to the question of equality (in distribution of shares from the\nMuslim common fund), this is a matter in which I have not taken a decision by my own\nopinion, nor have I done it by my caprice. But I found, and you too (must have) found, that\nwhatever the Prophet - may Allah bless him and his descendants - brought had been finalised.\nTherefore, I felt no need to turn towards you about a share which had been determined by\nAllah and in which His verdict has been passed.\nBy Allah, in this matter, therefore, you two or anyone else can have no favour from me. May\nAllah keep our hearts and your hearts in righteousness, and may He grant us and you\nendurance.\nThen Amir al-mu'minin added: May Allah have mercy on the person who, when he sees the\ntruth, supports it, when he sees the wrong, rejects it, and who helps the truth against him who\nis on the wrong."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_206.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_206.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"cuECIx7Cx1"}
