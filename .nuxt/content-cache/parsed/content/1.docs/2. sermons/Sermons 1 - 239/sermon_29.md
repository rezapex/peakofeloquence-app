It is the dress of piety and the protective armour of Allah and His trustworthy shield.\nWhoever abandons it Allah covers him with the dress of disgrace and the clothes of distress.\nHe is kicked with contempt and scorn, and his heart is veiled with screens (of neglect). Truth\nis taken away from him because of missing jihad. He has to suffer ignominy and justice is\ndenied to him.\nBeware! I called you (insistently) to fight these people night and day, secretly and openly and\nexhorted you to attack them before they attacked you, because by Allah, no people have been\nattacked in the hearts of their houses but they suffered disgrace; but you put it off to others\nand forsook it till destruction befell you and your cities were occupied.\nThe horsemen of Banu Ghamid(1) have reached al-Anbar and killed Hassan ibn Hassan al-\nBakri. They have removed your horsemen from the garrison.\nI have come to know that every one of them entered upon Muslim women and other women\nunder protection of Islam and took away their ornaments from legs, arms, necks and ears and\nno woman could resist it except by pronouncing the verse, \"We are for Allah and to Him we\nshall return.\" (Qur'an, 2 :156) Then they got back laden with wealth without any wound or\nloss of life.\nIf any Muslim dies of grief after all this he is not to be blamed but rather there is justification\nfor him before me.\nHow strange! How strange! By Allah my heart sinks to see the unity of these people on their\nwrong and your dispersion from your right. Woe and grief befall you. You have become the\ntarget at which arrows are shot. You are being killed and you do not kill. You are being\nattacked but you do not attack. Allah is being disobeyed and you remain agreeable to it. When\nI ask you to move against them in summer you say it is hot weather. Spare us till heat\nsubsides from us. When I order you to march in winter you say it is severely cold; give us\ntime till cold clears from us. These are just excuses for evading heat and cold because if you\nrun away from heat and cold, you would be, by Allah, running away (in a greater degree)\nfrom sword (war).\nO' you semblance of men, not men, your intelligence is that of children and your wit is that of\nthe occupants of the curtained canopies (women kept in seclusion from the outside world). I\nwish I had not seen you nor known you. By Allah, this acquaintance has brought about shame\nand resulted in repentance. May Allah fight you! You have filled my heart with pus and\nloaded my bosom with rage. You made me drink mouthful of grief one after the other.\nYou shattered my counsel by disobeying and leaving me so much so that Quraysh started\nsaying that the son of Abi Talib is brave but does not know (tactics of) war. Allah bless\nthem ! Is any one of them more fierce in war and more older in it than I am? I rose for it\nalthough yet within twenties, and here I am, have crossed over sixty, but one who is not\nobeyed can have no opinion.\n(1).

When the battlefield was clear the enemy ransacked al-Anbar with full freedom and left the city completely destroyed. When Amir al-mu'minin got the news of this attack he ascended the pulpit, and exhorted the people for crushing the enemy and called them to jihad, but from no quarter was there any voice or response. He alighted from the pulpit utterly disgusted and worried and in the same condition set off for the enemy on foot. When people observed this their sense of self respect and shame was also awakened and they too followed him. Amir al-mu'minin stopped at an-Nukhaylah.
