Surely fulfilment of pledge is the twin of truth. I do not know a better shield\n(against the assaults of sin) than it. One who realises the reality of return (to the next world)\nnever betrays. We are in a period when most of the people regard betrayal as wisdom.\nIn these days the ignorants call it excellence of cunning. What is the matter with them? Allah\nmay destroy them. One who has been through thick and thin of life finds the excuses to be\npreventing him from orders and prohibitions of Allah but he disregards them despite\ncapability (to succumb to them and follows the commands of Allah), while one who has no\nrestraints of religion seizes the opportunity (and accepts the excuses for not following the\ncommands of Allah)."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_43.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_43.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"G3c6ZQ4GYG"}
