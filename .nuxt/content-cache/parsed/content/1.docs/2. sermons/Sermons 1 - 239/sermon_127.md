By Allah, I won't do so as long as the world goes on, and as long as one star leads\nanother in the sky. Even if it were my property, I would have distributed it equally among\nthem, then why not when the property is that of Allah. Beware; certainly that giving of wealth\nwithout any right for it is wastefulness and lavishness.\nIt raises its doer in this world, but lowers him in the next world. It honours him before people,\nbut disgraces him with Allah. If a man gives his property to those who have no right for it or\ndo not deserve it, Allah deprives him of their gratefulness, and their love too would be for\nothers.\nThen if he falls on bad days and needs their help, they would prove the worst comrades and\nignoble friends."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_127.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_127.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"aLBuqHDnBb"}
