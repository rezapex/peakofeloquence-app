After the battle of Nahrawan, Amir al-mu'minin was delivering a sermon in the mosque of\nKufah about ill effects of \"Arbitration\" when a man stood up and said \"O' Amir al-mu'minin, first\nyou desisted us from this Arbitration but thereafter you allowed it.

You are a weaver and the son of a weaver brought up by unbelievers and a hypocrite. Curse of Allah and all the world be upon you. Commentators have written several reasons for Amir al-mu'minin calling Ash"}]},{"type":"text","value":"ath a weaver.\nFirst reason is, because he and his father like most of the people of his native place pursued\nthe industry of weaving cloth. So, in order to refer to the lowliness of his occupation he has\nbeen called 'weaver'. Yamanese had other occupations also but mostly this profession was\nfollowed among them. Describing their occupations Khalid ibn Safwan has mentioned this one\nfirst of all.\nWhat can I say about a people among whom there are only weavers, leather dyers, monkey\nkeepers and donkey riders. The hoopoe found them out, the mouse flooded them and a\nwoman ruled over them. (al-Bayan wa't-tabyin, vol. 1, p. 130)\nThe second reason is that \"hiyakah\" means walking by bending on either side, and since out of\npride and conceit this man used to walk shrugging his shoulders and making bends in his body,\nhe has been called \"hayik\".\nThe third reason is --- and it is more conspicuous and clear --- that he has been called a\nweaver to denote his foolishness and lowliness because every low person is proverbially known\nas a weaver. Their wisdom and sagacity can be well gauged by the fact that their follies had\nbecome proverbial, while nothing attains proverbial status without peculiar characteristics.\nNow, that Amir al-mu'minin has also confirmed it no further argument or reasoning is needed.\nThe fourth reason is that by this is meant the person who conspires against Allah and the Holy\nProphet and prepares webs of which is the peculiarity of hypocrites. Thus, in Wasa'il ash-\nShi"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"ah (vol. 12, p. 101) it is stated: It was mentioned before Imam Ja"}]},{"type":"text","value":"far as-Sadiq (p.b.u.h.) that the weaver is accursed when he\nexplained that the weaver implies the person who concocts against Allah and the Prophet.\nAfter the word weaver Amir al-mu'minin has used the word hypocrite, and there is no\nconjunction in between them in order to emphasise the nearness of meaning thereof. Then, on\nthe basis of this hypocrisy and concealment of truth he declared him deserving of the curse of\nAllah and all others, as Allah the Glorified says:\nVerily, those that conceal what we have sent of (Our) manifest evidences and guidance, after\nwhat we have (so) clearly shown for mankind in the Book (they are), those that Allah doth\ncurse them and (also) curse them all those who curse (such ones). (Qur'an, 2:159)\nAfter this Amir al-mu'minin says that \"You could not avoid the degradation of being prisoner\nwhen you were unbeliever, nor did these ignominies spare you after acceptance of Islam, and\nyou were taken prisoner.\" When an unbeliever the event of his being taken prisoner occurred\nin this way that when the tribe of Banu Murad killed his father Qays, he (al-Ash"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"ath) collected the warriors of Banu Kindah and divided them in three groups.

They accepted this term and asked him to write for them the names of those nine persons. He wrote down the nine names and made them over to them, but acting on his traditional wisdom forgot to write his own name in that list. After settling this he told his people that he has secured protection for them and the gate of the fort should be opened. When the gate was opened Ziyad forces pounced upon them.
