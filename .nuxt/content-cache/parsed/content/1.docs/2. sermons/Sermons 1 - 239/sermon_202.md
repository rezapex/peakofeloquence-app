Thus, Allah, the Glorified. has said:\nThen they hamstrung her, and turned (themselves) regretful. (Qur'an, 26:157).\nThen their land declined by sinking (into the earth) as the spike of a plough pierces\nunploughed weak land. O' people, he who treads the clear path (of guidance) reaches the\nspring of water, and whoever abandons it strays into waterless desert.\n(1). Thamud, in ancient Arabia, a tribe or group of tribes, seems to have been prominent from\nabout the 4th Century B.C. to the first half of the 7th Century A.D. Their place of stay and\nhomeland was at a place lying on the way between the Hijaz and Syria called the Valley of al-\nQura and bore this name because it consisted of several townships.\nAllah deputed for their guidance and directions the Prophet Salih who preached to them as\nAllah relates in his story:\nAnd unto (the people of) Thamud (We did send) their brother Salih, he said: \"O'\nmy people! worship ye Allah (alone). Ye have no god other than Him; indeed\ncame unto you a clear proof from your Lord; this is the She-camel of Allah\n(which) unto you is a sign, so leave it (free) to pasture in Allah's earth and touch\nher not with any harm, or ye shall be seized with a painful chastisement. And\nremember when He made you successors after the (people) `Ad and settled you\nin the earth, ye build mansions on its plain and hew the mountains into\ndwellings. So remember ye the bounties of Allah, and see ye not evil in the\nearth, making mischief.\" Said the chiefs of those who were puffed up with pride\namong his people to those who were reckoned weak, to those who believed\nfrom among them; \"Know ye that Salih is sent by his Lord?\" Said they: \"Verily, in\nwhat he hath been sent with, we are believers.\" Said those who were puffed up\nwith pride; \"Verily we, in that which ye believe are disbelievers.\" They\nhamstrung the She-camel and rebelled against the command of their Lord, and\nthey said: \"O' Salih! bring us what thou didst, threaten us with, if thou art of the\napostles.\n\" Then seized them (unawares) the earthquake, so became they in their\ndwellings, motionless (dead). Then he turned away from them and said: \"O' my\npeople! Indeed I did deliver unto you the message of my Lord, and did\nadmonish you, but ye love not the admonishers.\" (Qur'an, 7:73-79).\n(The people of) Thamud belied the warners, and said they: \"What! a single man,\nfrom among us! and we to follow him? Verily then we shall be astray and in\ndistress. It is that (the duty of) reminding hath been bestowed on him (alone),\nof all the (people) among us? Nay! he is a great liar, an insolent one!\" \"Soon\nthey shall know on the morrow, (as to) who is the liar, the insolent one! (O' Our\nApostle Salih!) verily We are going to send the She-camel as a trial for them; so\nwatch them and be patient.\nAnd (thou O' Salih!) make them aware (beforehand) that the water is (to be)\ndivided between them; and every drinking share shall be witnessed (on it).\" But\nthey called their companions, then he pursued (her) and hamstrung (her).\nHow (great) was My chastisement and My warning? Verily sent We upon them a\nsingle (violent) blast, and they were (all) like the dry stubble used by a fencer in\na fence. (Qur'an, 54:23-31)."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_202.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_202.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"1SM5Knp3r9"}
