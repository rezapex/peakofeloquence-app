Our cattle\nare thirsty and are bewildered in their enclosures. They are moaning like the moaning of\nmothers for their (dead) sons. They are tired of going to their meadows and longing for their\nwatering places. O' my Allah! have mercy on the groan of the groaning and yearn of the\nyearning. O' my Allah! have mercy on their bewilderment and their passages and their\ngroaning in their yards.\nO' my Allah ! we have come out to Thee when the years of drought have crowded over us like\n(a herd of) thin camels, and rain clouds have abandoned us. Thou art the hope for the afflicted\nand succour for the seeker. We call Thee when the people have lost hopes, cloud has been\ndenied and cattle have died, that do not seize us for our deeds and do not catch us for our sins,\nand spread Thy mercy over us through raining clouds, rain-fed blossoming, amazing\nvegetation, and heavy down-pours with which all that was dead regains life and all that was\nlost returns.\nO' my Allah! give rain from Thee which should be life giving, satisfying, thorough, widescattered,\npurified, blissful, plentiful and invigorating. Its vegetation should be exuberant, its\nbranches full of fruits and its leaves green. With it Thou reinvigorates the weak among Thy\ncreatures and bringeth back to life the dead among Thy cities.\nO' my Allah! give rain from Thee with which our high lands get covered with green herbage,\nstreams get flowing, our sides grow green, our fruits thrive, our cattle prosper, our far-flung\nareas get watered and our dry areas get its benefit, with Thy vast blessing and immeasurable\ngrant on Thy distressed universe and Thy untamed beasts.\nAnd pour upon us rain which is drenching, continuous and heavy; wherein one cycle of rain\nclashes with the other and one rain drop pushes another (into a continuous chain), its lightning\nshould not be deceptive, its cheek not rainless, its white clouds not scattered and rain not\nlight, so that the famine-stricken thrive with its abundant herbage and the drought stricken\ncome to life with its bliss. Certainly, Thou pourest down rain after the people lose hopes and\nspreadest Thy mercy, since Thou art the Guardian, the praiseworthy.\nAs-Sayyid ar-Radi says: The wonderful expressions of this sermon: Amir al-mu'minin's\nwords \"insahat jibaluna\" means the mountains cracked on account of drought. It is said\n\"insaha'ththawbu\" when it is torn. It is also said \"insaha'n-nabtu\" or \"saha\" or \"sawwaha\"\nwhen vegetation withers and dries up.\nHis words \"wa hamat dawabbuna\" means became thirsty, as \"huyam\" means thirst.\nHis words \"hadabiru's-sinin\". This is plural of \"hidbar\". It means the camel whom treading\nhas made thin. So Amir al-mu'minin likened with such a camel the year in which drought had\noccurred. The Arab poet Dhu ar-Rummah has said:\nThese thin camels remain in their places, facing hardships and move only when\nwe take them to some dry area.\nHis words \"wa la qaza`in rababuha\". Here \"al-qaza\" means small pieces of cloud scattered all\nround.\nHis words \"wa la shaffanin dhihabuha\". It stands for \"wa la dhata shaffanin dhihabuha\". \"ashshaffan\"\nmeans the cold wind and \"adh-dhihab\" means light rain. He omitted the world\n\"dhata\" from here because of the listener's knowledge of it."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_116.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_116.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"bmEnCmVLIA"}
