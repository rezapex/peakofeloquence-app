But this (death) is a matter\nthat cannot be reversed nor is it possible to repulse it.\nMay my father and my mother die for you; do remember us with Allah and take care of us."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_235.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_235.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"mDNOi6Dghj"}
