These semi-savage tribes lived by marauding, killing and devastating. They used to fight among themselves and attack neighbouring areas. Each tribe had a separate chief who was deemed responsible for their protection. Chingiz Khan (Temujin) who was one of the ruling chiefs of these tribes and was very brave and courageous had risen to organise all their divided tribes into one, and, despite their opposition he succeeded in overpowering them through his might and sagacity.

To know hidden things on a personal level is one thing, while to be gifted by Allah with\nknowledge of any matter and to convey it to others is different. The knowledge of the future\nwhich the prophets and vicegerents possess is gained by them through Allah's teaching and\ninforming. Allah alone has knowledge of events which are to happen in the future. Of course,\nHe passes this knowledge on to whoever He wills. Thus He says:\n(He alone is) the \"Knower of the unseen, neither doth He reveal His secrets unto\nany (one else) save unto that one of the Messengers whom He\nchooseth...\" (Qur'an, 72:26-27)\nIn this way Amir al-mu'minin also received knowledge of the future through the instructions of\nthe Prophet or inspiration from Allah, for which these words of Amir al-mu'minin stand\nevidence. Of course, sometimes it is not proper or expedient to disclose certain matters and\nthey are allowed to remain under a veil. Then no one can be acquainted with them as Allah\nsays:\nVerily, Allah is He with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour and He sendeth\ndown the rain, and knoweth He what is in the wombs; and knoweth not any soul\nwhat he shall earn the morrow, and knoweth not any soul in what lands he shall\ndie: Verily Allah is All-knowing, All- aware.
