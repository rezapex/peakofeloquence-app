He is a Being but not through phenomenon of coming into being.\nHe exists but not from non-existence. He is with everything but not in physical nearness.\nHe is different from everything but not in physical separation.\nHe acts but without connotation of movements and instruments. He sees even when there is\nnone to be looked at from among His creation. He is only One, such that there is none with\nwhom He may keep company or whom He may miss in his absence.\nThe Creation of the Universe\nHe initiated creation most initially and commenced it originally, without undergoing\nreflection, without making use of any experiment, without innovating any movement, and\nwithout experiencing any aspiration of mind. He allotted all things their times, put together\ntheir variations gave them their properties, and determined their features knowing them before\ncreating them, realising fully their limits and confines and appreciating their propensities and\nintricacies.\nWhen Almighty created the openings of atmosphere, expanse of firmament and strata of\nwinds, He flowed into it water whose waves were stormy and whose surges leapt one over the\nother.\nHe loaded it on dashing wind and breaking typhoons, ordered them to shed it back (as rain),\ngave the wind control over the vigour of the rain, and acquainted it with its limitations. The\nwind blew under it while water flowed furiously over it.\nThen Almighty created forth wind and made its movement sterile, perpetuated its position,\nintensified its motion and spread it far and wide. Then He ordered the wind to raise up deep\nwaters and to intensify the waves of the oceans. So the wind churned it like the churning of\ncurd and pushed it fiercely into the firmament throwing its front position on the rear and the\nstationary on the flowing till its level was raised and the surface was full of foam.\nThen Almighty raised the foam on to the open wind and vast firmament and made therefrom\nthe seven skies and made the lower one as a stationary surge and the upper one as protective\nceiling and a high edifice without any pole to support it or nail to hold it together. Then He\ndecorated them with stars and the light of meteors and hung in it the shining sun and effulgent\nmoon under the revolving sky, moving ceiling and rotating firmament.\nThe Creation of the Angels\nThen He created the openings between high skies and filled them with all classes of His\nangels. Some of them are in prostration and do not kneel up. Others in kneeling position and\ndo not stand up.\nSome of them are in array and do not leave their position. Others are extolling Allah and do\nnot get tired. The sleep of the eye or the slip of wit, or languor of the body or the effect of\nforgetfulness does not effect them.\nAmong them are those who work as trusted bearers of His message, those who serve as\nspeaking tongues for His prophets and those who carry to and fro His orders and injunctions.\nAmong them are the protectors of His creatures and guards of the doors of the gardens of\nParadise.\nAmong them are those also whose steps are fixed on earth but their necks are protruding into\nthe skies, their limbs are getting out on all sides, their shoulders are in accord with the\ncolumns of the Divine Throne, their eyes are downcast before it, they have spread down their\nwings under it and they have rendered between themselves and all else curtains of honour and\nscreens of power. They do not think of their Creator through image, do not impute to Him\nattributes of the created, do not confine Him within abodes and do not point at Him through\nillustrations.\nDescription of the Creation of Adam\nAllah collected from hard, soft, sweet and sour earth, clay which He dripped in water till it\ngot pure, and kneaded it with moisture till it became gluey. From it He carved an image with\ncurves, joints, limbs and segments. He solidified it till it dried up for a fixed time and a known\nduration.\nThen He blew into it out of His Spirit whereupon it took the pattern of a human being with\nmind that governs him, intelligence which he makes use of, limbs that serve him, organs that\nchange his position, sagacity that differentiates between truth and untruth, tastes and smells,\ncolours and species.\nHe is a mixture of clays of different colours, cohesive materials, divergent contradictories and\ndiffering properties like heat, cold, softness and hardness.\nThen Allah asked the angels to fulfil His promise with them and to accomplish the pledge of\nHis injunction to them by acknowledging Him through prostration to Him and submission to\nHis honoured position. So Allah said:\n\"Be prostrate towards Adam and they prostrated except Iblis (Satan).\" (Qur'an,\n2:34; 7:11; 17:61; 18:50; 20:116)\nSelf-importance withheld him and vice overcame him. So that he took pride in his own\ncreation with fire and treated contemptuously the creation of clay.\nSo Allah allowed him time in order to let him fully deserve His wrath, and to complete\n(man's) test and to fulfil the promise (He had made to Satan). Thus, He said:\n\"Verily you have been allowed time till the known Day.\" (Qur'an, 15:38; 38:81)\nThereafter, Allah inhabited Adam (p.b.u.h.) in a house where He made his life pleasant and\nhis stay safe, and He cautioned him of Iblis and his enmity. Then his enemy (Iblis) envied his\nabiding in Paradise and his contacts with the virtuous.\nSo he changed his conviction into wavering and determination into weakness. He thus\nconverted his happiness into fear and his prestige into shame. Then Allah offered to Adam (p.\nb.u.h.) the chance to repent, taught him words of His Mercy, promised him return to His\nParadise and sent him down to the place of trial and procreation of progeny.\nAllah chooses His Prophets\nFrom his (Adam's) progeny Allah chose prophets and took their pledge for his revelation and\nfor carrying His message as their trust. In course of time many people perverted Allah's trust\nwith them and ignored His position and took compeers along with Him. Satan turned them\naway from knowing Him and kept them aloof from His worship.\nThen Allah sent His Messengers and series of His prophets towards them to get them to fulfil\nthe pledges of His creation, to recall to them His bounties, to exhort them by preaching, to\nunveil before them the hidden virtues of wisdom and show them the signs of His\nOmnipotence namely the sky which is raised over them, the earth that is placed beneath them,\nmeans of living that sustain them, deaths that make them die, ailments that turn them old and\nincidents that successively betake them.\nAllah never allowed His creation to remain without a Prophet deputised by Him, or a book\nsent down from Him or a binding argument or a standing plea.\nThese Messengers were such that they did not feel little because of smallness of their number\nor of largeness of the number of their falsifiers. Among them was either a predecessor who\nwould name the one to follow or the follower who had been introduced by the predecessor.\nThe Prophethood of Muhammmad\nIn this way ages passed by and times rolled on, fathers passed away while sons took their\nplaces till Allah deputised Muhammmad (peace be upon him and his progeny) as His Prophet,\nin fulfilment of His promise and in completion of His Prophethood.\nHis pledge had been taken from the Prophets, his traits of character were well reputed and his\nbirth was honourable. The people of the earth at this time were divided in different parties,\ntheir aims were separate and ways were diverse.\nThey either likened Allah with His creation or twisted His Names or turned to else than Him.\nThrough Muhammmad (p.b.u.h.a.h.p.) Allah guided them out of wrong and with his efforts\ntook them out of ignorance.\nThen Allah chose for Muhammmad, peace be upon him and on his progeny, to meet Him,\nselected him for His own nearness, regarded him too dignified to remain in this world and\ndecided to remove him from this place of trial.\nSo He drew him towards Himself with honour. Allah may shower His blessing on him, and\nhis progeny.\nThe Holy Qur'an and Sunnah\nBut the Prophet left among you the same which other Prophets left among their peoples,\nbecause Prophets do not leave them untended (in dark) without a clear path and a standing\nensign, namely the Book of your Creator clarifying its permission and prohibitions, its\nobligations and discretion, its repealing injunctions and the repealed ones, its permissible\nmatters and compulsory ones, its particulars and the general ones, its lessons and illustrations,\nits long and the short ones, its clear and obscure ones, detailing its abbreviations and\nclarifying its obscurities.\nIn it there are some verses whose knowledge (1) is obligatory and others whose ignorance by\nthe people is permissible.\nIt also contains what appears to be obligatory according to the Book (2) but its repeal is\nsignified by the Prophet's action (sunnah) or that which appears compulsory according to the\nProphet's action but the Book allows not following it.\nOr there are those which are obligatory in a given time but not so after that time. Its\nprohibitions also differ. Some are major regarding which there exists the threat of fire (Hell),\nand others are minor for which there are prospects of forgiveness.\nThere are also those of which a small portion is also acceptable (to Allah) but they are capable\nof being expanded.\nIn this very sermon he spoke about Hajj\nAllah has made obligatory upon you the pilgrimage (hajj) to His sacred House which is the\nturning point for the people who go to it as beasts or pigeons go towards spring water. Allah\nthe glorified made it a sign of their supplication before His Greatness and their\nacknowledgement of His Dignity.\nHe selected from among His creation those who on listening to His call responded to it and\ntestified His word. They stood in the position of His Prophets and resembled His angels who\nsurround the Divine Throne securing all the benefits of performing His worship and hastening\ntowards His promised forgiveness.\nAllah the glorified made it (His sacred House) an emblem for Islam and an object of respect\nfor those who turn to it. He made obligatory its pilgrimage and laid down its claim for which\nHe held you responsible to discharge it.\nThus, Allah the glorified said:\n\". . . And (purely) for Allah, is incumbent upon mankind, the pilgrimage to the\nHouse, for those who can afford to journey thither. And whoever denieth then\nverily, Allah is Selfsufficiently independent of the worlds\" (Qur'an, 3:96).\n(1). \"The foremost in religion (din) is His knowledge.\" The literal meaning of din is obedience,\nand its popular sense is code, whether literal sense is taken or the popular one, in either case,\nif the mind is devoid of any conception of Divinity, there would be no question of obedience,\nnor of following any code; because when there is no aim there is no point in advancing\ntowards it; where there is no object in view there is no sense in making efforts to achieve it.\nNevertheless, when the nature and guiding faculty of man bring him in contact with a superior\nAuthority and his taste for obedience and impulse of submission subjugates him before a Deity,\nhe finds himself bound by certain limitations as against abject freedom of activity.\nThese very limitations are din (Religion) whose point of commencement is knowledge of Allah\nand acknowledgement of His Being.\nAfter pointing out the essentials of Divine knowledge Amir al-mu'minin has described its\nimportant constituents and conditions. He has held those stages of such knowledge which\npeople generally regard as the point of highest approach to be insufficient.\nHe says that its first stage is that with the natural sense of search for the unknown and the\nguidance of conscience or on hearing from the followers of religions an image of the Unseen\nBeing known as Allah is formed in the mind.\nThis image in fact is the forerunner of the obligation to thinking and reflection and to seeking\nHis knowledge.\nBut those who love idleness, or are under pressure of environment, do not undertake this\nsearch despite creation of such image and the image fails to get testified. In this case they\nremain deprived of Divine knowledge, and since their inaccess to the stage of testifying after\nthe formation of image is by volition they deserve to be questioned about it.\nBut one who is moved by the power of this image goes further and considers thinking and\nreflection necessary.\nIn this way one reaches the next stage in the attainment of Divine knowledge, namely to\nsearch for the Creator through diversification of creation and species of creatures, because\nevery picture is a solid and inflexible guide to the existence of its painter and every effect to\nthe action of its cause.\nWhen he casts his glance around himself he does not find a single thing which might have\ncome into existence without the act of a maker so much so that he does not find the sign of a\nfootstep without a walker nor a construction without a builder.\nHow can he comprehend that this blue sky with the sun and the moon in its expanse and the\nearth with the exuberance of its grass and flowers could have come into existence without the\naction of a Creator.\nTherefore, after observing all that exists in the world and the regulated system of the entire\ncreation no one can help concluding that there is a Creator for this world of diversities because\nexistence cannot come out of non-existence, nor can existence sprout forth from nothingness.\nThe Holy Qur'an has pointed to this reasoning thus:\n\". . . What! about Allah is there any doubt, the Originator of the heavens and the\nearth ?. . .\" (14:10).\nBut this stage would also be insufficient if this testimony in favour of Allah is tarnished by belief\nin the divinity of some other deity.\nThe third stage is that His existence should be acknowledged along with belief in Unity and\nOneness. Without this the testimony to Allah's existence cannot be complete because if more\ngods are believed in He would not be One whereas it is necessary that He should be One.\nThe reason is that in case of more than one god the question would arise whether one of them\ncreated all this creation or all of them together.\nIf one of them created it there should be some differential to distinguish him otherwise he\nwould be accorded preferential position without reason, which is unacceptable to the mind. If\nall have created it collectively then the position has only two forms; either he cannot perform\nhis functions without the assistance of others or he is above the need for their assistance.\nThe first case means his incapability and being in need of others while the other case means\nthat they are several regular performers of a single act and the fallacy of both has already\nbeen shown.\nIf we assume that all the gods performed the act of creation by dividing among themselves\nthen, in this case all the creation will, not bear the same relationship towards the creator since\neach creature will bear relationship only to its own creator whereas every creature should have\none and the same relationship to all creators.\nThis is because all the creation should have one and the same relationship to all the creators\nas all the created in their capacity to accept effect and all the creators in their capacity to\nproduce effect should be similar.\nIn short there is no way but to acknowledge Him as One because in believing in numerous\ncreators there remains no possibility of the existence of any other thing, and destruction\nproves implicit for the earth, the sky and everything in creation.\nAllah the glorified has expressed this argument in the following words:\n\"Had there been in (the heavens and the earth "},{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"other"}]},{"type":"text","value":" ) gods except Allah, they\nboth had been in disorder. . .\" (Qur'an, 21:22).\nThe fourth stage is that Allah should be regarded free of all defects and deficiencies, and\ndevoid of body, form, illustration, similarity, position of place or time, motion, stillness,\nincapability and ignorance because there can be no deficiency or defect in the perfect Being\nnor can anyone be deemed like Him because all these attributes bring down a being from the\nhigh position of the Creator to the low position of the created.\nThat is why along with Unity, Allah has held purity from deficiency of equal importance.\n\"Say: 'He (Allah) is One (alone).\nAllah, the needless.\nHe begetteth not, nor is He begotten.\nAnd there is none like unto Him\" (Qur'an, 112:1-4).\n\"Vision perceiveth Him not, and He perceiveth (all) vision; He is the Subtle, the\nAll-aware\" (Qur'an, 6:104).\n\"So coin ye not any similitudes to Allah; verily Allah knoweth (every thing) and\nye know not.\" (Qur'an, 16:74).\n\". . .Nothing whatsoever (is there) like the like of Him; and He (alone) is the Allhearing\nand the All-seeing.\" (Qur'an, 42:11)\nThe fifth stage of completing His Knowledge is that attributes should not be put in Him from\noutside lest there be duality in His Oneness, and deviating from its proper connotation Unity\nmay fall in the labyrinth of one in three and three in one, because His Being is not a\ncombination of essence and form so that attribute may cling to Him like smell in the flowers or\nbrightness in the stars.\nRather, He is the fountain head of all attributes and needs no medium for manifestation of His\nperfect Attributes.\nIf He is named Omniscient it is because the signs of his knowledge are manifest. If He is called\nOmnipotent it is because every particle points to His Omnipotence and Activity, and if to Him is\nattributed the power to listen or to see it is because the cohesion of the entire creation and its\nadministration cannot be done without hearing or seeing but the existence of these attributes\nin Him cannot be held to be in the same way as in the creation namely that He should be\ncapable to know only after He acquires knowledge or He should be powerful and strong only\nafter energy runs into His limbs because taking attributes as separate from His Being would\nconnote duality and where there is duality unity disappears.\nThat is how Amir al-mu'minin has rejected the idea of attributes being addition to His Being,\npresented Unity in its true significance, and did not allow Unity to be tainted with stains of\nmultiplicity.\nThis does not mean that adjectives cannot at all be attributed to Him, as this would be giving\nsupport to those who are groping in the dark abyss of negativism, although every nook and\ncomer in the entire existence is brimming with His attributes and every particle of creation\nstands witness that He has knowledge, He is powerful, He hears, He sees.\nHe nurtures under His care and allows growth under His mercy.\nThe intention is that for Him nothing can be suggested to serve as an adjunct to Him, because\nHis self includes attributes and His attributes connote His Self.\nLet us learn this very theme in the words of al-Imam Abu "},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Abdillah Ja"}]},{"type":"text","value":"far ibn Muhammmad as-\nSadiq (p.b.u.h.) comparing it with the belief in Unity adopted by other religions and then\nappreciate who is the exponent of the true concept of Unity.\nThe Imam says:\n\"Our Allah the Glorified, the Magnificent has ever had knowledge as His Self\neven though there was nothing to know, sight as His Self even though there was\nnothing to know, sight as His Self even though there was nothing to behold,\nhearing as His Self even though there was nothing to hear, and Potence as His\nSelf even though there was nothing to be under His Potence.\nWhen He created the things and the object of knowledge came into existence\nHis knowledge became related to the known, hearing related to the heard, sight\nrelated to the seen, and potence related to its object.\" (at-Tawhid by ash-\nShaykh as-Saduq, p.139)\nThis is the belief over which the Imams of the Prophet's family are unanimous, but the majority\ngroup has adopted a different course by creating the idea of differentiation between His Self\nand Attributes.\nash-Shahristani says on page 42 of his book Kitab al-milal wa'n-nihal:\nAccording to Abu'l-Hasan al-Ash`ari, Allah knows through (the attribute of)\nknowledge, is Powerful through activity, speaks through speech, hears through\nhearing and sees through sight.\nIf we regard attributes distinct from Self in this manner there would be two alternatives; either\nthe attributes must have existed in Him from ever or they must have occurred later.\nIn the first case we have to recognise as many eternal objects as the attributes which all will\nshare with Him in being eternal, but \"Allah is above what the people deem Him to have\nequals.\" In the second case in addition to subjecting Him to the alternations it would also mean\nthat before the acquiring of the attributes He was neither scient, nor powerful, nor hearer nor\nbeholder and this runs counter to the basic tenet of Islam.\n\". . . Allah hath decreed trade lawful and hath forbidden interest. . .\" (Qur'an,\n2:275)\n\"And when you have finished the prayer remember Allah standing, and sitting,\nand reacting, and when ye are secure (from danger) establish\nprayer . . .\" (Qur'an, 4:103)\n\"O' ye men! eat of what is in the earth lawful and good and follow not the footsteps\nof Satan; for verily he is an open enemy unto you.\" (Qur'an, 2:168)\n\"(And) say thou: 'I am only a man like you, it is revealed unto me that your god\nis but one God, therefore whosoever desireth to meet his Lord, let him do good\ndeeds, and associate not any one in the worship of his Lord'.\" (Qur'an, 18:110)\n\"What! enjoin ye upon the people righteousness and ye forget your own selves?\nYet ye read the scripture? What: do ye not understand?\" (Qur'an, 2:44).\n(2). About the Qur'an, Amir al-mu'minin says that it contains description of the permitted and\nthe forbidden acts such as \"Allah has allowed sale and purchase but prohibited usury.\"\nIt clarifies obligatory and optional acts such as \"when you have finished the prayer (of fear)\nremember Allah rising, sitting or lying and when you feel safe (from the enemy) then say the\nprayers (as usual).\"\nHere prayer is obligatory while other forms of remembering (Allah) are optional.\nIt has repealing and repealed verses such as about the period of seclusion after husband's\ndeath \"four months and ten days\" or the repealed one such as \"till one year without going out\"\nwhich shows that this period of seclusion should be one year. In particular places it permits the\nforbidden such as \"whoever is compelled without being wilfully wrongful or transgressor,\ncommits no sins.\"\nIt has positive injunctions such as \"One should not add anyone with Allah in worship.\n\" It has particular and general injunctions. Particular is the one where the word shows\ngenerality but the sense is limited such as \"I have made you superior over worlds, O' Bani\nIsra'il.\"\nHere the sense of \"Worlds,\" is confined to that particular time, although the word is general in\nits literal meaning.\nThe general injunctions is one which is extensive in meaning such as \"Allah has knowledge of\neverything.\" It has lessons and illustrations lessons such as \"Allah caught him in the\npunishment of this world and the next and there is lesson in it.\"\n\"So seized him Allah, with the chastisement in the hereafter, and the life before\n(it).\" (Qur'an, 79:25)\n\"Verily in this there is a lesson unto him who feareth (Allah).\" (Qur'an, 79:26)\n\"A kind word and pardon is better than charity that is followed by injury, and\nverily Allah is Self-sufficient, the Most forbearing.\" (Qur'an, 2:263)\n\"And remember when We made a covenant with you and raised the 'tur' (the\nMountain) above you (saying), 'Hold ye fast that which We have bestowed upon\nyou with the strength (of determination) and remember that which is therein so\nthat you may guard (yourself) against evil'.\" (Qur'an, 2:63)\n\"So we made it a lesson for (those of) their own times and for those (of their\nposterity) who came after them and an exhortation unto those who guard\n(themselves) against evil.\" (Qur'an, 2:66)\n\"He it is Who fashioneth you in the wombs (of your mothers) as He liketh; There\nis no god but He, the All-mighty, the All-wise.\" (Qur'an, 3:5)\n\"Obedience and a fair word; but when the affair is determined then if they be\ntrue to Allah, it would certainly be better for them.\" (Qur'an, 47:21)\n\"O' those who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will;\nand do not straiten them in order that ye may take a part of what ye have given,\nunless they are guilty of manifest lewdness; but deal kindly with them, and if ye\nhate them, it may be that ye hate a thing while Allah hath placed in it abundant\ngood.\" (Qur'an, 4:19)\n\"Say thou (unto the people of the Book), 'Dispute ye with us about Allah;\nwhereas He is our Lord and your Lord, and for us are our deeds and for you are\nyour deeds; to Him (alone) we are (exclusively) loyal?\" (Qur'an, 2:139)\n\"There is a lesson in it for him who fears Allah,\" and illustration as \"The example of those who\nspend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a grain which grows seven ears each one of which\nbears hundred grains.\" It has unspecific and specific verses. Unspecific is one which has no\nlimitation on specification such as \"Recall when Moses told his people 'Allah commands you to\nsacrifice a cow.'\"\nSpecific is one where denotation is limited such as Allah says that \"the cow should be such that\nit has neither been used for ploughing nor for irrigation fields.\" There is clear and obscure in it.\nClear is that which has no intricacy such as \"Verily Allah has sway over everything,\" while\nobscure is that whose meaning has complication such as \"the Merciful (Allah) occupies the\nthrone,\" whose apparent meaning gives the impression as if Allah is bodily sitting on the\nThrone although the intention is to press His authority and control. In it there are brief\ninjunctions such as \"establish prayer\" and those of deep meanings such as the verses about\nwhich says:\n\"That the sense is not known except to Allah and those immersed in knowledge.\" Then Amir almu'minin\ndilates upon this theme in a different style, he says that there are some things in it\nwhich are necessary to know, such as \"So know that there is no god but Allah\" and there are\nothers which are not necessary to know such as \"alif lam mim\" etc. It has also injunctions\nwhich have been repealed by the Prophet's action such as \"As for your women who commit\nadultery get four male witnesses and if four witnesses do appear shut such women in the\nhouse till death ends their life.\n\" This punishment was current in early Islam but was later replaced by stoning in the case of\nmarried women. In it there are some injunctions which repealed the Prophet's action such as\n\"Turn your face towards Masjid al-haram\" by which the injunction for facing Bayt al-maqdis\nwas repealed.\nIt also contains injunctions which are obligatory only at a particular time after which their\nobligation ends, such as \"when the call for prayer is made on Friday then hasten towards\nremembrance of Allah.\" It has also indicated grades of prohibitions as the division of sins into\nlight and serious ones - light such as \"Tell the believers to lower their eyes\" and serious ones\nsuch as \"whoever kills a Believer wilfully his award is to remain in Hell for ever.\" It also\ncontains injunctions where a little performance is enough but there is scope for further\nperformance such as \"Read the Qur'an as much as you easily can.\"\n\"Verily your Lord, certainly is He the All-mighty, the All-merciful.\" (Qur'an, 26:9)\n\"Say thou (O' Our Prophet Muhammmad) unto the believer men that they cast\ndown their gaze and guard their private parts; that is purer for them; verily Allah\nis All-aware of what (all) ye do.\" (Qur'an, 24:30)\n\"Not equal are those of the believers who sit (holding back) other than those\nhurt, and those who strive in the way of Allah with their wealth and their selves\n(lives).
