Who is\napparent to their hearts because of clear proof; Who created without meditating, since\nmeditating does not befit except one who has thinking organs while He has no thinking organ\nin Himself.\nHis knowledge has split forth the inside of unknown secrets and covered the bottom of deep\nbeliefs.\nA part of the same sermon about the Holy Prophet\nAllah chose him from the lineal tree of prophets, from the flame of light, from the forehead of\ngreatness, from the best part of the valley of al-Bat'ha', from the lamps for darkness, and from\nthe sources of wisdom.\nA part of the same sermon\nThe Prophet was like a roaming physician who has set ready his ointments and heated his\ninstruments.\nHe uses them wherever the need arises for curing blind hearts, deaf ears, and dumb tongues.\nHe followed with his medicines the spots of negligence and places of perplexity.\nBlaming Muslims\nThey (people) did not take light from the lights of his wisdom nor did they produce flame\nfrom the flint of sparkling knowledge . So in this matter they are like grazing cattle and hard\nstones. Nevertheless, hidden things have appeared for those who perceive, the face of right\nhas become clear for the wanderer, the approaching moment has raised the veil from its face\nand signs have appeared for those who search for them.\nWhat is the matter with me! I see you just bodies without spirits and spirits without bodies,\ndevotees without good, traders without profits, wakeful but sleeping, present but unseen,\nseeing but blind, hearing but deaf and speaking but dumb.\nI notice that misguidance has stood on its centre and spread (all round) through its off-shoots.\nIt weighs you with its weights and confuses you with its measures. Its leader is an out-cast\nfrom the community. He persists on misguidance.\nSo on that day none from among you would remain except as the sediment in a cooking pot or\nthe dust left after dusting a bundle. It would scrape you as leather is scraped, and trample you\nas harvest is trampled, and pick out the believer as a bird picks out a big grain from the thin\ngrain.\nWhere are these ways taking you, gloom misleading you, and falsehoods deceiving you?\nWhence are you brought and where are you driven? For every period there is a written\ndocument and everyone who is absent has to return. So listen to your godly leader and keep\nyour hearts present.\nIf he speaks to you be wakeful. The forerunner must speak truth to his people, should keep his\nwits together and maintain presence of mind. He has clarified to you the matter as the stitchhole\nis cleared, and scraped it as the gum is scraped (from the twigs).\nNevertheless, now the wrong has set itself on its places and ignorance has ridden on its riding\nbeasts. Unruliness has increased while the call for virtue is suppressed. Time has pounced\nupon like a devouring carnivore, and wrong is shouting like a camel after remaining silent.\nPeople have become brothers over ill-doings. have forsaken religion, are united in speaking\nlie but bear mutual hatred in the matter of truth.\nWhen such is the case, the son would be a source of anger (instead of coolness of the eye to\nparents) and rain the cause of heat, the wicked would abound and the virtuous would\ndiminish. The people of this time would be wolves, its rulers beasts, the middle class men\ngluttons and the poor (almost) dead.\nTruth would go down, falsehood would overflow, affection would be claimed with tongues\nbut people would be quarrelsome at heart. Adultery would be the key to lineage while chastity\nwould be rare and Islam would be worn overturned like the skin."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_109.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_109.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"4pdBvMn1sx"}
