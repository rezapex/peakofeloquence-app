We do not make use of\nwhat we know and do not discover what we do not know. We do not fear calamity till it\nbefalls.\nPeople are of four categories. Among them is one who is prevented from mischief only by his\nlow position, lack of means and paucity of wealth.\nThen there is he who has drawn his sword, openly commits mischief, has collected his\nhorsemen and foot-men and has devoted himself to securing wealth, leading troops, rising on\nthe pulpit and has allowed his faith to perish. How bad is the transaction that you allow\n(enjoyment of) this world to be a price for yourself as an alternative for what there is with\nAllah for you.\nAnd among them is he who seeks (benefits of) this world through actions meant for the next\nworld, but does not seek (good of) the next world through actions of this world. He keeps his\nbody calm (in dignity), raises small steps, holds up his clothes, embellishes his body for\nappearance of trust-worthiness and uses the position of Allah's connivance as a means of\ncommitting sins.\nThen there is one whose weakness and lack of means have held him back from conquest of\nlands. This keeps down his position and he has named it contentment and he clothes himself\nwith the robe of renunciation although he has never had any connection with these qualities.\nThen there remain a few people in whose case the remembrance of their return (to Allah on\nDoomsday) keeps their eyes bent, and the fear of resurrection moves their tears. Some of\nthem are scared away (from the world) and dispersed; some are frightened and subdued; some\nare quiet as if muzzled; some are praying sincerely, some are grief-stricken and pain-ridden\nwhom fear has confined to namelessness and disgrace has shrouded them, so they are in (the\nsea of) bitter water, their mouths are closed and their hearts are bruised. They preached till\nthey were tired, they were oppressed till they were disgraced and they were killed till they\nremained few in number.\nThe world in your eyes should be smaller than the bark of acacia and the clippings of wool.\nSeek instruction from those who preceded you before those who follow you take instruction\nfrom you, and keep aloof from it realising its evil because it cuts off even from those who\nwere more attached to it than you.\nas-Sayyid ar-Radi says: Some ignorant persons attributed this sermon to Mu"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"awiyah but it is the speech of Amir al-mu'minin.
