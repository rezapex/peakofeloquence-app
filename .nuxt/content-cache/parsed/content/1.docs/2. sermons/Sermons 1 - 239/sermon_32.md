When after crossing the border of Hijaz, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr reached the place Aylah on the coast of the Red Sea people caught sight of a camel rider who was making his camel run so fast as though the enemy was chasing him.

Kinanah ibn Bishr at-Tujibi said, \"See his water-skin.\" People said, \"Leave him, how can\nthere be a letter in water! Kinanah said, \"You do not know what cunning these people play. \"\nConsequently, the water-skin was opened and seen. There was a lead pipe in it wherein was a\nletter.

He replied that it was that of the Government.\nThey enquired who had sent it.\nHe said he had no knowledge of it. People then said, \"Good Heavens. Everything is yours but\nyou do not know who had sent it.\nIf you are so helpless, you leave this Caliphate and get off from it so that such a man comes\nwho can administer the affairs of the Muslims.\" He replied, \"It is not possible that I should put\noff the dress of Caliphate which Allah has put on me. Of course, I would offer repentance.\" The\npeople said, \"Why should you speak of repentance which has already been flouted on the day\nwhen Marwan was representing you on your door, and whatever was wanting has been made\nup by this letter.
