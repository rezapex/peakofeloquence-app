He had to fight those\nwho disobeyed him in company with those who followed him, leading them towards their\nsalvation and hastening with them lest death overtook them.\nWhen any weary person sighed or a distressed one stopped he stood at him till he got him his\naim, except the worst in whom there was not virtue at all. Eventually he showed them their\ngoal and carried them to their places (of deliverance).\nConsequently, their affairs moved on and their hand-mill began to rotate (i.e. position gained\nstrength), their spears got straightened.\nBy Allah, I was among their rear-guard till they turned back on their sides and were flocked\nin their rope. I never showed weakness or lack of courage, nor did I betray or become languid.\nBy Allah, I shall split the wrong till I extract right from its flanks.\nas-Sayyid ar-Radi says: I have quoted a selected part of this sermon before, but since I have\nfound in the narration that this part differs from the previous one, more or less, I deemed it\nnecessary to quote it again here."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_105.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_105.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"7Qai7ohw55"}
