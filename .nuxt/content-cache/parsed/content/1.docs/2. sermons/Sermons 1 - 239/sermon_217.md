A right is very vast in description but\nvery narrow in equitability of action. It does not accrue to any person unless it accrues against\nhim also, and right does not accrue against a person unless it also accrues in his favour.\nIf there is any right which is only in favour of a person with no (corresponding) right accruing\nagainst him it is solely for Allah, the Glorified, and not for His creatures by virtue of His\nmight over His creatures and by virtue of the justice permeating all His decrees.\nOf course, He the Glorified, has created His right over creatures that they should worship\nHim, and has laid upon Himself (the obligation of) their reward equal to several times the\nrecompense as a mark of His bounty and the generosity that He is capable of.\nThen, from His rights, He, the Glorified, created certain rights for certain people against\nothers. He made them so as to equate with one another. Some of these rights produce other\nrights. Some rights are such that they do not accrue except with others. The greatest of these\nrights that Allah, the Glorified, has made obligatory is the right of the ruler over the ruled and\nthe right of the ruled over the ruler.\nThis is an obligation which Allah, the Glorified, has placed on each other. He has made it the\nbasis of their (mutual) affection, and an honour for their religion. Consequently, the ruled\ncannot prosper unless the rulers are sound, while the rulers cannot be sound unless the ruled\nare steadfast.\nIf the ruled fulfil the rights of the ruler and the ruler fulfils their rights, then right attains the\nposition of honour among them, the ways of religion become established, signs of justice\nbecome fixed and the sunnah gains currency.\nIn this way time will improve, the continuance of government will be expected, and the aims\nof the enemies will be frustrated. But if the ruled gain sway over the ruler, or the ruler\noppresses the ruled, then difference crops up in every word, signs of oppression appear,\nmischief enters religion and the ways of the sunnah are forsaken.\nThen desires are acted upon, the commands (of religion) are discarded, diseases of the spirit\nbecome numerous and there is no hesitation in disregarding even great rights, nor in\ncommitting big wrongs. In such circumstances, the virtuous are humiliated while the vicious\nare honoured, and there are serious chastisements from Allah, the Glorified, onto the people.\nYou should therefore counsel each other (for the fulfilment of your obligations) and cooperate\nwith each other. However extremely eager a person may be to secure the pleasure of\nAllah, and however fully he strives for it, he cannot discharge (his obligation for) obedience\nto Allah, the Glorified, as is really due to Him, and it is an obligatory right of Allah over the\npeople that they should advise each other to the best of their ability and co-operate with each\nother for the establishment of truth among them.\nNo person, however great his position in the matter of truth, and however advanced his\ndistinction in religion may be, is above co-operation in connection with the obligations placed\non him by Allah. Again, no man, however small he may be regarded by others, and however\nhumble he may appear before eyes, is too low to co-operate or to be afforded co-operation in\nthis matter.\nOne of Amir al-mu'minin's companions replied to him by a long speech wherein he praised\nhim much and mentioned his own listening to him and obeying him, whereupon Amir almu'minin\nsaid:\nIf a man in his mind regards Allah's glory as being high and believes in his heart that Allah's\nposition is sublime, then it is his right that on account of the greatness of these things he\nshould regard all other things small. Among such persons he on whom Allah's bounty is great\nand Allah's favours are kind has a greater obligation, because Allah's bounty over any person\ndoes not increase without an increase in Allah's right over him.\nIn the view of virtuous people, the worst position of rulers is that it may be thought about\nthem that they love glory, and their affairs may be taken to be based on pride. I would really\nhate that it may occur to your mind that I love high praises or to hear eulogies. By the grace of\nAllah I am not like this. Even If I had loved to be mentioned like this, I would have given it\nup in submissiveness before Allah, the Glorified, rather than accept greatness and sublimity to\nwhich He is more entitled.\nGenerally, people feel pleased at praise after good performances; but do not mention for me\nhandsome praise for the obligations I have discharged towards Allah and towards you,\nbecause of (my) fear about those obligations which I have not discharged and for issuing\ninjunctions which could not be avoided, and do not address me in the manner despots are\naddressed.\nDo not evade me as the people of passion are (to be) evaded, do not meet me with flattery and\ndo not think that I shall take it ill if a true thing is said to me, because the person who feels\ndisgusted when truth is said to him or a just matter is placed before him would find it more\ndifficult to act upon them.\nTherefore, do not abstain from saying a truth or pointing out a matter of justice because I do\nnot regard myself above erring (1). I do not escape erring in my actions but that Allah helps\nme (in avoiding errors) in matters in which He is more powerful than I.\nCertainly, I and you are slaves owned by Allah, other than Whom there is no Lord except\nHim. He owns our selves which we do not own. He took us from where we were towards\nwhat means prosperity to us. He altered our straying into guidance and gave us intelligence\nafter blindness.\n(1). That the innocence of angels is different from the innocence of manneeds no detailed\ndiscussion. The innocence of angels means that they do not possess the impulse to sin, but the\ninnocence of man means that, although he has human frailties and passions, yet he possesses\na peculiar power to resist them and he is not over-powered by them so as to commit sins.\nThis very ability is called innocence and it prevents the rising up of personal passions and\nimpulses. Amir al-mu'minin's saying that \"I do not regard myself above erring\" refers to those\nhuman dictates and passions, and his saying that \"Allah helps me in avoiding 'errors'\" refers to\ninnocence.\nThe same tone is found in the Qur'an in the words of Prophet Yusuf that:\nI exculpate not myself, verily (one's) self is wont to bid (him to) evil, except such\nas my Lord hath had mercy on; verily my Lord is Oft- forgiving, All-merciful.\n(12:53)\nJust as in this verse, because of the existence of exception, its firstpart cannot be used to\nargue against his innocence, similarly, due to the existence of the exception \"but that Allah\nhelps me in avoiding errors\" in Amir al-mu'minin's saying, its first part cannot be used to argue\nagainst his innocence, otherwise the Prophet's innocence too will have to be rejected.\nIn the same way, the last sentence of this sermon should not be taken to mean that before the\nproclamation of prophethood he had been under the influence of pre-Islamic beliefs, and that\njust as others had been unbelievers he too might have been in darkness and misguidance,\nbecause from his very birth Amir al-mu'minin was brought-up by the Prophet and the effect of\nhis training and up-bringing permeated him.\nIt cannot therefore be imagined that he who had from infancy trod in the foot-prints of the\nProphet would deviate from guidance even for a moment. Thus, al-Mas`udi has written:\nAmir al-mu'minin never believed in any other god than Allah so that there could\nbe the question of his accepting Islam. He rather followed the Prophet in all his\nactions and (virtually) initiated him, and in this very state he attained majority.\n(Muruj adh-dhahab, vol. 2, p. 3).\nHere, by those whom Allah led from darkness into guidance, the reference is to the persons\nwhom Amir al-muíminin was addressing. Ibn Abiíl-Hadid writes in this connection:\nThe reference here is not to his own self because he had never been an\nunbeliever so as to have accepted Islam after that, but in these words he is\nreferring to those group of people whom he was addressing. (Sharh Nahj albalaghah,\nvol. 11, p. 108)"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_217.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_217.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"lBkBzom0OB"}
