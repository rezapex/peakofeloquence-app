They replied that some of them were but some of them\nwere not. Amir al-mu'minin said:\nThen you divide yourselves into two groups. One of those who were in Siffin and other of\nthose who were not present there, so that I may address each as I see suitable. Then he\nshouted to the people:\nStop talking and keep quiet to listen to what I say. Turn your hearts to me. Whomever we ask\nfor evidence, he should give it according to his knowledge about it.\nThen he had a long conversation with them during which he said:\nWhen they had raised the Qur'an by way of deceit, craft, artifice and cheat, did you not say\n\"They are our brothers and our comrades in accepting Islam.\nThey want us to cease fighting, and ask for protection through the Book of Allah, the\nGlorified. Our opinion is to agree with them and to end their troubles.\" Then I said to you, \"In\nthis affair the outer side is Faith but the inner side is enmity.\nIts beginning is pity and the end is repentance. Consequently you should stick to your\nposition, and remain steadfast on your path. You should press your teeth (to put all your\nmight) in jihad and should not pay heed to the shouts of the shouter (2). If he is answered he\nwould mislead, but if he is left (unanswered) he would be disgraced.\"\nBut when this thing (Arbitration) was done I found that you agreed to it. By Allah, if I had\nrefused it, it would not have been obligatory on me. Nor would Allah have laid its sin on me.\nAnd by Allah, not that I have accepted it, I alone am the rightful person who should be\nfollowed, for certainly the Qur'an is with me. I never forsake it since I adopted its company.\nWe have been with the Prophet in battles wherein those killed were fathers, sons, brothers and\nrelations of one another. Nevertheless, every trouble and hardship just increased us in our\nbelief, in our treading on the right path, in submission to (divine) command and in endurance\nof the pain of wounds.\nWe now had to fight our brethren in Islam because of entry into Islam of misguidance,\ncrookedness, doubts and (wrong) interpretation. However, if we find any way by which Allah\nmay collect us together in our disorder and by which we may come near each other in\nwhatever common remains between us we would accept it and would give up everything else.\n(1). Ibn Abi'l-Hadid writes that this sermon comprises three parts which do not fit together,\nbecause as-Sayyid ar-Radi selected some parts of Amir al-mu'minin's sermons and did not\nrecord other parts as a result of which the continuity of utterance was not maintained.\nThus, one part ends at \"if he is left unanswered he would be disgraced\", the other at \"and\nendurance at the pain of wound\" and the third runs till the end of the sermon.
