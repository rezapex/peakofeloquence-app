Who made me such that I have not died nor am I sick, nor have my veins\nbeen infected with disease, nor have I been hauled up for my evil acts, nor am I without\nprogeny, nor have I forsaken my religion, nor do I disbelieve in my Lord, nor do I feel\nstrangeness with my faith, nor is my intelligence affected, nor have I been punished with the\npunishment of peoples before me.\nI am a slave in Thy possession, I have been guilty of excesses over myself. Thou hast\nexhausted Thy pleas over me and I have no plea (before Thee).\nI have no power to take except what Thou givest me, and I cannot evade except what Thou\nsavest me from. O' my Allah! I seek Thy protection from becoming destitute despite Thy\nriches, from being misguided despite Thy guidance, from being molested in Thy realm and\nfrom being humiliated while authority rests with Thee. O' my Allah! let my spirit be the first\nof those good objects that Thou takest from me and the first trust out of Thy favours held in\ntrust with me.\nO' my Allah! we seek Thy protection from turning away from Thy command or revolting\nagainst Thy religion, or being led away by our desires instead of by guidance that comes from\nThee."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_216.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_216.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"AGk4vfPLjc"}
