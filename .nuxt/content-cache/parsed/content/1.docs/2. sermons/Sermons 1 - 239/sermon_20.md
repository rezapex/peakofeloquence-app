When exactly the same problem is placed before another of them he passes an\nopposite verdict. Then these judges go to the chief who had appointed them and he confirms\nall the verdicts, although their Allah is One (and the same), their Prophet is one (and the\nsame), their Book (the Qur'an) is one (and the same).\nIs it that Allah ordered them to differ and they obeyed Him? Or He prohibited them from it\nbut they disobeyed Him? Or (is it that) Allah sent an incomplete Faith and sought their help to\ncomplete it? Or they are His partners in the affairs, so that it is their share of duty to\npronounce and He has to agree? Or is it that Allah the Glorified sent a perfect faith but the\nProphet fell short of conveying it and handing it over (to the people)? The fact is that Allah\nthe Glorified says:\n. . . We have not neglected anything in the Book (Qur'an) . . . (Qur'an, 6:38)\nAnd says that one part of the Qur'an verifies another part and that there is no divergence in it\nas He says:\n. . . And if it had been from any other than Allah, they would surely have found\nin it much discrepancy. (Qur'an, 4 :82)\nCertainly the outside of the Qur'an is wonderful and its inside is deep (in meaning). Its\nwonders will never disappear, its amazements will never pass away and its intricacies cannot\nbe cleared except through itself.\n(1). It is a disputed problem that where there is no clear argument about a matter in the\nreligious law, whether there does in reality exist an order about it or not. The view adopted by\nAbu'l-Hasan al-Ash"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"ari and his master Abu "}]},{"type":"text","value":"Ali al-Jubba'i is that in such a case Allah has not\nordained any particular course of action but He assigned the task of finding it out and passing\na verdict to the jurists so that whatever they hold as prohibited would be deemed prohibited\nand whatever they regard permissible would be deemed permissible. And if one has one view\nand the other another then as many verdicts will exist as there are views and each of them\nwould represent the final order.\nFor example, if one scholar holds that barley malt is prohibited and another jurist's view is that\nit is permissible then it would really be both prohibited and permissible. That is, for one who\nholds it prohibited, its use would be prohibited while for the other its use would be permissible.\nAbout this (theory of) correctness Muhammad ibn Abdi'l-Karim ash-Shahrastani writes:\nA group of theorists hold that in matters where ijtihad (research) is applied there is no settled\nview about permissibility or otherwise and lawfulness and prohibition thereof, but whatever the\nmujtahid (the researcher scholar) holds is the order of Allah, because the ascertainment of the\nview of Allah depends upon the verdict of the mujtahid. If it is not so there will be no verdict at\nall. And according to this view every mujtahid would be correct in his opinion. (al-Milal wa'lnihal,\np.98)\nIn this case, the mujtahid is taken to be above mistake because a mistake can be deemed to\noccur where a step is taken against reality, but where there is no reality of verdict, mistake has\nno sense. Besides this, the mujtahid can be considered to be above mistake if it is held that\nAllah, being aware of all the views that were likely to be adopted has ordained as many final\norders as a result of which every view corresponds to some such order, or that Allah has\nassured that the views adopted by the mujtahids should not go beyond what He has ordained,\nor that by chance the view of every one of them would, after all, correspond to some ordained\norder or other.\nThe Imamiyyah sect, however, has different theory, namely that Allah has neither assigned to\nanyone the right to legislate nor subjected any matter to the view of the mujtahid, nor in case\nof difference of views has He ordained numerous real orders. Of course, if the mujtahid cannot\narrive at a real order then whatever view he takes after research and probe, it is enough for\nhim and his followers to act by it.\nSuch an order is the apparent order which is a substitute for the real order. In this case, he is\nexcused for missing the real order, because he did his best for diving in the deep ocean and to\nexplore its bottom, but it is a pity that instead of pearls he got only the sea-shell. He does not\nsay that observers should except it as a pearl or it should sell as such. It is a different matter\nthat Allah who watches the endeavours may price it at half so that the endeavour does not go\nwaste, nor his passion discouraged.\nIf the theory of correctness is adopted then every verdict on law and every opinion shall have\nto be accepted as correct as Maybudhi has written in Fawatih:\nIn this matter the view adopted by al-Ash"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"ari is right.
