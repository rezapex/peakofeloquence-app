He is\ndetaining himself in ignorance.\nO' man! what has emboldened you to (commit) sins, what had deceived you about your Allah\nand what has made you satisfied with the destruction of yourself. Is there no cure for your\nailment or no awakening from your sleep? Do you not have pity on yourself as you have on\nothers? Generally, when you see anyone exposed to the heat of the sun you cover him with\nshade, or if you see anyone afflicted with grief that pains his body you weep out of pity for\nhim.\nWhat has then made you patient over your own disease, what has made you firm in your own\nafflictions, and what has consoled you from weeping over yourself although your life is the\nmost precious of all lives to you, and why does not the fear of an ailment that may befall you\nin the night keep you wakeful although you lie on the way to Allah's wrath due to your sins?\nYou should cure the disease of languor in your heart by determination, and the sleep of\nneglectfulness in your eyes by wakefulness. Be obedient to Allah, and love His remembrance,\nand picture to yourself that you are running away while He is approaching you. He is calling\nyou to His forgiveness and concealing your faults with His kindness, while you are fleeing\naway from Him towards others.\nCertainly, Great is Allah the powerful, Who is so generous, and how humble and weak are\nyou and still so bold to commit His disobedience although you live in His protection and\nundergo changes of life in the expanse of His kindness. He does not refuse you His kindness\nand does not remove His protection from you. In fact, you have not been without His\nkindness even for a moment, whether it be a favour that He conferred upon you or a sin of\nyours that He has concealed or a calamity that He has warded off from you.\nWhat is your idea about Him if you had obeyed Him? By Allah, if this had been the case with\ntwo persons equal in power and matching in might (one being inattentive and the other\nshowering favours upon you) then you would have been the first to adjudge yourself to be of\nbad behaviour and evil deeds.\nI truthfully say that the world has not deceived you but you have had yourself deceived by it.\nThe world had opened to you the curtains and divulged to you (everything) equally. And in all\nthat it foretold you about the troubles befalling your bodies and the decay in your power, it\nhas been too true and faithful in promise, and did not speak a lie to you or deceive you.\nThere are many who advise you about it but they are blamed, and speak the truth about it but\nthey are opposed. If you understand the world by means of dilapidated houses and forlorn\nabodes, then with your good understanding and far reaching power of drawing lessons you\nwill find it like one who is kind over you and cautious about you.\nIt is good abode for him who does not like it as an abode, and a good place of stay for him\nwho does not regard it a permanent home for stay.\nOnly those who run away from this world today will be regarded virtuous tomorrow. When\nthe earthquake occurs, the Day of Resurrection approaches with all its severities, the people\nof every worshipping place cling to it, all the devotees cling to the object of their devotion\nand all the followers cling to their leader.\nThen on that day even the opening of an eye in the air and the sound of a footstep on the\nground will be assigned its due through His Justice and His Equity. On that day many an\nargument will prove void and a contention for excuses will stand rejected.\nTherefore, you should now adopt for yourself the course with which your excuse may hold\ngood and your plea may be proved. Take from the transient things of this world that which\nwill stay for you (in the next world), provide for your journey, keep (your) gaze on the\nbrightness of deliverance and keep ready the saddles (for setting off)."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_223.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_223.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"gJ8jVdY2UD"}
