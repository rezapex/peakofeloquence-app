He is such First that there is no extremity for Him so that He be contained within it, nor\nis there an end for Him where would cease.\nA part of the same sermon about the Prophet\nAllah kept the Prophets in deposit in the best place of deposit and made them stay in the best\nplace of stay. He moved them in succession from distinguished fore-fathers to chaste wombs.\nWhenever a predecessor from among them died the follower stood up for the cause of the\nreligion of Allah.\nAbout the Holy Prophet and his Descendants (`Itrah)\nUntil this distinction of Allah, the Glorified, reached Muhammad - peace and blessing of\nAllah be upon him and his descendants. Allah brought him out from the most distinguished\nsources of origin and the most honourable places of planting, namely from the same (lineal)\ntree from which He brought forth other Prophets and from which He selected His trustees.\nMuhammad's descendants are the best descendants, his kinsmen the best of kin and his lineal\ntree the best of trees. It grew in esteem and rose in distinction. It has tall branches and\nunapproachable fruits.\nHe is the leader (Imam) of all who exercise fear (of Allah) and a light for those who seek\nguidance. He is a lamp whose flame is burning, a meteor whose light is shining and a flint\nwhose spark is bright. His conduct is upright, his behaviour is guiding, his speech is decisive\nand his decision is just.\nAllah sent him after an interval from the previous Prophets when people had fallen into errors\nof action and ignorance. Allah may have mercy on you.\nMay Allah shower His mercy on you ! Do act according to the clear signs, because the way is\nstraight and leads to the house of safety while you are in the place of seeking Allah's favour,\nand have time and opportunity.\nThe books (of your doings) are open and pens (of angels) are busy (to record your actions)\nwhile your bodies are healthy, tongues are free, repentance is accepted and deeds are\naccorded recognition."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_95.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_95.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"9cEgA6KPBD"}
