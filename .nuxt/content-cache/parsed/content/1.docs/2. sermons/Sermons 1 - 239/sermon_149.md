They do not employ any connection for getting\naccess to Allah nor proceed towards Him through any means. Both of them bear malice\nagainst the other.\nShortly his veil over it will be uncovered. By Allah, if they achieve what they aim at, one of\nthem will kill the other, and one will finish the other.\nThe rebellious party has stood up. Where are the seekers of virtue; for the paths have already\nbeen determined and they have been given the news. For every misguidance there is a cause\nand for every break of pledge there is a misrepresentation.\nBy Allah, I shall not be like him who listens to the voice of mourning, hears the man who\nbrings news of death and also visits the mourner yet does not take lesson."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_149.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_149.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"tMetkoAzjk"}
