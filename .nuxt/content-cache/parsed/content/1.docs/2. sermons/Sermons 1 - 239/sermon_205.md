Provide yourselves for the journey because the call for\ndeparture has been announced. Regard your stay in the world as very short, and return (to\nAllah) with the best provision that is with you, because surely, in front of you lies a valley,\ndifficult to climb, and places of stay full of fear and dangers.\nYou have to reach there and stay in them. And know that the eyes of death are approaching\ntowards you. It is as though you are (already) in its talons and it has struck itself against you.\nDifficult affairs and distressing dangers have crushed you into it.\nYou should therefore cut away all the attachments of this world and assist yourselves with the\nprovision of Allah's fear.\nas-Sayyid ar-Radi says: A part of this saying has been quoted before through another\nnarration."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_205.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_205.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"KhMEBHfhMP"}
