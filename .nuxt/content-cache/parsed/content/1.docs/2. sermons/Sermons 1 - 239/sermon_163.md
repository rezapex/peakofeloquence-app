Time has made me laugh after weeping. No wonder, by Allah; what is this affair which surpasses all wonder and which has increased wrongfulness. These people have tried to put out the flame of Allah's light from His lamp and to close His fountain from its source. They mixed epidemic-producing water between me and themselves. If the trying hardships were removed from among us, I would take them on the course of truthfulness otherwise: \"... So let not thy self go (in vain) in grief for them; verily Allah knoweth all that they do.\" (Qur'an, 35:8) (1). This is a hemistich from the couplet of the famous Arab poet Imriu'l-Qays al-Kindi. The second hemistich is: \"And let me know the story of what happened to the riding camels.\" The incident behind this couplet is that when the father of Imriu'l-Qays namely Hujr ibn al-Harith was killed, he roamed about the various Arab tribes to avenge his father's life with their help. In this connection he stayed with a man of Jadilah (tribe) but finding himself unsafe left that place, and stayed with Khalid ibn Sadus an-Nabhani.

When Imriu'l-Qays came to know this he composed a\nfew couplets out of which this is one. It means 'now you leave the story of these camels which\nwere robbed but now let me know about the she-camels snatched from my hands.'\nAmir al-mu'minin's intention in quoting this verse as an illustration is that \"Now that Mu`awiyah\nis at war, we should talk about and should leave the discussion about the devastation\nengendered by those who had usurped my rights.\nThat time has gone away. Now is the time for grappling with the mischiefs of the hour.\nSo discuss the event of the moment and do not start untimely strain.\" Amir al-mu'minin said\nthis because the man had put the question to him at the time of the battle of Siffin, when the\nbattle was raging and bloodshed was in full swing."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_163.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_163.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"JsLUfV4yRH"}
