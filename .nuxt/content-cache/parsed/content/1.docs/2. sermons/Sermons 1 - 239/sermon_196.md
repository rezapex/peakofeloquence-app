I stand witness that there is\nno god but Allah by virtue of belief, certainty, sincerity and conviction.\nI also stand witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Prophet whom He deputed when the\nsigns of guidance were obliterated and the ways of religion were desolate. So, he threw open\nthe truth, gave advice to the people, guided them towards righteousness and ordered them to\nbe moderate. May Allah bless him and his descendants.\nKnow, O' creatures of Allah, that He has not created you for nought and has not left you free.\nHe knows the extent of His favours over you and the quantity of His bounty towards you.\nTherefore, ask Him for success and for the attainment of aims. Beg before Him and seek His\ngenerosity. No curtain hides you from Him, nor is any door closed before you against Him.\nHe is at every place, in every moment and every instance. He is with every man and jinn.\nGiving does not create any breach in Him. Gifting does not cause Him diminution. A beggar\ncannot exhaust Him and paying (to others) cannot take Him to the end.\nOne person cannot turn His attention from another, one voice does not detract Him from\nanother voice, and one grant of favour does not prevent Him from refusing another favour.\nAnger does not prevent Him from mercy, mercy does not prevent Him from punishing; His\nconcealment does not hide His manifestness and His manifestness does not prevent Him from\nconcealment. He is near and at the same time distant. He is high and at the same time low.\nHe is manifest and also concealed. He is concealed yet well-known. He lends but is not lent\nanything. He has not created (the things of) creation after devising, nor did He take their\nassistance on account of fatigue.\nI advise you, O' creatures of Allah, to have fear of Allah, for it is the rein and the mainstay (of\nreligion). Hold fast to its salient points, keep hold of its realities. It will take you to abodes of\neasiness, places of comfort, fortresses of safety and houses of honour on the Day (of\nJudgement) when eyes will be wide open, (Qur'an, 14:42), when there will be darkness all\nround, when small groups of camels pregnant for ten months will be allowed free grazing, and\nwhen the Horn will be blown, then every living being will die, every voice will become dumb\nthe high mountains and hard rocks will crumble (to pieces) so that their hard stones will turn\ninto moving sand and their bases will become level. (On that day) there will be no interceder\nto intercede and no relation to ward off (trouble), and no excuse will be of avail."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_196.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_196.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"lvLZSDG6Qy"}
