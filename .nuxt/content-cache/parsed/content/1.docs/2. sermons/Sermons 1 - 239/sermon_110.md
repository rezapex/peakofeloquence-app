He is the satisfaction of every poor,\ndignity of the low, energy for the weak and shelter for the oppressed.\nWhoever speaks, He hears his speaking, and whoever keeps quiet, He knows his secret. On\nHim is the livelihood of everyone who lives, and to Him returns whoever dies.\n(O' Allah!) The eyes have not seen Thee so as to be aware of Thee, but Thou wert before the\ndescribers of Thy creation. Thou didst not create the creation on account of loneliness, nor\ndidst make them work for gain. He whom Thou catchest cannot go farther than Thee, and he\nwhom Thou holdest cannot escape Thee. He who disobeys Thee does not decrease Thy\nauthority, and he who obeys Thee does not add to Thy Might. He who disagrees with Thy\njudgement cannot turn it, and he who turns away from Thy command cannot do without Thee.\nEvery secret before Thee is open and for Thee every absent is present.\nThou art everlasting, there is no end to Thee. Thou art the highest aim, there is no escape from\nThee, Thou art the promised (point of return) from which there is no deliverance except\ntowards Thee. In Thy hand is the forelock of every creature and to Thee is the return of every\nliving being.\nGlory to Thee! How great is Thy creation that we see, but how small is this greatness by the\nside of Thy Might. How awe-striking is Thy realm that we notice, but how humble is this\nagainst what is hidden from us out of Thy authority. How extensive are Thy bounties in this\nworld, but how small are they against the bounties of the next world.\nA part of the same sermon about the Angels\nThou (O' Allah) made angels reside in Thy skies and place them high above from Thy earth.\nThey have the most knowledge about Thee and Thy whole creation, the most fearing from\nThee, and the nearest to Thee. They never stayed in loins nor were retained in wombs. They\nwere not created \"from mean water (semen)\" (Qur'an , 32:8; 77:20). They were not dispersed\nby vicissitudes of time. They are on their places (distinct) from Thee and in their positions\nnear Thee. Their desires are concentrated in Thee. Their worship for Thee is much. Their\nneglect from Thy command is little.\nIf they witness what remains hidden about Thee they would regard their deeds as very little,\nthey would criticise themselves and would realise that they did not worship Thee according to\nThy right for being worshipped and did not obey Thee as Thou hast the right of being obeyed.\nAbout the bounties and guidance of Allah, and those who are ungrateful\nGlorified art Thou, the Creator, the Worshipped, on account of Thy good trials of Thy\ncreatures. Thou created a house (the Paradise) and provided in it for feasting, drinks, foods,\nspouses, servants, places, streams, plantations and fruits.\nThen Thou sent a messenger to invite towards it, but the people did not respond to the caller,\nand did not feel persuaded to what Thou persuaded them nor showed eagerness towards what\nThou desired them to feel eager. They jumped on the carcass (of this world), earned shame by\neating it and became united on loving it.\nWhen one loves a thing it blinds him and sickens his heart. Then he sees but with a diseased\neye, hears but with unhearing ears. Desires have cut asunder his wit, and the world has made\nhis heart dead, while his mind is all longing for it. Consequently, he is a slave of it and of\neveryone who has any share in it.\nWherever it turns, he turns towards it and wherever it proceeds, he proceeds towards it. He is\nnot desisted by any desister from Allah, nor takes admonition from any preacher. He sees\nthose who have been caught in neglect whence there is neither rescission nor reversion.\nAbout Death\nWhatever they were ignoring has befallen them, separation from this world, from which they\ntook themselves safe, has come to them and they have reached that in the next world which\nthey had been promised. Whatever has befallen them cannot be described. Pangs of death and\ngrief for losing (this world) have surrounded them.\nConsequently, their limbs become languid and their complexion changes. Then death\nincreases its struggle over them.\nIn some one it stands in between him and his power of speaking although he lies among his\npeople, looking with eyes, hearing with his ears, with full wits and intelligence. He then\nthinks over how he wasted his life and in what (activities) he passed his time. He recalls the\nwealth he collected when he had blinded himself in seeking it, and acquired it from fair and\nfoul sources.\nNow the consequences of collecting it have overtaken him. He gets ready to leave it. It would\nremain for those who are behind him. They would enjoy it and benefit by it.\nIt would be an easy acquisition for others but a burden on his back, and the man cannot get rid\nof it. He would thereupon bite his hands with teeth out of shame for what was disclosed to\nhim about his affairs at the time of his death.\nHe would dislike what he coveted during the days of his life and would wish that he who\nenvied him on account of it and felt jealous over him for it should have amassed it instead of\nhe himself.\nDeath would go on affecting his body till his ears too would behave like his tongue (and lose\nfunctioning). So he would lie among his people, neither speaking with his tongue or hearing\nwith his ears.\nHe would be rotating his glance over their faces, watching the movements of their tongues,\nbut not hearing their speaking. Then death would increase its sway over him, and his sight\nwould be taken by death as the ears had been taken and the spirit would depart from his body.\nHe would then become a carcass among his own people.\nThey would feel loneliness from him and get away from near him. He would not join a\nmourner or respond to a caller. Then they would carry him to a small place in the ground and\ndeliver him in it to (face) his deeds. They abandoned visiting him.\nAbout the Day of Judgement\nTill whatever is written as ordained approaches its end, the affairs complete their destined\nlimits, the posteriors join the anteriors and whatever Allah wills takes place in the shape of\nresurrection of His creation. Then He would convulse the sky and split it.\nHe would quake the earth and shake it. He would root out the mountains and scatter them.\nThey would crush each other out of awe of His Glory and fear of His Dignity.\nHe would take out everyone who is in it. He would refresh them after they had been worn out\nand collect them after they had been separated. Then He would set them apart for questioning\nabout the hidden deeds and secret acts. He would then divide them into two groups, rewarding\none and punishing the other.\nAs regards the obedient people He would reward them with His nearness and would keep\nthem for ever in His house from where those who settle therein do not move out. Their\nposition would not undergo change, fear would not overtake them, ailments would not befall\nthem, dangers would not affect them and journey would not force them (from place to place).\nAs for people of sins, He would settle them in the worst place, would bind their hands with\nthe necks, bind the forelocks with feet and would clothe them in shirts of tar and dresses cut\nout of flames. They would be in punishment whose heat would be severe, door would be\nclosed on the inmates - in fire which is full of shouts and cries and rising flames and fearful\nvoices.\nIts inmate does not move out of it. its prisoner cannot be released by ransom and its shackles\ncannot be cut. There is no fixed age for this house so that it might perish, nor period for its\nlife that might pass away.\nA part of the same sermon about the Holy Prophet\nHe treated this world disdainfully and regarded it low. He held it contemptible and hated it.\nHe realised that Allah kept it away from him with intention and spread it out for others by\nway of contempt. Therefore, he remained away from it by his heart, banished its recollection\nfrom his mind and wished that its attraction should remain hidden from his eye so that he\nshould not acquire any clothing from it, or hope for staying in it.\nHe conveyed from Allah the pleas (against committing sins), counselled his people as a\nwarner (against Divine chastisement) and called (people) towards Paradise as a conveyor of\ngood tidings.\nAbout the Descendants of the Holy Prophet\nWe are the tree of prophethood, staying place of (Divine) Message, descending place of\nangels, mines of knowledge and the sources of wisdom. Our supporter and lover awaits mercy\nwhile our enemy and he who hates us awaits wrath."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_110.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_110.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"eqronIXFui"}
