One is he who is\ndevoted to his self. So he is deviated from the true path and loves speaking about (foul)\ninnovations and inviting towards wrong path. He is therefore a nuisance for those who are\nenamoured of him, is himself misled from the guidance of those preceding him, misleads\nthose who follow him in his life or after his death, carries the weight of others' sins and is\nentangled in his own misdeeds.\nThe other man is he who has picked up ignorance. He moves among the ignorant, is senseless\nin the thick of mischief and is blind to the advantages of peace. Those resembling like men\nhave named him scholar but he is not so. He goes out early morning to collect things whose\ndeficiency is better than plenty, till when he has quenched his thirst from polluted water and\nacquired meaningless things.\nHe sits among the people as a judge responsible for solving whatever is confusing to the\nothers. If an ambiguous problem is presented before him he manages shabby argument about\nit of his own accord and passes judgement on its basis. In this way he is entangled in the\nconfusion of doubts as in the spider's web, not knowing whether he was right or wrong. If he\nis right he fears lest he erred, while if he is wrong he hopes he is right. He is ignorant,\nwandering astray in ignorance and riding on carriages aimlessly moving in darkness. He did\nnot try to find reality of knowledge. He scatters the traditions as the wind scatters the dry\nleaves.\nBy Allah, he is not capable of solving the problems that come to him nor is fit for the position\nassigned to him. Whatever he does not know he does not regard it worth knowing. He does\nnot realise that what is beyond his reach is within the reach of others. If anything is not clear\nto him he keeps quiet over it because he knows his own ignorance. Lost lives are crying\nagainst his unjust verdicts, and properties (that have been wrongly disposed of) are grumbling\nagainst him.\nI complain to Allah about persons who live ignorant and die misguided. For them nothing is\nmore worthless than Qur'an if it is recited as it should be recited, nor anything more valuable\nthan the Qur'an if its verses are removed from their places, nor anything more vicious than\nvirtue nor more virtuous than vice.\n(1). Amir al-mu'minin has held two categories of persons as the most detestable by Allah and\nthe worst among people. Firstly, those who are misguided even in basic tenets and are busy in\nthe spreading of evil. Secondly, those who abandon the Qur'an and sunnah and pronounce\ninjunctions through their imagination. They create a circle of their devotees and popularise the\nreligious code of law concocted by themselves.\nThe misguidance and wrongfulness of such persons does not remain confined to their own\nselves but the seed of misguidance sown by them bears fruit and growing into the form of a\nbig tree provides asylum to the misguided and this misguidance goes on multiplying. And since\nthese very people are the real originators the weight of other's sins is also on their shoulders\nas the Qur'an says:\nAnd certainly they shall bear their own burdens, and (other) burdens with their own burdens...\n(29:13)\nReturn to Table of Contents.\nForward to"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_17.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_17.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"kLeN1NsdEz"}
