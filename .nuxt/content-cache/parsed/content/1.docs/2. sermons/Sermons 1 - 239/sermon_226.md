Its conditions do\nnot last and those who inhabit it do not remain safe. Its conditions are variable and its ways\nchanging.\nLife in it is blameworthy and safety in it is non-existent. Yet its people are targets; it strikes\nthem with its arrows and destroys them through death.\nKnow, O' creatures of Allah, that, certainly, you and all the things of this world that you have\nare (treading) on the lines of those (who were) before you. They were of longer ages, had\nmore populated houses and were of more lasting traces.\nTheir voices have become silent, their movements have become stationary, their bodies have\nbecome rotten, their houses have become empty and their traces have been obliterated. Their\nmagnificent places and spread-out carpets were changed to stones, laid-in-blocks and cavelike\ndug out graves whose very foundation is based on ruins and whose construction has been\nmade with soil.\nTheir positions are contiguous, but those settled in them are like far flung strangers. They are\namong the people of their area but feel lonely, and they are free from work but still engaged\n(in activity). They feel no attachment with homelands nor do they keep contact among\nthemselves like neighbours despite nearness of neighbourhood and priority of abodes.\nAnd how can they meet each other when decay has ground them with its chest, and stones and\nearth have eaten them.\nIt is as though you too have gone where they have gone, the same sleeping place has caught\nyou and the same place has detained you. What will then be your position when your affairs\nreach their end and graves are turned upside down (to throw out the dead)?\nThere shall every soul realise what it hath sent before, and they shall be brought\nback to Allah, their true Lord, and what they did fabricate (the false deities)\nwill vanish (away) from them.
