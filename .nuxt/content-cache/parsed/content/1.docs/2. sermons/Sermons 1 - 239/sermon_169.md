I am not ignorant of what you know, but how do I have the power for it while\nthose who assaulted him are in the height of their power. They have superiority over us, not\nwe over them. They are now in the position that even your slaves have risen with them and\nBedouin Arabs too have joined them. They are now among you and are harming you as they\nlike. Do you see any way to be able to do what you aim at?\nThis demand is certainly that of the pre-Islamic (al-jahiliyyah) period and these people have\nsupport behind them. When the matter is taken up, people will have different views about it.\nOne group will think as you do, but another will not think as you think, and there will be still\nanother group who will be neither this way nor that way. Be patient till people quieten down\nand hearts settle in their places so that rights can be achieved for people easily.\nRest assured from me, and see what is given to you by me. Do not do anything which shatters\nyour power, weakens your strength and engenders feebleness and disgrace. I shall control this\naffair as far as possible, but if I find it necessary the last treatment will, of course, be branding\nwith a hot iron (through fighting)."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_169.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_169.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"7m8yptEMJB"}
