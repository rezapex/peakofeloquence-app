He is falling into error along with negligent persons and\ngoes early in the morning with sinners, without any road to lead or any Imam to guide.\nA part of the same sermon\nAt last when Allah will make clear to them the reward for their sins, and take them out from\nthe veils of their neglectfulness they will proceed to what they were running away from, and\nrun away from what they were proceeding to. They will not benefit from the wants they will\nsatisfy or the desires they would fulfil.\nI warn you and myself from this position. A man should derive benefit from his own self.\nCertainly, prudent is he who hears and ponders over it, who sees and observes and who\nbenefits from instructive material and then treads on clear paths wherein he avoids falling into\nhollows and straying into pitfalls, and does not assist those who misguide him by turning\naway from truthfulness, changing his words, or fearing truth.\nO' my listener! Be cured from your intoxication, wake up from your slumber, decrease your\nhasty activity and ponder over what has come to you through the Holy Prophet, the Ummi (1)\nwhich is inevitable and inescapable. You should turn away from him who opposes him and\nleave him and leave whatever he has adopted for himself. Put off your vanity, drop your\nhaughtiness and recall your grave because your way passes over it.\nYou will be dealt with as you deal with others, you will reap what you sow, and what you\nsend today will meet you tomorrow. So provide for your future and send (some good acts) for\nyour day (of reckoning). Fear, fear, O' listener! Act, act, O' careless! No one will warn you\nlike him who knows.\nOne of the firm decisions of Allah in the Wise Reminder (Qur'an) upon which He bestows\nreward or gives punishment, and through which He likes or dislikes is that it will not benefit a\nman, even though he exerts himself and acts sincerely if he leaves this world to meet Allah\nwith one of these acts without repenting, namely that he believed in a partner with Allah\nduring his obligatory worship, or appeased his own anger by killing an individual, or spoke\nabout acts committed by others, or sought fulfilment of his needs from people by introducing\nan innovation in his religion, or met people with a double face, or moved among them with a\ndouble tongue.\nUnderstand this because an illustration is a guide for its like.\nBeasts are concerned with their bellies. Carnivores are concerned with assaulting others.\nWomen are concerned with the adornments of this ignoble life and the creation of mischief\nherein (2). (On the other hand) believers are humble, believers are admonishers and believers\nare afraid (of Allah).\n(1). The word \"ummi\" has been used in the Holy Qur'an with reference to the Holy Prophet in\nchapter 7:157-158. For better understanding of the word refer to the books of commentary on\nthe Holy Qur'an. (2). The intention is to say that the cause of all mischief and evil is the\npassion to satisfy bodily needs and the passion to subdue.\nIf a human being is subjugated by the passion to satisfy bodily needs and considers filling the\nstomach as his aim there will be no difference between him and a beast, because a beast too\nhas no aim except to fill its belly.\nBut if he is over-powered by the passion to subdue others and takes to killing and devastation\nthere will be no difference between him and a carnivorous beast, because the latter's aim is\nalso tearing and devouring.\nIf both the passions are at work in him then he is like a woman, because in a woman both\nthese passions act side by side and because of this she is extremely eager of adornment and is\nactive in fanning mischief and disturbance.\nHowever, a true believer will never agree to adopt these habits as his mode of behaviour,\nrather he keeps his passions suppressed so that he neither allows pride and vanity to approach\nnear him nor does he fan mischief or disturbance for fear of Allah.\nIbn Abi'l-Hadid has written that Amir al-mu'minin delivered this sermon at the time of marching\ntowards Basrah, and since the trouble of Basrah was the result of a woman's instigation, Amir\nal-mu'minin has, after mentioning beasts and carnivore, held a woman also to possess such\nqualities. Thus the battle of Basrah was the result of these qualities, whereby thousands of\npersons were involved in death and destruction."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":",. ,. ,.\n,. ,. ,.\n,. ,. ,.\n,."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_154.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_154.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"2gybnw4NEg"}
