Today is the day of preparation\nwhile tomorrow is the day of race. The place to proceed to is Paradise while the place of\ndoom is Hell. Is there no one to offer repentance over his faults before his death? Or is there\nno one to perform virtuous acts before the day of trial?\nBeware, surely you are in the days of hopes behind which stands death. Whoever acts during\nthe days of his hope before approach of his death, his action would benefit him and his death\nwould not harm him. But he who fails to act during the period of hope before the approach of\ndeath his action is a loss and his death is a harm to him. Beware, and act during a period of\nattraction just as you act during a period of dread. Beware, surely I have not seen a coveter for\nParadise asleep nor a dreader from Hell to be asleep. Beware, he whom right does not benefit\nmust suffer the harm of the wrong, and he whom guidance does not keep firm will be led\naway by misguidance towards destruction.\nBeware, you have been ordered insistently to march and been guided how to provide for the\njourney. Surely the most frightening thing which I am afraid of about you is to follow desires\nand to widen the hopes. Provide for yourself from this world what would save you tomorrow\n(on the Day of Judgement).\nas-Sayyid ar-Radi says: If there could be an utterance which would drag by neck towards\nrenunciation in this world and force to action for the next world, it is this sermon. It is enough\nto cut off from the entanglements of hopes and to ignite the flames of preaching (for virtue)\nand warning (against vice). His most wonderful words in this sermon are \"Today is the day of\npreparation while tomorrow is the day of race. The place to proceed to is Paradise while the\nplace of doom is Hell,\" because besides sublimity of words, greatness of meaning, true\nsimiles and factual illustrations, there are wonderful secrets and delicate implications therein.\nIt is his saying that he place to proceed to is Paradise while the place of doom is Hell. Here he\nhas used two different words to convey two different meanings. For Paradise he has used the\nword \"the place to proceed to\" but for Hell this word has not been used. One proceeds to a\nplace which he likes and desires, and this can be true for Paradise only. Hell does not have the\nattractiveness that it may be liked or proceeded to. We seek Allah's protection from it. Since\nfor Hell it was not proper to say \"to be proceeded to\" Amir al-mu'minin employed the word\n\"doom\" implying the last place of stay where one reaches even though it may mean grief and\nworry or happiness and pleasure.\nThis word is capable of conveying both senses. However, it should be taken in the sense of\n\"al-masir\" or \"al-ma'al\", that is, last resort. Qur'anic verse is \"say thou \"Enjoy ye (your\npleasures yet a while ), for your last resort is unto the (hell) fire\" (14:30). Here to say\n\"sabqatakum\" that is, \"the place for you to proceed to\" in place of the word \"masirakum\" that\nis, your doom or last resort would not be proper in any way. Think and ponder over it and see\nhow wondrous is its inner implication and how far its depth goes with beauty. Amir almu'minin's\nutterance is generally on these lines. In some versions the word \"sabqah\" is shown\nas \"subqah\" which is applied to reward fixed for the winner in a race. However, both the\nmeanings are near each other, because a reward is not for an undesirable action but for good\nand commendable performance."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_30.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_30.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"ZSziLE4Ke9"}
