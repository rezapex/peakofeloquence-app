He\ncreated the creation with His Might, and receives the devotion of rulers by virtue of His\ndignity.\nHe exercises superiority over great men through His generosity. It is He who made His\ncreation to populate the world and sent towards the jinn and human beings His messengers to\nunveil it for them, to warn them of its harm, to present to them its examples, to show them its\ndefects and to place before them a whole collection of matters containing lessons about the\nchangings of health and sickness in this world, its lawful things and unlawful things and all\nthat Allah has ordained for the obedient and the disobedient, namely, Paradise and Hell and\nhonour and disgrace. I extend my praise to His Being as He desires His creation to praise Him.\nHe has fixed for everything a measure, for every measure a time limit, and for every time\nlimit a document.\nA part of the same sermon\nAbout the greatness and importance of the Holy Qur'an\nThe Qur'an orders as well as refrains, remains silent and also speaks. It is the proof of Allah\nbefore His creation. He has taken from them a pledge (to act) upon it. He has perfected its\neffulgence, and completed through it His religion. He let the Prophet leave this world when he\nhad conveyed to the people all His commands of guidance through the Qur'an.\nYou should therefore regard Allah great as he has held Himself great, because He has not\nconcealed anything of His religion from you, nor has He left out anything which He likes or\nwhich He dislikes, but He made for it a clear emblem (of guidance) and a definite sign which\neither refrains from it or calls towards it. His pleasure is the same for all time to come.\nYou should know that He will not be pleased with you for anything for which He was\ndispleased with those before you, and He will not be displeased with you for anything for\nwhich He was pleased with those before you. You are treading on a clear path, and are\nspeaking the same as the people before you had spoken. Allah is enough for your needs in this\nworld. He has persuaded you to remain thankful, and has made it obligatory on you to\nmention Him with your tongues.\nWarning against punishment on the Day of Judgement\nHe has advised you to exercise fear and has made it the highest point of His pleasure and all\nthat He requires from His creatures. You should therefore fear Allah, who is such that you are\nas though just in front of Him, and your forelocks are in His grip, and your change of position\nis in His control. If you conceal a matter, He will know of it.\nIf you disclose a matter, He will record it. For this He has appointed honoured guards (angels)\nwho do not omit any rightful matter nor include anything incorrect. You should know that\nwhoever fears Allah, He would make for him a way to get out of troubles and (grant him) a\nlight (to help him) out of darkness.\nHe will ever keep him in whatever condition) he wishes, and will make him stay in a position\nof honour near Himself, in the house which He has made for Himself.\nThe shade of this house is His house is His throne, its light is His effulgence, its visitors are\nHis angels and its companions are His prophets.\nTherefore, hasten towards the place of return and go ahead of (your) deaths (by collecting\nprovision for the next world). Shortly, the expectations of the people will be cut short and\ndeath will overtake them while the door of repentance will be closed for them. You are still in\na place to which those who were before you have been wishing to return.\nIn this world, which is not your house, you are just a traveller in motion. You have been given\nthe call to leave from here, and you have been ordered to collect provision while you are here.\nYou should know that this thin skin cannot tolerate the Fire (of Hell). So, have pity on\nyourselves because you have already tried it in the tribulations of the world.\nHave you ever seen the crying of a person who has been pricked with a thorn or who bleeds\ndue to stumbling or whom hot sand has burnt? How would he feel when he is between two\nfrying pans of Hell with stones all round with Satan as his companion? Do you know that\nwhen Malik (the guard-in-charge of Hell) is angry with the fire, its parts begin to clash with\neach other (in rage), and, when he scolds it, it leaps between the doors of Hell crying on\naccount of his scolding.\nO' you old and big whom old age has made hoary, how will you feel when rings of fire will\ntouch the bones of your neck, and handcuffs hold so hard that they eat away the flesh of the\nforearms? (Fear) Allah ! Allah! O' crowd of men, while you are in good health before\nsickness (grips you) and you are in ease before straitness (overtakes you).\nYou should try for the release of your necks before their mortgage is foreclosed, your eyes,\nthin down bellies, use your feet, spend your money, take your bodies and spend them over\nyourselves, and do not be niggardly about them, because Allah the Glorified, has said:\n... if you help (in the way) of Allah, He will(also) help you, and will set firm\nyour feet. (Qur'an, 47:7)\nand He, the Sublime. has said:\nWho is he who would loan unto Allah a goodly loan? so that He may double it\nfor him, and for him shall be a noble recompense. (Qur'an, 57:11)\nHe does not seek your support because of any weakness, nor does He demand a loan from\nyou because of shortage. He seeks your help, although He possesses all the armies of the skies\nand the earth and He is strong and wise. He seeks a loan from you, although He owns the\ntreasures of the skies and the earth and He is rich and praiseworthy.\n(Rather) He intends to try you as to which of you performs good acts. You should therefore\nbe quick in performance of (good) acts so that your way be with His neighbours in His abode;\nHe made His Prophet's companions of these neighbours and made the angels to visit them. He\nhas honoured their ears so that the sound of Hell fire may never reach them, and He has\nafforded protection to their bodies from weariness and fatigue.\n. . . that is the grace of Allah, He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth;\nand Allah is the Lord of Mighty Grace. (Qur'an, 57:21)\nI say you are hearing. I seek Allah's help for myself and yourselves. He is enough for me and\nHe is the best dispenser."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_184.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_184.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"wQvdASfarO"}
