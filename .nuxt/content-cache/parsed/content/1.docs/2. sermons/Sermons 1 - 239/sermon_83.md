Whoever is rich here faces mischief and whoever is poor gets grief. One\nwho hankers after it does not get it. If one keeps away from it then it advances towards him.\nIf one sees through it, it would bestow him sight, but if one has his eye on it then it would\nblind him.\nas-Sayyid ar-Radi says: If a thinker thinks over this phrase of Amir al-mu'minin \"waman\nabsara biha bassarat'hu\" (\"If one sees through it, it would bestow him sight\") he would find\nthereunder very amazing meaning and far-reaching sense whose purpose cannot be\nappreciated and whose aim cannot be understood particularly when he joins it with Amir almu'minin's\nphrase \"waman absara ilayha a`mat'hu\" (\"If one, has his eye on it, them it would\nblind him) he would find the difference between \"absara biha\" and \"absara laha\", clear,\nbright, wonderful and shining.\n(1). \"The beginning of the world is grief and its end is destruction.\" This sentence contains the\nsame truth which the Qur'an has presented in the verse:\nIndeed We have created man (to dwell) amidst hardship. (90:4)\nIt is true that right from the narrow womb of the mother upto the vastness of the firmament\nthe changes of human life do not come to an end.\nWhen man first tastes life he finds himself closed in such a dark prison where he can neither\nmove the limbs nor change the sides.\nWhen he gets rid of this confinement and steps in this world he has to pass through\ninnumerable troubles. In the beginning he can neither speak with the tongue so as to describe\nhis difficulty or pain nor possesses energy in the limbs so as to accomplish his needs himself.\nOnly his suppressed sobs and flowing tears express his needs and translate his grief and\nsorrow. When after the lapse of this period he enters the stage of learning and instruction,\nthen on every step voices of admonition and abuse welcome him. All the time he seems\nfrightened and terrified.\nWhen he is relieved of this period of subjugation he finds himself surrounded by the worries of\nfamily life and livelihood, where sometimes, there is clash with comrades in profession,\nsometimes collision with enemies, sometimes confrontation with vicissitudes of time,\nsometimes attack of ailments and sometimes shock of children, till old age approaches him\nwith the tidings of helplessness and weakness, and eventually he bids farewell to this world\nwith mortification and grief in the heart.\nThereafter Amir al-mu'minin says about this world, that in its lawful actions there is the\nquestion of reckoning and in its forbidden acts there are hardships of punishment, as a result\nof which even pleasant joys also produce bitterness in his palate.\nIf there is plenty of wealth and money in this world then man finds himself in such a whirlpool\n(of worries) that he loses his joy and peace of mind.\nBut if there is want and poverty, he is ever crying for wealth. He who hankers after this world\nthere is no limit for his desires. If one wish is fulfilled the desire for fulfilment of another wish\ncrops up.\nThis world is like the reflection. If you run after it then it will itself run forward but if you leave\nit and run away from it then it follows you. In the same way, if a person does not run after the\nworld, the world runs after him. The implication is that if a person breaks the clutches of greed\nand avarice and keeps aloof from undesirable hankering after the world, he too gets (pleasures\nof) the world and he does not remain deprived of it.\nTherefore, he who surveys this world from above its surface and takes lesson from its chances\nand happenings, and through its variation, and alterations gains knowledge about Allah's\nMight, Wisdom and Sagacity, Mercy, Clemency and Sustaining power, his eyes will gain real\nbrightness and sight. On the other hand the person who is lost only in the colourfulness of the\nworld and its decorations, he loses himself in the darkness of the world that is why Allah has\nforbidden to view the world thus:\nAnd strain not thine eyes unto that which We have provided (different) parties of\nthem, (of) the splendour of the life of this world, so that We may try them in it;\nfor the provision of thy Lord is better and more abiding.
