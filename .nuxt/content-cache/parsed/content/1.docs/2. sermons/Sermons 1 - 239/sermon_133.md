He knows all that breasts\ncontain or eyes hide.\nWe render evidence that there is no god except He and that Muhammad - peace be upon him\nand his progeny - has been chosen by Him and deputised by Him -evidence tendered both\nsecretly and openly, by heart and by tongue.\nA part of the same sermon\nBy Allah, certainly it is reality not fun, truth not falsehood. It is none else than death. Its caller\nis making himself heard and its dragsman is making haste. The majority of the people should\nnot deceive you. You have seen those who lived before you, amassed wealth, feared poverty\nand felt safe from its (evil) consequences, the longevity of desires and the (apparent) distance\nfrom death.\nHow, then, death overtook them, turned them out of their homelands and took them out of\ntheir places of safety.\nThey were borne on coffins, people were busy about them one after another, carrying them on\ntheir shoulders and supporting them with their hands.\nDid you not witness those who engaged in long-reaching desires, built strong buildings,\namassed much wealth but their houses turned to graves and their collections turned into ruin.\nTheir property devolved on the successors and their spouses on those who came after them.\nThey cannot (now) add to their good acts nor invoke (Allah's) mercy in respect of evil acts.\nTherefore, whoever makes his heart habituated to fear Allah achieves a forward position and\nhis action is successful. Prepare yourself for it and do all that you can for Paradise.\nCertainly this world has not been made a place of permanent stay for you. But it has been\ncreated as a pathway in order that you may take from it the provisions of your (good) actions\nfor the permanent house (in Paradise). Be ready for departure from here and keep close your\nriding animals for setting off."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_133.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_133.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"Gkbhzwiywm"}
