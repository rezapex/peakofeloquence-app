Do not make haste for a matter which is to happen and is awaited, and do not\nwish for delay in what the morrow is to bring for you. For, how many people make haste for a\nmatter, but when they get it they begin to wish they had not got it.\nHow near is today to the dawning of tomorrow. O' my people, this is the time for the\noccurrence of every promised event and the approach of things which you do not know.\nWhoever from among us will be during these days will move through them with a burning\nlamp and will tread on the footsteps of the virtuous, in order to unfasten knots, to free slaves,\nto divide the united and to unite the divided.\nHe will be in concealment from people. The stalker will not find his footprints even though he\npursues with his eye.\nThen a group of people will be sharpened like the sharpening of swords by the blacksmith.\nTheir sight will be brightened by revelation, the (delicacies of) commentary will be put in\ntheir ears and they will be given drinks of wisdom, morning and evening.\nA part of the same sermon\nTheir period became long in order that they might complete (their position of) disgrace and\ndeserve vicissitudes, till the end of the period was reached, and a group of people turned\ntowards mischief and picked up their arms for fighting.\nThe virtuous did not show any obligation to Allah but calmly endured, and did not feel elated\nfor having engaged themselves in truthfulness. Eventually the period of trial came to an end\naccording to what was ordained. Then they propagated their good views among others and\nsought nearness to Allah according to the command of their leader.\nWhen Allah took the Prophet (to himself) a group of men went back on their tracks. The ways\n(of misguidance) ruined them and they placed trust in deceitful intriguers, showed\nconsideration to other than kinsmen, abandoned the kin whom they had been ordered to love,\nand shifted the building from its strong foundation and built it in other than its (proper) place.\nThey are the source of every shortcoming and the door of gropers in the dark. They were\nmoving to and fro in amazement and lay intoxicated in the way of the people of the Pharaohs.\nThey were either bent on this world and taking support on it or away from the faith and\nremoved from it."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_151.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_151.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"HW2ZM3FzXA"}
