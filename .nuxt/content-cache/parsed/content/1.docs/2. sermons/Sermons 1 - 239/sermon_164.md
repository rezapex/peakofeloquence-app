He makes streams to flow and\nvegetation to grow on high lands. His primality has no beginning, nor has His eternity any\nend. He is the First and from ever. He is the everlasting without limit.\nForeheads bow before Him and lips declare His oneness. He determined the limits of things at\nthe time of His creating them, keeping Himself away from any likeness.\nImagination cannot surmise Him within the limits of movements limbs or senses. It cannot be\nsaid about Him: \"whence\"; and no time limit can be attributed to Him by saying \"till\". He is\napparent, but it cannot be said \"from what\".\nHe is hidden, but it cannot be said \"in what\". He is not a body which can die, nor is He veiled\nso as to be enclosed therein. He is not near to things by way of touch, nor is He remote from\nthem by way of separation.\nThe gazing of people's eyes is not hidden from Him, nor the repetition of words, nor the\nglimpse of hillocks, nor the tread of a footstep in the dark night or in the deep gloom, where\nthe shining moon casts its light and the effulgent sun comes in its wake, through its setting\nand appearing again and again with the rotation of time and periods, by the approach of the\nadvancing night or the passing away of the running day.\nHe precedes every extremity and limit, and every counting and numbering. He is far above\nwhat those whose regard is limited attribute to Him, such as the qualities of measure, having\nextremities, living in house and dwelling in abodes, because limits are meant for creation and\nare attributable only to other than Allah.\nAllah, the Originator from naught\nHe did not create things from eternal matter nor after ever-existing examples, but He created\nwhatever He created and then He fixed limits thereto, and He shaped whatever He shaped and\ngave the best shape thereto. Nothing can disobey Him, but the obedience of something is of\nno benefit to Him.\nHis knowledge about those who died in the past is the same as His knowledge about the\nremaining survivors, and His knowledge about whatever there is in the high skies is like His\nknowledge of whatever there is in the low earth.\nA part of the same sermon\nAbout man's creation, and pointing towards the requirements of life.\nO' creature who has been equitably created and who has been nurtured and looked after in the\ndarkness of wombs with multiple curtains.\nYou were originated from the essence of clay (Qur'an, 23:12) and placed in a still place for a\nknown length (Qur'an, 77:21-22) and an ordained time. You used to move in the womb of\nyour mother as an embryo, neither responding to a call nor hearing any voice.\nThen you were taken out from your place of stay to a place you had not seen, and you were\nnot acquainted with the means of awaiting its benefits, or with who guided you to eke out\nyour sustenance from the udder of your mother, and, when your were in need, appraised you\nof the location of what you required or aimed at.\nAlas! Certainly he who is unable to understand the qualities of a being with shape and limbs\nis the more unable to understand the qualities of the Creator and the more remote from\nappreciating Him through the limitations of creatures."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_164.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_164.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"HceVHNUIi9"}
