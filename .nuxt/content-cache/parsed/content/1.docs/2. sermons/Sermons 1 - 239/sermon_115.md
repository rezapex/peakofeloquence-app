The scale wherein they would\nbe placed would not be light while the scale from which they are removed would not become\nheavy.\nEnjoining people to Piety\nO' creatures of Allah! I advise you to have fear of Allah which is the provision (for the next\nworld) and with it is (your) return. The provision would take you (to your destination) and the\nreturn would be successful. The best one, who is able to make people listen has called\ntowards it and the best listener has listened to it. So the caller has proclaimed and the listener\nhas listened and preserved.\nO' creations of Allah! certainly fear of Allah has saved the lovers of Allah from unlawful\nitems and gave His dread to their hearts till their nights are passed in wakefulness and their\nnoons in thirst. So they achieve comfort through trouble and copious watering through thirst.\nThey regarded death to be near and therefore hastened towards (good) actions. They rejected\ntheir desires and so they kept death in their sight.\nThen, this world is a place of destruction, tribulations, changes and lessons. As for\ndestruction, the time has its bow pressed (to readiness) and its dart does not go amiss, its\nwound does not heal; it afflicts the living with death, the healthy with ailment and the safe\nwith distress.\nIt is an eater who is not satisfied and a drinker whose thirst is never quenched. As for\ntribulation, a man collects what he does not eat and builds wherein he does not live. Then he\ngoes out to Allah without carrying the wealth or shifting the building.\nAs for its changes, you see a pitiable man becoming enviable and an enviable man becoming\npitiable. This is because the wealth has gone and misfortune has come to him.\nAs for its lessons, a man reaches near (realisation of) his desires when (suddenly) the\napproach of his death cuts them; then neither the desire is achieved nor the desirer spared.\nGlory to Allah, how deceitful are its pleasures, how thirst-rousing its quenching and how\nsunny its shade.\nThat which approaches (i.e. death) cannot be sent back, he who goes away does not return.\nGlory to Allah, how near is the living to the dead because he will meet him soon and how far\nis the dead from the living because he has gone away from him.\nCertainly nothing is viler than evil except its punishment, and nothing is better than good\nexcept its reward. In this world everything that is heard is better than what is seen, while of\neverything of the next world that is seen is better than what is heard.\nSo you should satisfy yourself by hearing rather than seeing and by the news of the unknown.\nYou should know that what is little in this world but much in the next is better than what is\nmuch in this world but little in the next. In how many cases little is profitable while much\ncauses loss.\nCertainly that which you have been commanded to do is wider than what you have been\nrefrained from, and what has been made lawful for you is more than what has been\nprohibited. Then give up what is less for what is much, and what is limited for what is vast.\nAllah has guaranteed your livelihood and has commanded you to act. Therefore, the pursuit of\nthat which has been guaranteed to you should not get preference over that whose performance\nhas been enjoined upon you.\nBut by Allah, most certainly the position is that doubt has overtaken and certainty has been\nshattered and it seems as if what has been guaranteed to you is obligatory on you and what\nwas made obligatory on you has been taken away from you. So, hasten towards (good)\nactions and dread the suddenness of death, because the return of age cannot be hoped for, as\nthe return of livelihood can be hoped for.\nWhatever is missed from livelihood today may be hoped tomorrow with increase, but\nwhatever is lost from the age yesterday, its return cannot be expected today.\nHope can be only for that which is to come, while about that which is passed there is only\ndisappointment. So \"fear Allah as He ought to be feared and do not die until you are (true)\nMuslim.\" (Qur'an , 3:102)"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_115.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_115.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"NJEea0bfoR"}
