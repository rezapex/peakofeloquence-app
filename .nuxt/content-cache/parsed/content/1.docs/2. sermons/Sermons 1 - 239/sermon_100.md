I advise you to keep away from this world which is (shortly) to leave\nyou even though you do not like its departure, and which would make your bodies old even\nthough you would like to keep them fresh.\nYour example and its example is like the travellers who travel some distance and then as\nthough they traverse it quickly or they aimed at a sign and reached it at once. How short is the\ndistance to the aim if one heads towards it and reaches it.\nAnd how short is the stage of one who has only a day which he cannot exceed while a swift\ndriver is driving him in this world till he departs from it.\nSo do not hanker after worldly honour and its pride, and do not feel happy over its beauties\nand bounties nor wail over its damages and misfortunate because its honour and pride would\nend while its beauty and bounty would perish, and its damages and misfortunes would pass\naway. Every period in it has an end and every living being in it is to die.\nIs not there for you a warning in the relics of the predecessors and an eye opener and lesson in\nyour fore-fathers, provided you understand?\nDo you not see that your predecessors do not come back and the surviving followers do not\nremain? Do you not observe that the people of the world pass mornings and evenings in\ndifferent conditions? Thus, (somewhere) the dead is wept for, someone is being condoled,\nsomeone is prostrate in distress, someone is enquiring about the sick, someone is passing his\nlast breath, someone is hankering after the world while death is looking for him, someone is\nforgetful but he is not forgotten (by death), and on the footsteps of the predecessors walk the\nsurvivors.\nBeware! At the time of committing evil deeds remember the destroyer of joys, the spoiler of\npleasures, and the killer of desires (namely death). Seek assistance of Allah for fulfilment of\nHis obligatory rights, and for (thanking Him) for His countless bounties and obligations."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_100.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_100.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"vg4jF5soyH"}
