Have you not heard the reply of the people of Hell when they were\nasked: What hath brought you into the hell? They shall say: We were not of those who offered\nthe regular prayers (to Allah)! (Qur'an, 74:42-43). Certainly, prayer drops out sins like the\ndropping of leaves (of trees), and removes them as ropes are removed from the necks of cattle.\nThe Messenger of Allah - the peace and blessing of Allah he upon him and his descendants -\nlikened it to a hot bath situated at the door of a person who bathes in it five times a day. Will\nthen any dirt remain on him?\nIts obligation is recognised by those believers whom neither the adornment of property nor\nthe coolness of the eyes produced by children can turn away from it. Allah, the Glorified,\nsays:\nMen whom neither merchandise nor any sale diverteth from the remembrance\nof Allah and constancy in prayer and paying the poor-rate; ... (Qur'an. 24:37)\nEven after receiving assurance of Paradise, the Messenger of Allah - peace and blessing of\nAllah be upon him and his descendants - used to exert himself for prayers because of Allah,\nthe Glorified's command.\nAnd enjoin prayer on thy followers, and adhere thou steadily unto it, ... (Qur'an,\n20:132).\nThen the Holy Prophet used to enjoin his followers to prayer and exert himself for it.\nAbout the Islamic Tax (zakat)\nThen, Islamic tax has been laid down along with prayer as a sacrifice (to be offered) by the\npeople of Islam. Whoever pays it by way of purifying his spirit, it serves as a purifier for him\nand a protection and shield against fire (of Hell). No one therefore (who pays it) should feel\nattached to it afterwards, nor should feel grieved over it.\nWhoever pays it without the intention of purifying his heart expects through it more than its\ndue. He is certainly ignorant of the sunnah, he is allowed no reward for it, his action goes to\nwaste and his repentance is excessive.\nFulfilment of Trust\nThen, as regards fulfilment of trust, whoever does not pay attention to it will be disappointed.\nIt was placed before the strong skies, vast earths and high mountains but none of them was\nfound to be stronger. vaster, or higher than it.\nIf anything could be unapproachable because of height, vastness, power or strength they\nwould have been unapproachable, but they felt afraid of the evil consequences (of failure in\nfulfilling a trust) and noticed what a weaker being did not realise it, and this was man.\n. . . Verily he was (proved) unjust, ignorant. (Qur'an, 33:72)\nSurely, Allah, the Glorified, the Sublime, nothing is hidden from Him of whatever people do\nin their nights or days. He knows all the details, and His knowledge covers them. Your limbs\nare a witness, the organs of your body constitute an army (against yourself), your inner self\nserves Him as eyes (to watch your sins), and your loneliness is open to Him."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_200.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_200.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"zFL95UZLQK"}
