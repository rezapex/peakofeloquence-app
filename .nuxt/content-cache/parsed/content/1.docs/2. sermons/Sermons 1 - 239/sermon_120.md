Then he said: \"What is the matter with you. Have you become dumb?\" A group of\nthem replied: \"O' Amir al-mu'minin if you go forth we shall be with you.\" Whereupon Amir\nal-mu'minin said:\nWhat has happened to you? You may not be guided aright or shown the right path. Should in\nthese circumstances I go forth? In fact, at this time one of the brave and the valorous among\nyou whom I select should go out. It does not suit me to leave the army, the city, the public\ntreasury, the land revenue, the dispensation of justice among Muslims and looking after the\ndemands of the claimants and to follow one contingent after the other moving here and there\nlike a featherless arrow moving in the quiver.\nI am the axis of the mill. It rotates on me while I remain in my position. As soon as I leave it\nthe centre of its rotation would be disturbed and its lower stone would also be disturbed.\nBy Allah, this is a very bad advice. By Allah, if I had not been hoping for martyrdom by my\nmeeting with the enemy - and my meeting with him has been ordained, I would have secured\nmy carrier and went away from you and would not have sought you so long as North and\nSouth differed.\nThere is no benefit in the majority of your numbers because of lack of unity of your hearts. I\nhave put you on the clear path whereon no one will perish except who perishes by himself. He\nwho sticks to it would achieve Paradise and he who deviates goes to Hell.\n(1). When after the Battle of Siffin, Mu'awiyah's forces began to attack various places in Amir\nal-mu'minin's area, he asked the Iraqis to check them but they declined on the plea that they\nwould follow him if he himself came forward. Thereupon he delivered this sermon, and clarified\nhis limitations, that if he himself went out it was impossible to run the affairs of the state, and\nthat the enemy's attacks had already started on all sides.\nIn these circumstances it was impolitic to keep the centre unguarded. But what could be hoped\nfrom those who changed the victory at Siffin into defeat and opened the door for these\nattacks."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_120.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_120.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"M1OTCAfZXW"}
