Fear Allah and anticipate your death by good actions. Purchase\neverlasting joy by paying transitory things - pleasures of this world.\nGet ready for the journey, for you are being driven, and prepare yourselves for death, since it\nis hovering over you. Be a people who wake up when called, and who know that this world is\nnot their abode, and so have it changed (with the next).\nCertainly, Allah has not created you aimlessly nor left you as useless. There is nothing\nbetween anyone of you and Paradise or Hell except death that must befall him.\nThe life that is being shortened every moment and being dismantled every hour must be\nregarded very short. The hidden thing namely death which is being driven (to you) by two\nover new phenomena, the day and the night, is certainly quick of approach.\nThe traveller which is approaching with success or failure (namely death) deserves the best of\nprovision. So acquire such provision from this world while you are here with which you may\nshield yourself tomorrow (on the Day of Judgement).\nSo everyone should fear Allah, should admonish himself, should send forward his repentance\nand should overpower his desire, because his death is hidden from him, his desires deceive\nhim and Satan is posted on him and he beautifies for him sin so that he may commit it and\nprompts him to delay repentance till his desires make him the most negligent.\nPiety is for the negligent person whose life itself would be a proof against him and his own\ndays (passed in sin) would lead him to punishment.\nWe ask Allah, the Glorified, that He may make us and you like one whom bounty does not\nmislead, whom nothing can stop from obedience of Allah and whom shame and grief do not\nbefall after death."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_65.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_65.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"B5AZ01K6cW"}
