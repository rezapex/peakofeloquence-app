He encompasses everything. He\nhas control over everything and power over everything. Everyone of you should do whatever\nhe has to do during his days of life before the approach of death, in his leisure before his\noccupation, and during the breathing of his breath before it is overtaken by suffocation,\nshould provide for himself and his journey and should collect provision from his place of halt\nfor his place of stay.\nSo remember Allah, O' people, about what He has asked you in His Book to take care of, and\nabout His rights that He has entrusted to you. Verily, Allah has not created you in vain nor\nleft you unbridled nor left you alone in ignorance and gloom. He has defined what you should\nleave behind.\ntaught you your acts, ordained your death, sent down to you. \"the Book (Qur'an) explaining\neverything\" (Qur'an, 16:89) and made His Prophet live among you for a long time till He\ncompleted for him and for you the message sent through the Qur'an namely the religion liked\nby Him, and clarified through him His good acts and evil acts, His prohibitions and His\ncommands.\nHe placed before you His arguments and exhausted his excuses upon you. He put forth to you\nHis promises and warned you of severe retribution. You should therefore make full atonement\nduring your remaining days and let yourselves practice endurance in these days.\nThese days are fewer as against the many days during which you have shown obliviousness\nand heedlessness towards admonition. Do not allow time to yourselves because it will put you\non the path of wrong-doers and do not be easy-going because this will push you towards\nsinfulness.\nO' creatures of Allah! the best adviser for himself is he who is the most obedient to Allah, and\nthe most deceiving for himself is he who is the most disobedient to Allah. Deceived is he who\ndeceived his own self. Enviable is he whose Faith is safe.\nFortunate is he who takes lesson from others, while unfortunate is he who fell victim to his\ndesires. You should know that even the smallest hypocrisy is like believing in more than one\nGod, and keeping company of people who follow their desires is the key to obliviousness\nfrom religion, and is the seat of Satan.\nBe on your guard against falsehood because it is contrary to Faith. A truthful person is on the\nheight of salvation and dignity, while the liar is on the edge of ignominy and degradation. Do\nnot be jealous because jealousy eats away Faith just as fire eats away dried wood. Do not bear\nmalice because, it is a scraper (of virtues).\nAnd know that desires make wit forgetful and make memory oblivious. You should falsify\ndesire because it is a deception, and he who has desires is in deceit."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_87.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_87.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"7aIxW7Qcws"}
