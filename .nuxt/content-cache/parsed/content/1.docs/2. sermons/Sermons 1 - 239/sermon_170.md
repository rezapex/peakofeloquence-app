No one will be ruined by it except one who ruins himself. Certainly, only\ndoubtful innovations cause ruin except those from which Allah may protect.\nIn Allah's authority lies the safety of your affairs. Therefore, render Him such obedience as is\nneither blameworthy nor insincere. By Allah, you must do so, otherwise Allah will take away\nfrom you the power of Islam, and will never thereafter return it to you till it reverts to others.\nCertainly, these people are in agreement in disliking my authority. I will carry on till I\nperceive disunity among you; because if, in spite of the unsoundness of their view, they\nsucceed, the whole organisation of the Muslims will be shattered. They are hankering after\nthis world out of jealousy against him on whom Allah has bestowed it.\nSo they intend reverting the matters on their backs (pre-Islamic period), while on us it is\nobligatory, for your sake, to abide by the Book of Allah (Qur'an), the Sublime, and the\nconduct of the Prophet of Allah, to stand by His rights and the revival of his sunnah."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_170.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_170.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"6MhbAV6Sft"}
