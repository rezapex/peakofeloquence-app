Every man with a heart is not intelligent, every\near does not listen and every eye does not see.\nI wonder, and there is no reason why I should not wonder, about the faults of these groups\nwho have introduced alterations in their religious pleas, who do not move on the footsteps of\ntheir Prophet nor follow the actions of the vicegerent. They do not believe in the unknown\nand do not avoid the evil. They act on the doubts and tread in (the way of) their passions.\nFor them good is whatever they consider good and evil is whatever they consider evil. Their\nreliance for resolving distresses is on themselves.\nTheir confidence in regard to dubious matters is on their own opinions as if every one of them\nis the Leader (Imam) of himself. Whatever he has decided himself he considers it to have\nbeen taken through reliable sources and strong factors."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_89.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_89.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"Em4Z1eB3sp"}
