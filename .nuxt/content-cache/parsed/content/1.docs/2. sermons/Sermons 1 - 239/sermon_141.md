Gratefulness should be mostly their indulgence and it\nshould prevent them from (finding faults with) others.\nWhat about the backbiter who blames his brother and finds fault with him? Does he not\nremember that Allah has concealed the sins which he committed while they were bigger than\nhis brother's sins pointed out by him? How can he vilify him about his sins when he has\nhimself committed one like it? Even if he has not committed a similar sin he must have\ncommitted bigger ones.\nBy Allah, even if he did not commit big sins but committed only small sins, his exposing the\nsins of people is itself a big sin.\nO' creature of Allah, do not be quick in exposition anyone's sin for he may be forgiven for it,\nand do not feel yourself safe even for a small sin because you may be punished for it.\nTherefore, every one of you who comes to know the faults of others should not expose them\nin view of what he knows about his own faults, and he should remain busy in thanks that he\nhas been saved from what others have been indulging in.\n(1). The habit of fault finding and backbiting has become so common that even the feeling of\nits evilness has disappeared. And at present neither the high avoid it nor the low; neither the\nhigh position of the pulpit prevents it nor the sacredness of the mosque. Whenever a few\ncompanions sit together their topic of conversation and engaging interest is just to discuss the\nfaults of their opponents with added colourisation, and to listen to them attentively.\nAlthough the fault finder is himself involved in the faults which he picks up in others, yet he\ndoes not like that his own faults should be exposed. In such a case, he should have\nconsideration for similar feelings in others and should avoid searching for their faults and\nhurting their feelings. He should act after the proverb: \"Do not do unto others what you do not\nwant others to do unto you.\"\nBackbiting is defined as the exposure of the fault of a brother-in-faith with the intent to vilify\nhim in such a way as to irritate him, whether it be by speaking, acting, implication or\nsuggestion. Some people take backbiting to cover only that which is false or contrary to fact.\nAccording to them to relate what was seen or heard, exactly as it was, is not backbiting, and\nthey say that they are not backbiting but only relating exactly what they saw or heard. But in\nfact backbiting is the name of this very relating of the facts, because if it is not factually correct\nit would be false accusation and wrong blame.\nIt is related about the Prophet that he said:\n\"Do you know what backbiting is?\" People said, \"Allah and His Prophet know\nbetter.\" Then he said, \"Backbiting means that you say about your brother a\nthing which pains him.\" Someone said, \"But what if I say what is actually true\nabout him?\" The Prophet replied, \"It is backbiting only when it is factually true,\notherwise you would be accusing him falsely.\"\nThere are many causes for indulging in backbiting, and because of this a man commits it\nsometimes knowingly and sometimes unknowingly. Abu Hamid al-Ghazali has recounted these\ncauses in detail in his book Ihya' `ulumu'd-din. A few of the important ones are:\n1)\nTo make fun of anyone or to make him appear abased.\n2)\nTo make people laugh and to display one's own jolliness and high spiritedness.\n3)\nExpressing one's feelings under the influence of rage and anger.\n4)\nTo establish one's feelings under the influence of rage and anger.\n5)\nTo disprove one's connection or involvement in a matter; namely that a particular evil\nwas not committed by oneself but by someone else.\n6)\nTo associate oneself with some group when in their company in order to avoid\nstrangeness with them.\n7)\nTo belittle a person from whom it is feared that he will expose some fault of one's.\n8)\nTo defeat a competitor in the same calling.\n9)\nTo seek position in the audience of someone in power.\n10)\nTo express sorrow by saying it is sad that so-and-so has fallen in such and such a sin.\n11)\nTo express astonishment, for example, to say it is wonderful that so and so has done\nthis.\n12)\nTo name the committer of an act when expressing anger over it.\nHowever, in some cases fault finding or criticising does not fall under backbiting.\n1)\nIf the oppressed complains of the oppressor in order to seek redress, it is not\nbackbiting. Allah says about it:\nLoveth not Allah open utterance of evil in speech except by one who hath been\nwronged.. (Qur'an, 4:148)\n2)\nTo relate anyone's fault while giving advice is no backbiting because dishonesty and\nduplicity is not permissible in counselling.\n3)\nIf in connection with seeking the requirements of a religious commandment the\nnaming of a particular individual cannot be avoided, then to state the fault of such\nperson to the extent necessary would not be backbiting.\n4)\nTo relate the misappropriation or dishonesty committed by someone with a view to\nsaving a Muslim brother from harm would not be backbiting.\n5)\nTo relate the fault of someone before one who can prevent him from committing it is\nnot backbiting.\n6)\nCriticism and expression of opinion about a relater of traditions is not backbiting.\n7)\nIf a person is well acquainted with someone's shortcoming, then to relate such a\nfault in order to define his personality, for example, describing a deaf, dumb, lame or\nhandless person as thus, is not backbiting.\n8)\nTo describe any fault of a patient before a physician for purposes of treatment is not\nbackbiting.\n9)\nIf someone claims wrong lineage then to expose his correct lineage is not backbiting.\n10)\nIf the life, property or honour of someone can be protected only by informing him of\nsome fault, it would not be backbiting.\n11)\nIf two persons discuss a fault of another which is already known to both it would not\nbe backbiting, although to avoid discussing it is better, since it is possible one of the\ntwo might have forgotten it.\n12)\nTo expose the evils of one who openly commits evils is not back-biting as the\ntradition runs:\n\"There is no backbiting in the case of he who has torn away the veil of\nshamefulness.\""}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_141.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_141.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"MA1R6Ax8tA"}
