By Allah the son of Abu Quhafah (Abu Bakr)(2) dressed himself with it (the\ncaliphate) and he certainly knew that my position in relation to it was the same as the position\nof the axis in relation to the hand-mill. The flood water flows down from me and the bird\ncannot fly upto me. I put a curtain against the caliphate and kept myself detached from it.\nThen I began to think whether I should assault or endure calmly the blinding darkness of\ntribulations wherein the grown up are made feeble and the young grow old and the true\nbeliever acts under strain till he meets Allah (on his death). I found that endurance thereon\nwas wiser.\nSo I adopted patience although there was pricking in the eye and suffocation (of\nmortification) in the throat. I watched the plundering of my inheritance till the first one went\nhis way but handed over the Caliphate to Ibn al-Khattab after himself.\n(Then he quoted al-A"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"sha's verse). My days are now passed on the camel's back (in difficulty) while there were days (of ease) when I enjoyed the company of Jabir's brother Hayyan.(3) It is strange that during his lifetime he wished to be released from the caliphate but he confirmed it for the other one after his death. No doubt these two shared its udders strictly among themselves. This one put the Caliphate in a tough enclosure where the utterance was haughty and the touch was rough. Mistakes were in plenty and so also the excuses therefore. One in contact with it was like the rider of an unruly camel. If he pulled up its rein the very nostril would be slit, but if he let it loose he would be thrown. Consequently, by Allah people got involved in recklessness, wickedness, unsteadiness and deviation. Nevertheless, I remained patient despite length of period and stiffness of trial, till when he went his way (of death) he put the matter (of Caliphate) in a group(4) and regarded me to be one of them. But good Heavens! what had I to do with this \"consultation\"? Where was any doubt about me with regard to the first of them that I was now considered akin to these ones? But I remained low when they were low and flew high when they flew high. One of them turned against me because of his hatred and the other got inclined the other way due to his in-law relationship and this thing and that thing, till the third man of these people stood up with heaving breasts between his dung and fodder. With him his children of his grand-father, (Umayyah) also stood up swallowing up Allah's wealth(5) like a camel devouring the foliage of spring, till his rope broke down, his actions finished him and his gluttony brought him down prostrate. At that moment, nothing took me by surprise, but the crowd of people rushing to me. It advanced towards me from every side like the mane of the hyena so much so that Hasan and Husayn were getting crushed and both the ends of my shoulder garment were torn. They collected around me like the herd of sheep and goats. When I took up the reins of government one party broke away and another turned disobedient while the rest began acting wrongfully as if they had not heard the word of Allah saying: That abode in the hereafter, We assign it for those who intend not to exult themselves in the earth, nor (to make) mischief (therein); and the end is (best) for the pious ones. (Qur'an, 28:83) Yes, by Allah, they had heard it and understood it but the world appeared glittering in their eyes and its embellishments seduced them. Behold, by Him who split the grain (to grow) and created living beings, if people had not come to me and supporters had not exhausted the argument and if there had been no pledge of Allah with the learned to the effect that they should not acquiesce in the gluttony of the oppressor and the hunger of the oppressed I would have cast the rope of Caliphate on its own shoulders, and would have given the last one the same treatment as to the first one. Then you would have seen that in my view this world of yours is no better than the sneezing of a goat.

In the same sense the word \"shanaqa an-naqah\"\nis used. Ibn as-Sikkit has mentioned this in Islah al-mantiq. Amir al-mu'minin has said\n\"ashnaqa laha\" instead of \"ashnaqaha\", this is because he has used this word in harmony with\n\"aslasa laha\" and harmony could be retained only by using both in the same form.\nThus, Amir al-mu'minin has used \"ashnaqa laha\" as though in place of \"in rafa"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"a laha ra'saha\", that is, \"if he stops it by holding up the reins.\" (1). This sermon is known as the sermon of ash-Shiqshiqiyyah, and is counted among the most famous sermons of Amir al-mu'minin. It was delivered at ar-Rahbah. Although some people have denied it to be Amir al-mu'minin's utterance and by attributing it to as-Sayyid ar- Radi (or ash-Sharif ar-Radi) have laid blame on his acknowledged integrity, yet truth-loving scholars have denied its veracity.

If the memory of discouraging circumstances faced by him soon\nafter the death of the Prophet appeared unpalatable to him it should not be surprising.\nNo doubt this sermon hits at the prestige of certain personalities and gives a set back to the\nfaith and belief in them but this cannot be sustained by denying the sermon to be Amir almu'minin's\nutterance, unless the true events are analysed and truth unveiled; otherwise just\ndenying it to be Amir al-mu'minin's utterance because it contains disparagement of certain\nindividuals carries no weight, when similar criticism has been related by other historians as\nwell.

If it is held he could not attend to it and appreciate its need or absence of need it would be the biggest proof for regarding the Prophet's mind to be blank for thinking of means to stop the evils of innovations and apostasy in spite of having given warnings about them. If it is said that he did realise it but had to live it unresolved on account of some advantage then instead of keeping it hidden the advantage should be clearly indicated otherwise silence without purpose would constitute delinquency in the discharge of the obligations of Prophethood. If there was some impediment, it should be disclosed otherwise we should agree that just as the Prophet did not leave any item of religion incomplete he did not leave this matter either and did propose such a course of action for it, that if it was acted upon religion would have remained safe against the interference of others. The question now is what was that course of action. If it is taken to be the consensus of opinion of the community then it cannot truly take place as in such consensus acquiescence of every individual is necessary; but taking into account the difference in human temperaments it seems impossible that they would agree on any single point. Nor is there any example where on such matters there has been no single voice of dissent. How then can such a fundamental need be made dependent on the occurrence of such an impossible event - need on which converges the future of Islam and the good of the Muslims. Therefore, the mind is not prepared to accept this criterion. Nor is tradition in harmony with it, as al-Qadi "}]},{"type":"text","value":"Adud ad-Dinal-'Iji has written in Sharh al-mawaqif:\nYou should know that Caliphate cannot depend upon unanimity of election\nbecause no logical or traditional argument can be advanced for it.\nIn fact when the advocates of unanimous election found that unanimity of all votes is difficult\nthey adopted the agreement of the majority as a substitute for unanimity, ignoring the\ndifference of the minority. In such a case also it often happens that the force of fair and foul or\ncorrect and incorrect ways turns the flow of the majority opinion in the direction where there is\nneither individual distinction nor personal merit as a result of which competent persons remain\nhidden while incompetent individuals stand forward. When capabilities remain so curbed and\npersonal ends stand in the way as hurdles, how can there be expectation for the election of\ncorrect person.\nEven if it is assumed that all voters have an independent unbiased view, that none of them has\nhis own objective and that none has any other consideration, it is not necessary that every\nverdict of the majority should be correct, and that it cannot go astray. Experience shows that\nafter experiment the majority has held its own verdict to be wrong.\nIf every verdict of the majority is correct then its first verdict should be wrong because the\nverdict which holds it wrong is also that of the majority. In this circumstances if the election of\nthe Caliph goes wrong who would be responsible for the mistake, and who should face the\nblame for the ruination of the Islamic polity. Similarly on whom would be the liability for the\nbloodshed and slaughter following the turmoil and activity of the elections. When it has been\nseen that even those who sat in the audience of the Holy Prophet could not be free of mutual\nquarrel and strife how can others avoid it.\nIf with a view to avoid mischief it is left to the people of authority to choose anyone they like\nthen here too the same friction and conflict would prevail because here again convergence of\nhuman temperaments on one point is not necessary nor can they be assumed to rise above\npersonal ends. In fact here the chances of conflict and collision would be stronger because if\nnot all at least most of them would themselves be candidates for that position and would not\nspare any effort to defeat their opponent, creating impediments in his way as best as possible.\nIts inevitable consequence would be mutual struggle and mischief-mongering.\nThus, it would not be possible to ward off the mischief for which this device was adopted, and\ninstead of finding a proper individual the community would just become an instrument for the\nachievement of personal benefits of the others. Again, what would be the criterion for these\npeople in authority? The same as has usually been, namely whoever collects a few supporters\nand is able to create commotion in any meeting by use of forceful words would count among\nthe people of authority.\nOr would capabilities also be judged? If the mode of judging the capabilities is again this very\ncommon vote then the same complications and conflicts would arise here too, to avoid which\nthis way was adopted.\nIf there is some other standard, then instead of judging the capabilities of the voters by it why\nnot judge the person who is considered suitable for the position in view. Further, how many\npersons in authority would be enough to give a verdict? Apparently a verdict once accepted\nwould be precedent for good and the number that would give this verdict would become the\ncriterion for future. al-Qadi "},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Adud ad-Din al-'Iji writes: Rather the nomination of one or two individuals by the people in authority is enough because we know that the companions who were strict in religion deemed it enough as the nomination of Abu Bakr by "}]},{"type":"text","value":"Umar and of "},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Uthman by "}]},{"type":"text","value":"Abd ar-Rahman.
