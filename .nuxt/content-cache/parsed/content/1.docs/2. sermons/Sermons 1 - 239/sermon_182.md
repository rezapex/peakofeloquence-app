Know that when the\nspears are hurled towards them and the swords are struck at their heads they will repent of\ntheir doings.\nSurely today Satan has scattered them and tomorrow he will disclaim any connection with\nthem, and will leave them. Their departing from guidance, returning to misguidance and\nblindness, turning away from truth and falling into wrong is enough (for their chastisement).\n(1). A man of the tribe Banu Najiyah named al-Khirrit ibn Rashid an-Naji was on Amir almu'minin's\nside in the battle of Siffin, but after Arbitration he became rebellious, and, coming\nto Amir al-mu'minin with thirty persons, said: \"By Allah, I Will no more obey your command,\nnor offer prayers behind you, and shall leave you tomorrow.\" Whereupon Amir al-mu'minin\nsaid: \"You should first take into account the grounds underlying this Arbitration and discuss it\nwith me.\nIf you are satisfied, you do as you will.\" He said he would come the next day to discuss the\nmatter. Amir al-mu'minin then cautioned him, \"Look, on going from here do not get mislead by\nothers and do not adopt any other course. If you have the will to understand, I will get you out\nof this wrong path and put you on the course of guidance.\" After this conversation he went\naway, but his countenance indicated he was bent on revolt, and would not see reason by any\nmeans.\nAnd so it happened. He stuck to his point and on reaching his place he said to his tribesmen,\n\"When we are determined to abandon Amir al-mu'minin there is no use going to him.
