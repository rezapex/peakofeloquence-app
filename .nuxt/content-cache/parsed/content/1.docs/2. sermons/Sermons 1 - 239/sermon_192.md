I praise Him for His successive favours and His great gifts. His forbearance\nis high so that He forgives and is just in whatever He decides.\nHe knows what is going on and what has already passed. He crafted all creation by His\nknowledge and produced it by His intelligence without limitation, without learning, without\nfollowing the example of any intelligent producer, without committing any mistake and\nwithout the availability of any group (for help); I stand witness that Muhammad - the peace\nand blessing of Allah be upon him and his descendants - is His slave and His messenger\nwhom He deputed (at a time) when people were collecting in the abyss and moving in\nbewilderment.\nThe reins of destruction were dragging them, and the locks of malice lay fixed on their hearts.\nAdvice about fear of Allah and an account of this world and its people\nI advise you, O' creature of Allah, that you should have fear of Allah because it is a right of\nAllah over you and it creates your right over Allah, and that you should seek Allah's help in it,\nand its help in (meeting) Allah. Certainly, for today fear of Allah is a protection and a shield,\nand for tomorrow (the Day of Judgement) it is the road to Paradise. Its way is clear and he\nwho treads it is the gainer. Whoever holds it, guards it.\nIt has presented itself to the people who have already passed and to those coming from\nbehind, because they will need it tomorrow (on the Day of Judgement) when Allah will revive\nHis creation again, take back what He has given and take account of what He has bestowed.\nHow few will be those who accept it and practise it as it ought to be practised. They will be\nvery few in number, and they are the people who correspond to the description given by\nAllah, the Glorified, when He says:\n... And very few of My creatures are grateful! (Qur'an. 34:13)\nTherefore, hasten with your ears towards it and intensify your efforts for it. Make it a\nsubstitute for all your past (short-comings) to take their place as a successor, and make it your\nsupporter against every opponent. Turn your sleep into wakefulness by its help, and pass your\ndays with it. Make it the equipment of your hearts, wash your sins with it, treat your ailments\nwith it and hasten towards your death with it.\nTake a lesson from him who neglects it, so that others who follow it should not take a lesson\nfrom you (i.e., from your neglecting it). Beware, therefore; you should take care of it and\nshould take care of yourselves through it.\nKeep away from this world and proceed towards the next world infatuatedly. Do not regard\nhumble he whom fear Allah has given a high position, and do not accord a high position to\nhim whom this world has given a high position.\nDo not keep your eyes on the shining clouds of the world, do not listen to him who speaks of\nit, do not respond to him who calls towards it, do not seek light from its glare, and do not die\nin its precious things, because its brightness is deceitful, its words are false, its wealth is liable\nto be looted, and its precious thing are to be taken away.\nBeware, this world attracts and then turns away. It is stubborn, refusing to go ahead. It speaks\nlies and misappropriates. It disowns and is ungrateful. It is malicious and abandons (its\nlovers).\nIt attracts but causes trouble. Its condition is changing, its step shaking, its honour disgrace,\nits seriousness jest, and its height lowliness. It is a place of plunder and pillage, and ruin and\ndestruction. Its people are ready with their feet to drive, to overtake and to depart.\nIts routes are bewildering, its exits are baffling, and its schemes end in disappointment.\nConsequently, strongholds betray them, houses throw them out and cunning fails them.\nSome of them are like hocked camel, some like butchered meat, some like severed limbs,\nsome like spilt blood, some are biting their hands (in pain) some are rubbing their palms (in\nremorse), some are holding their cheeks on their hands (in anxiety), some are cursing their\nown views and some are retreating from their determination.\nBut the time for action has gone away and the hour of calamity has approached, while (there\nwas no longer) the time to escape (Qur'an, 38:3). Alas! Alas! what has been lost is lost! what\nhas gone is gone! The world has passed in its usual manner.\nSo wept not on them the heavens and the earth nor were they respited. (Qur'an,\n44:29)"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_192.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_192.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"jP93LzsmwY"}
