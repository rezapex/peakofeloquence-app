We stand witness that Muhammad is His slave and His\nMessenger.\nHe entered every hardship in search of Allah's pleasure and endured for its sake every grief.\nHis near relations changed themselves for him and those who were remote from him (in\nrelationship) united against him. The Arabs let loose the reins (of their horses to quicken their\nmarch) against him, and struck the bellies of their carriers to (rouse them) in fighting against\nhim, so much so that enemies came to his threshold from the remotest places and most distant\nareas.\nI advise you, O' creatures of Allah, to fear Allah and I warn you of the hypocrites, because\nthey are themselves misguided and misguide others, and they have slipped and make others\nslip too. They change into many colours, and adopt various ways. They support you with all\nsorts of supports, and lay in waiting for you at every lookout.\nTheir hearts are diseased while their faces are clean. They walk stealthily and tread like the\napproach of sickness (over the body). Their words speak of cure, but their acts are like\nincurable diseases. They are jealous of ease, intensify distress, and destroy hopes.\nTheir victims are found lying down on every path, while they have means to approach every\nheart and they have (false) tears for every grief.\nThey eulogise each other and expect reward from each other. When they ask something they\ninsist on it, if they reprove (any one) they disgrace (him), and if they pass verdict they commit\nexcess. They have adopted for every truth a wrong way, for every erect thing a bender, for\nevery living being a killer, for every (closed) door a key and for every night a lamp. They\ncovet, but with despair, in order to maintain with it their markets, and to popularise their\nhandsome merchandise.\nWhen they speak they create doubts. When they describe they exaggerate. First they offer\neasy paths but (afterwards) they make them narrow. In short, they are the party of Satan and\nthe stings of fire.\nSatan hath gained hold on them, so he maketh them forget the remembrance of\nAllah; they are Satan's Party; Beware! verily, the party of Satan are the losers.\n(Qur'an, 58:19)"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_195.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_195.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"YFIw3T2DOn"}
