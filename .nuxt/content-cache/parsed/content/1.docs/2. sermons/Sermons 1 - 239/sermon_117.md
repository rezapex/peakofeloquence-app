Everyone would then have cared for his own self without paying attention to anyone else.\nBut you have forgotten what was recalled to you and felt safe from what you had been\nwarned. Consequently, your ideas went astray and your affairs were dispersed.\nI do long that Allah may cause separation between me and you and give me those who have a\nbetter right to be with me than you. By Allah, they are people of blissful ideas, enduring\nwisdom and true speech.\nThey keep aloof from revolt. They trod forward on the path (of Allah) and ran on the high\nroad. Consequently, they achieved the everlasting next life and easeful honours.\nBeware! by Allah, a tall lad of swinging gait from Banu Thaqif would be placed over you.

The detail of this incident is that one day al-Hajjaj stood up for saying prayers when alkhunfusa'\nadvanced towards him. al-Hajjaj held out his hand to stop him but he bit him\nwhereby his hand got swollen and eventually he died of it. Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written that \"al-\nWadhahah\" means the dung that remains sticking to the tail of an animal, and this surname is\nintended to disgrace him."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_117.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_117.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"n5oHIUvx2Y"}
