He is such that senses cannot perceive Him, place cannot contain Him,\neyes cannot see Him and veils cannot cover Him. He proves His eternity by the coming into\nexistence of His creation, and (also) by originating His creation (He proves) His existence,\nand by their (mutual) similarity He proves that there is nothing similar to Him. He is true in\nHis promise. He is too high to be unjust to His creatures.\nHe stands by equity among His creation and practices justice over them in His commands. He\nprovides evidence through the creation of things of His being from ever, through their marks\nof incapability of His power, and through their powerlessness against death of His eternity.\nHe is One, but not by counting. He is everlasting without, any limit. He is existent without\nany support. Minds admit of Him without (any activity of the) senses. Things which can be\nseen stand witness to Him without confronting Him. Imagination cannot encompass Him. He\nmanifests Himself to the imagination with his help for the imagination, and refuses to be\nimagined by the imagination. He has made imagination the arbiter (in this matter).\nHe is not big in the sense that volume is vast and so His body is also big. Nor is He great in\nthe sense that His limits should extend to the utmost and so His frame be extensive. But He is\nbig in position and great in authority.\nAbout the Holy Prophet\nI stand witness that Muhammad is His slave, His chosen Prophet and His responsible trustee\n-- may Allah bless him and his descendants. Allah sent him with undeniable proofs, a clear\nsuccess and open paths. So he conveyed the message declaring the truth with it. He led the\npeople on the (correct) highway, established signs of guidance and minarets of light, and\nmade Islam's ropes strong and its knots firm.\nA part of the same sermon\nAbout the creation of animal species\nHad they pondered over the greatness of His power and the vastness of His bounty they\nwould have returned to the right path and feared the punishment of the Fire; but hearts are\nsick and eyes are impure.\nDo they not see the small things He has created, how He strengthened their system and\nopened for them hearing and sight and made for them bones and skins? Look at the ant with\nits small body and delicate form. It can hardly be seen in the corner of the eye, nor by the\nperception of the imagination - how it moves on the earth and leaps at its livelihood. It carries\nthe grain to its hole and deposits it in its place of stay.\nIt collects during the summer for its winter, and during strength for the period of its weakness.\nIts livelihood is guaranteed, and it is fed according to fitness. Allah, the Kind, does not forget\nit and (Allah the Giver) does not deprive it, even though it may be in dry stone or fixed rocks.\nIf you have thought about its digestive tracts in its high and low parts, the carapace of its\nbelly, and its eyes and its ears in its head you would be amazed at its creation and you would\nfeel difficulty in describing it. Exalted is He who made it stand on its legs and erected it on its\npillars (of limbs). No other originator took part with Him in its origination and no one having\npower assisted Him in its creation.\nIf you tread on the paths of your imagination and reach its extremity it will not lead you\nanywhere except that the Originator of the ant is the same as He who is the Originator of the\ndate-palm, because everything has (the same) delicacy and detail, and every living being has\nlittle difference.\nThe Creation of the Universe\nIn His creation, the big, the delicate, the heavy, the light, the strong, the weak are all equal.(1)\nSo is the sky, the air, the winds and the water. Therefore, you look at the sun, moon,\nvegetation, plants, water, stone, the difference of this night and day, the springing of the\nstreams, the large number of the mountains, the height of their peaks, the diversity of\nlanguages and the variety of tongues. Then woe be to him who disbelieves in the Ordainer\nand denies the Ruler. They believe that they are like grass for which there is no cultivator nor\nany maker for their diverse shapes.\nThey have not relied on any argument for what they assert, nor on any research for what they\nhave heard. Can there be any construction without a Constructor, or any offence without an\noffender.\nThe wonderful creation of the locust\nIf you wish you can tell about the locust (as well). Allah gave it two red eves, lighted for them\ntwo moon -- like pupils, made for it small ears, opened for it a suitable mouth and gave it\nkeen sense, gave it two teeth to cut with and two sickle-like feet to grip with. The farmers are\nafraid of it in the matter of crops since they cannot drive it away even though they may join\ntogether. The locust attacks the fields and satisfies its desires (of hunger) from them although\nits body is not equal to a thin finger.\nAbout the Glory of Allah\nGlorified is Allah before Whom every one in the skies or the earth bows in prostration\nwillingly or unwillingly, submits to Him by placing his cheeks and face (in the dust), drops\nbefore Him (in obedience) peacefully and humbly, and hands over to Him full control in fear\nand apprehension.\nThe birds are bound by His commands. He knows the number of their feathers and their\nbreaths. He has made their feet to stand on water and on land. He has ordained their\nlivelihoods. He knows their species: this is the crow, this is the eagle, this is the pigeon and\nthis is the ostrich. He called out every bird with its name (while creating it) and provided it\nwith its livelihood.\nHe created heavy clouds and produced from them heavy rain and spread it on various lands.\nHe drenched the earth after its dryness and grew vegetation from it after its barrenness.\n(1). The meaning is that if the smallest thing in creation is examined it will be found to contain\nall that which is found in the biggest creatures, and each will exhibit the same reflection of\nnatures, workmanship and performance, and the ratio of each to Allah's might and power will\nbe the same, whether it be as small as an ant or as big as a date palm. Is it not that making a\nsmall thing is easy for Him while the making of a big thing is difficult for Him, because the\ndiversity of colour, volume and quantity is just based on the dictates of His sagacity and\nexpediency, but as regards creation itself there is no difference among them. Therefore, this\nuniformity of creation is a proof of the oneness and unity of the Creator."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_186.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_186.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"EVQKemIjyn"}
