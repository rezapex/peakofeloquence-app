Whoever testifies to this falsifies the\nQur'an and becomes unmindful of Allah in achieving his desired objective and in warding off\nthe undesirable.\nYou cherish saying this so that he who acts on what you say should praise you rather than\nAllah because according to your misconception you have guided him about the hour in which\nhe would secure benefit and avoid harm.\nThen Amir al-mu'minin advanced towards the people and said:\nO' People! Beware of learning the science of stars except that with which guidance is sought\non land or sea, because it leads to divining and an astrologer is a diviner, while the diviner is\nlike the sorcerer, the sorcerer is like the unbeliever and the unbeliever would be in Hell. Get\nforward in the name of Allah.\n(1). When Amir al-mu'minin decided to march towards Nahrawan to suppress the rising of the\nKharijites, `Afif ibn Qays al-Kindi said to him, \"This hour is not good. If you set out at this time.\nthen instead of victory and success you will face defeat and vanquishment.\n\" But Amir al-mu'minin paid no heed to his view and ordered the army to march that very\nmoment. In the result the Kharijites suffered such a clear defeat that out of their nine\nthousand combatants only nine individuals saved their lives by running away while the rest\nwere killed.\nAmir al-mu'minin has argued about astrology being wrong or incorrect in three ways, firstly,\nthat if the view of an astrologer is accepted as correct it would mean falsification of the Qur'an,\nbecause an astrologer claims to ascertain hidden things of the future by seeing the stars while\nthe Qur'an says:\nSay: \"None (either) in the heavens or in the earth knoweth the unseen save\nAllah... \" (27:65)\nSecondly that under his misconception the astrologer believes that he can know his benefit or\nharm through knowing the future. In that case he would be regardless of turning to Allah and\nseeking His help, while this indifference towards Allah and self-reliance is a sort of heresy and\natheism, which puts an end to his hope in Allah.\nThirdly, that if he succeeds in any objective, he would regard this success to be the result of\nhis knowledge of astrology, as a result of which he would praise himself rather than Allah, and\nwill expect that whomever he guides in this manner he too should be grateful to him rather\nthan to Allah .\nThese points do not apply to astrology to the extent it may be believed that the astrological\nfindings are in the nature of effect of medicines which are subject to alteration at the will of\nAllah. The competence achieved by most of our religious scholars in astrology is correct in this\nvery ground that they did not regard its findings as final."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_80.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_80.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"LTo46hl5qm"}
