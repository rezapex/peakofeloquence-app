His tribe is the best tribe and his lineal tree the best lineal tree whose branches are in\ngood proportion and fruits hanging (in plenty).\nHis birth-place was Mecca, and the place of his immigration Taybah (Medina), from where\nhis name rose high and his voice spread far and wide.\nAllah sent him with a sufficing plea, a convincing discourse and a rectifying announcement.\nThrough him Allah disclosed the ways that had been forsaken, and destroyed the innovations\nthat had been introduced. Through him He explained the detailed commands.\nNow, whoever adopts a religion other than Islam, his misery is definite, his stick (of support)\nwill be cracked, his fate will be serious, his end will be long grief and distressing punishment.\nDrawing lessons from this world\nI trust in Allah, the trust of bending towards Him, and I seek His guidance for the way that\nleads to His Paradise and takes to the place of His pleasure.\nI advise you, O' creatures of Allah, to exercise fear of Allah and to obey Him because it is\nsalvation tomorrow and deliverance for ever. He warned (you of chastisement) and did so\nthoroughly.\nHe persuaded (you towards virtues) and did so fully. He described this world, its cutting away\nfrom you, its decay and its shifting. Therefore, keep aloof from its attractions, because very\nlittle of it will accompany you. This house is the closest to the displeasure of Allah and the\nremotest from the pleasure of Allah.\nSo close your eyes, O' creatures of Allah, from its worries and engagements, because you are\nsure about its separation and its changing conditions.\nFear it like a sincere fearer and one who struggles hard, and take a lesson from what you have\nseen about the falling places of those before you, namely that their joints were made to\nvanish, their eyes and ears were destroyed, their honour and prestige disappeared and their\npleasure and wealth came to an end. The nearness of their children changed into remoteness.\nThe company of their spouses changed into separation with them. They do not boast over\neach other, nor do they beget children nor meet each other nor live as neighbours. Therefore,\nfear O' creature of Allah, like the fear of one who has control over himself, who can check his\npassions and perceive with his wisdom. Surely, the matter is quite clear, the banner is\nstanding, the course is level and the way is straight."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_162.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_162.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"HGapexgW1t"}
