Surely, they are now demanding a right which they have abandoned and\nblood which they have themselves shed.\nIf I partook in it with them then they too have a share in it, but if they committed it without\nme the demand should be against them. The first step of their justice should be that they pass\nverdict against themselves. I have my intelligence with me.\nI have never mixed matters nor have they appeared mixed to me. Certainly, this is the\nrebellious group in which there is the near one (az-Zubayr), the scorpion's venom (`A'ishah)\nand doubts which cast a veil (on facts). But the matter is clear, and the wrong has been shaken\nfrom its foundation.\nIts tongue has stopped uttering mischief. By Allah, I will prepare for them a cistern from\nwhich I alone will draw water. They will not be able to drink from it nor would they be able\nto drink from any other place.\nA part of the same sermon\nYou advanced towards me shouting \"allegiance, allegiance\" like shecamels having delivered\nnewly born young ones leaping towards their young. I held back my hand but you pulled it\ntowards you., I drew back my hand but you dragged it. O' my Allah! these two have ignored\nmy rights and did injustice to me. They both have broken allegiance to me, and roused people\nagainst me. Unfasten Thou what they have fastened, and do not make strong what they have\nwoven.\nShow them the evil in what they aimed at and acted upon.\nBefore fighting I asked them to be steadfast in allegiance and behaved with them with\nconsideration but they belittled the blessing and refused (to adopt the course of) safety."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_138.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_138.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"q5g7a2SZXE"}
