He to whom\nexperiences have clearly shown the past exemplary punishments (given by Allah to peoples)\nis prevented by piety from falling into doubts. You should know that the same troubles have\nreturned to you which existed when the Prophet was first sent.\nBy Allah who sent the Prophet with faith and truth you will be severely subverted, bitterly\nshaken as in sieving and fully mixed as by spooning in a cooking pot till your low persons\nbecome high and high ones become low, those who were behind would attain forward\npositions and those who were forward would become backward. By Allah, I have not\nconcealed a single word or spoken any lie and I had been informed of this event and of this\ntime.\nBeware that sins are like unruly horses on whom their riders have been placed and their reins\nhave been let loose so that they would jump with them in Hell. Beware that piety is like\ntrained horses on whom the riders have been placed with the reins in their hands, so that they\nwould take the riders to Heaven. There is right and wrong and there are followers for each. If\nwrong dominates, it has (always) in the past been so, and if truth goes down that too has often\noccurred. It seldom happens that a thing that lags behind comes forward.\nash-Sharif ar-Radi says: In this small speech there is more beauty than can be appreciated,\nand the quantity of amazement aroused by it is more than the appreciation accorded to it.\nDespite what we have stated it has so many aspects of eloquence that cannot be expressed nor\ncan anyone reach its depth, and no one can understand what I am saying unless one has\nattained this art and known its details.\n. . . No one appreciates it except those who know (Qur'an, 29:43)\nFrom the same Sermon\nHe who has heaven and hell in his view has no other aim. He who attempts and acts quickly,\nsucceeds, while the seeker who is slow may also entertain hope, and he who falls short of\naction faces destruction in Hell. On right and left there are misleading paths. Only the middle\nway is the (right) path which is the Everlasting Book and the traditions of the Prophet. From it\nthe sunnah has spread out and towards it is the eventual return.\nHe who claims (otherwise) is ruined and he who concocts falsehood is disappointed. He who\nopposes(1) right with his face gets destruction. It is enough ignorance for a man not to know\nhimself. He who is strong rooted(2) in piety does not get destruction, and the plantation of a\npeople based on piety never remains without water. Hide yourselves in your houses and\nreform yourselves. Repentance is at your back. One should praise only Allah and condemn\nonly his own self.\n(1). In some versions after the words \"man abda safhatahu lilhaqqi halaka:\" the words \"`inda\njahalati'n-nas\" also occur. In that case the meaning of this sentence would be that he who\nstands in face of right dies in the estimation of the ignorant.\n(2). Piety is the name of heart and mind being affected and impressed by the Divine Greatness\nand Glory, as an effect of which the spirit of man becomes full of fear of Allah, and its\ninevitable result is that engrossment in worship and prayer increases. It is impossible that heart\nmay be full of Divine fear and there be no manifestation of it in actions and deeds. And since\nworship and submission reform the heart and nurture the spirit, purity of heart increases with\nthe increase of worship.\nThat is why in the Qur'an \"taqwa\" (piety) has been applied sometimes to fear, sometimes to\nworship and devotion and sometimes to purity of heart and spirit. Thus in the verse \"wa iyyaya\nfattaqun\" (and Me you fear "},{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"16:2"}]},{"type":"text","value":") taqwa implies fear, in the verse, \"ittaqu'l-laha haqqa\ntuqatihi\" (worship Allah as He ought to be worshipped "},{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"3:102"}]},{"type":"text","value":"), taqwa implies worship and\ndevotion and in the verse \"wa yakhsha'l-laha wa yattaqhi faulaika humu'l-faizun\" (24:52) taqwa\nimplies purity of spirit and cleanliness of heart.\nIn the traditions taqwa has been assigned three degrees. The first degree is that a man should\nfollow the injunctions and keep aloof from prohibitions. The second degree is that\nrecommended matters should also be followed and disliked things should be avoided. The third\ndegree is that for fear of falling into doubts one may abstain from the permissible as well. The\nfirst degree is for the common men, the second for the nobles and the third for high\ndignitaries. Allah has referred to these three degrees in the following verse:\nOn those who believe and do good, is no blame for what they ate, (before) when they did\nguard themselves and did believe, and did good, still (furthermore) they guard themselves and\ndo good; and Allah loveth the doers of good. (Qur'an, 5:93)\nAmir al-mu'minin says that only action based on piety is lasting, and only that action will\nblossom and bear fruit which is watered by piety because worship is only that wherein the\nfeeling of submission exists. Thus, Allah says:\nIs he therefore better who hath laid his foundation on fear of Allah and (His) goodwill or he\nwho layeth his foundation on the brink of a crumbling hollowed bank so it crumbled down with\nhim into the fire of Hell... (Qur'an, 9:109)\nConsequently, every such belief as is not based on knowledge and conviction is like the edifice,\nerected without foundation, wherein there is no stability or firmness while every action that is\nwithout piety is like the plantation which withers for lack of watering."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_16.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_16.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"Iiin0PCRWj"}
