Sweat would\nflow upto their mouths like reins while the earth would be trembling under them.\nIn the best condition among them would be he who has found a resting place for both his feet\nand an open place for his breath.\nA part of the same sermon about future troubles (fitan)\nThe troubles are like a dark night. Horses would not stand for (facing) them nor would their\nbanners turn back. They would approach in full reins and ready with saddles. Their leader\nwould be driving them and the rider would be exerting (them).\nThe trouble-mongers are a people whose attacks are severe. Those who would fight them for\nthe sake of Allah would be a people who are low in the estimation of the proud, unknown in\nthe earth but well known on the sky. Woe to you O' Basrah, when an army of Allah's\ninfliction would face upon you without (raising) dust of cries. Your inhabitants would then\nface bloody death and dire hunger."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_103.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_103.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"nlU9rLttq6"}
