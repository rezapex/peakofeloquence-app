Make fear of Allah the routine of your life. Cover yourselves with\npeace of mind and clinch your teeth because this makes the sword slip off from the skull.\nComplete your armour and shake your swords in their sheathes before showing them out.\nHave your eyes on the enemy. Use your spears on both sides and strike (the enemy) with\nswords. Keep in mind that you are before Allah and in the company of the Prophet's cousin.\nRepeat your attacks and feel ashamed of running away, because it is a shame for posterity and\n(cause of awarding you) fire on the Day of Judgement. Give your lives (to Allah) willingly\nand walk towards death with ease.\nBeware of this great majority, and the pitched tent and aim at its centre because Satan is\nhiding in its cornet. He has extended his hand for assault and has kept back his foot for\nrunning away. Keep one enduring till the light of Truth dawns upon you.\nWhile ye have the upper hand, and Allah is with you, and never will He depreciate your\ndeeds. (Qur'an, 47:35)"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_67.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_67.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"Ud83aJs3Ym"}
