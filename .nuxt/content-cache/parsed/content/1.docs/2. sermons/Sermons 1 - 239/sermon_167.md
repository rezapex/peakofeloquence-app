Some of them will stick\nto the branches, and bending down as the branches bend, until Allah, the Sublime, will collect\nthem together for the day that will be worst for the Umayyads just as the scattered bits of\nclouds collect together in the autumn. Allah will create affection among them.\nThen He will make them into a strong mass like the mass of clouds. Then he will open doors\nfor them to flow out from their starting place like the flood of the two gardens (of Saba') from\nwhich neither high rocks remained safe nor small hillocks, and its flow could be repulsed\nneither by strong mountains nor by high lands.\nAllah will scatter them in the low lands of valleys and then He will make them flow like\nstreams throughout the earth, and through them He will arrange the taking of rights of one\npeople by another people and make one people to stay in the houses of another people.\nBy Allah, all their position and esteem will dissolve as fat dissolves on the fire.\nThe cause of tyranny\nO' people! If you had not evaded support of the truth and had not felt weakness from crushing\nwrong then he who was not your match would not have aimed at you and he who\noverpowered you would not have overpowered you. But you roamed about the deserts (of\ndisobedience) like Banu Isra'il (Children of Israel).\nI swear by my life that after me your tribulations will increase several times, because you will\nhave abandoned the truth behind your backs, severed your connection with your near ones\nand established relations with remote ones.\nKnow that if you had followed him who was calling you (to guidance) he would have made\nyou tread the ways of the Prophet, then you would have been spared the difficulties of\nmisguidance, and you would have thrown away the crushing burden from your necks.\n(1). The implication is that the outer Islam of these people required that they should not be\nmolested, but the consequence of sparing them in this way was that they would create\nmischief and rebellion."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_167.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_167.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"LWi4GPiRgq"}
