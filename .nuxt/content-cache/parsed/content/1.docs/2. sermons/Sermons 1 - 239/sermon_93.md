Consequently, they rushed for swearing allegiance in the same way as a traveller who had lost his way and catches sight of the objective would have rushed towards it, as the historian at-Tabari (in at-Tarikh, vol .I, pp. 3066, 3067, 3076) records: People thronged on Amir al-mu'minin and said, \"We want to swear allegiance to you and you see what troubles are befalling Islam and how we are being tried about the near ones of the Prophet.\" But Amir al-mu'minin declined to accede to their request whereupon these people raised a hue and cry and began to shout loudly, \"O' Abu'l-Hasan, do you not witness the ruination of Islam or see the advancing flood of unruliness and mischief? Do you have no fear of Allah?\" Even then Amir al-mu'minin showed no readiness to consent because he was noticing that the effects of the atmosphere that had come into being after the Prophet had overcome hearts and minds of the people, selfishness and lust for power had become rooted in them, their thinking affected by materialism and they had become habituated to treating government as the means for securing their ends. Now they would like to materialise the Divine Caliphate too and play with it. In these circumstances it would be impossible to change the mentalities or turn the direction of temperaments. In addition to these ideas he had also seen the end in view that these people should get further time to think over so that on frustration of their material ends hereafter they should not say that the allegiance had been sworn by them under a temporary expediency and that thought had not been given to it, just as "}]},{"type":"text","value":"Umar's idea was about the first Caliphate, which\nappears from his statement that:\nAbu Bakr's Caliphate came into being without thought but Allah saved us from\nits mischief. If anyone repeats such an affair you should kill him.

Leave me and select someone else who may fulfil your ends. You have\nseen my past life that I am not prepared to follow anything except the Qur'an and sunnah and\nwould not give up this principle for securing power. If you select someone else I would pay\nregard to the laws of the state and the constitution as a peaceful citizen should do.\nI have not at any stage tried to disrupt the collective existence of the Muslims by inciting\nrevolt. The same will happen now. Rather, just as keeping the common good in view I have\nhitherto been giving correct advice, I would not grudge doing the same.\nIf you let me in the same position it would be better for your worldly ends, because in that\ncase I won't have power in my hands so that I could stand in the way of your worldly affairs,\nand create an impediment against your hearts' wishes. However, if you are determined on\nswearing allegiance on my hand, bear in mind that if you frown or speak against me I would\nforce you to tread on the path of right, and in the matter of the right I would not care for\nanyone.\nIf you want to swear allegiance even at this, you can satisfy your wish.\"\nThe impression Amir al-mu'minin had formed about these people is fully corroborated by later\nevents. Consequently, when those who had sworn allegiance with worldly motives did not\nsucceed in their objectives they broke away and rose against his government with baseless\nallegations."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_93.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_93.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"MAkJNWLmMN"}
