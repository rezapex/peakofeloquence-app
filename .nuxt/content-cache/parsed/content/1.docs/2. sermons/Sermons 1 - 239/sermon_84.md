I\npraise Him for His continuous mercy and His copious bounties.\nI believe in Him as He is the First of all and He is Manifest. I seek guidance from Him as He\nis Near and is the Guide. I seek His succour as He is Mighty and Subduer.\nI depend upon Him as He is Sufficer and Supporter. And I stand witness that Muhammad\n(blessing of Allah be on him and his progeny) is His slave and His Prophet.\nHe sent him for enforcement of His commands, for exhausting His pleas and for presenting\nwarnings (against eternal punishment).\nEnjoining people to Piety\nO' creatures of Allah I advise you to have fear of Allah Who has furnished illustrations and\nWho has timed for you your lives. He has given you covering of dress(1) and He has scattered\nfor you livelihood. He has surrounded you with His knowledge. He has ordained rewards. He\nhas bestowed upon you vast bounties and extensive gifts. He has warned you through far\nreaching arguments, and He has counted you by numbers. He has fixed for you ages (to live)\nin this place of test and house of instruction.\nYou are on test in this world and have to render account about it.\nCaution against this world\nCertainly this world is a dirty watering place and a muddy source of drinking.\nIts appearance is attractive and its inside is destructive. It is a deception, a vanishing reflection\nand a bent pillar. When its despiser begins to like it and he who is not acquainted with it feels\nsatisfied with it, then it raises and puts down its feet (in joy), entraps him in its trap, makes\nhim the target of its arrows and puts round his neck the rope of death taking him to the narrow\ngrave and fearful abode in order to show him his place of stay and the recompense of his acts.\nThis goes on from generation to generation. Neither death stops from cutting them asunder\nnor do the survivors keep aloof from committing of sins.\nDeath and Resurrection\nThey are emulating each other and proceeding in groups towards the final objective and the\nrendezvous of death, till when matters come to a close, the world dies and resurrection draws\nnear. Allah(2) would take them out from the corners of the graves, the nests of birds. the dens\nof beasts and the centres of death. They hasten towards Him command and run towards the\nplace fixed for their final return group by group, quiet, standing and arrayed in rows. They\nwill be within Allah's sight and will hear every one who would call them.\nThey would be having the dress of helplessness and covering of submission and indignity. (At\nthis time) contrivances would disappear, desires would be cut, hearts would sink quietly,\nvoices would be curbed down, sweat would choke the throat, fear would increase and ears\nwould resound with the thundering voice of the announcer calling towards the final\njudgement, award of recompense, striking of punishment and paying of reward.\nThe limitations of life\nPeople have been created as a proof of (His) power, have been brought up with authority, they\nare made to die through pangs, and placed in graves where they turn into crumbs. Then they\nwould be resurrected one by one, awarded their recompense and would have to account for\ntheir actions, each one separately. They had been allowed time to seek deliverance, had been\nshown the right path and had been allowed to live and seek favours, the darkness of doubts\nhad been removed, and they had been let free in this period of life as a training place in order\nto make preparation for the race on the Day of Judgement, to search for the objective with\nthoughtfulness, to get time necessary to secure benefits and provide for the next place of stay.\nNo happiness without Piety\nHow appropriate are these illustrations and effective admonitions provided they are received\nby pure hearts, open ears, firm views and sharp wits. Fear Allah like him who listened (good\nadvice) and bowed before it, when he committed sin he admitted it, when he felt fear he acted\nvirtuously, when he apprehended he hastened (towards good acts), when he believed he\nperformed virtuous acts, when he was asked to take lesson (from the happenings of this\nworld) he did take the lesson, when he was asked to desist he abstained (from evil), when he\nresponded to the call (of Allah) he leaned (towards him), when he turned back (to evil) he\nrepented, when he followed he almost imitated and when he was shown (the right path) he\nsaw it.\nSuch a man was busy in search of truth and got rid (of the worldly evils) by running away. He\ncollected provision (of good acts) for himself, purified his inner self, built for the next world,\nand took with himself provision for the day of his departure, keeping in view his journey, his\nrequirement and the position of his need. He sent ahead of him for the abode of his stay (in\nthe next world). O' creatures of Allah, fear Allah keeping in view the reason why He created\nyou and be afraid of Him to the extent He has advised you to do. Make yourself deserve what\nHe has promised you, by having confidence in the truth of His promise and entertaining fear\nfor the Day of Judgement.\nA part of the same sermon\nReminding people of Allah's bounties\nHe has made for you ears to preserve what is important, eyes to have sight in place of\nblindness and limbs which consist of many (smaller) parts, whose curves are in proportion\nwith the moulding of their shapes and lengths of their ages, and also bodies that are sustaining\nthemselves and hearts that are busy in search of their food, besides other big bounties,\nobliging bestowings and fortresses of safety. He has fixed for you ages that are not known to\nyou. He has retained for you remains of the past people for your instruction. Those people\nenjoyed themselves fully and were completely unhampered.\nDeath overtook them before (satisfaction of) their desires, from which the hands of death\nseparated them. They did not provide for themselves during health of their bodies, and did not\ntake lesson during their youth.\nAre these people who are in youth waiting for the backbending old age, and those enjoying\nfresh health waiting for ailments, and these living persons looking for the hour of death?\nWhen the hour of departure would be close and the journey at hand, with pangs of grief and\ntrouble, suffering of sorrows and suffocation of saliva, and the time would arrive for calling\nrelations and friends for help and changing sides on the bed.\nCould then the near ones stop death, or the mourning women do any good? He would rather\nbe left alone in the graveyard confined to the narrow corner of his grave.\nHis skin has been pierced all over by reptiles, and his freshness has been destroyed by these\ntribulations. Storms have removed his traces and calamities have obliterated even his signs.\nFresh bodies have turned thin and withered and bones have become rotten. The spirits are\nburdened with the weight of sins and have become conscious of the unknown things. But now\nneither the good acts can be added to nor evil acts can be atoned for by repentance.\nAre you not sons, fathers, brothers and relations of these dead and are not to follow their\nfootsteps and pass by their paths? But hearts are still unmoved, heedless of guidance and\nmoving on wrong lines, as though the addressee is someone else, and as though the correct\nway is to amass worldly gains.\nPreparation for the Day of Judgement\nAnd know that you have to pass over the pathway (of sirat) where steps waver, feet slip away\nand there are fearful dangers at every step. O' creatures of Allah, fear Allah, like the fearing of\nwise man whom the thought (of next world) has turned away from other matters, fear (of\nAllah) has afflicted his body with trouble and pain, his engagement in the night prayer has\nturned even his short sleep into awakening, hope (of eternal recompense) keeps him thirsty in\nthe day, abstention has curbed his desires, and remembrance of Allah is ever moving his\ntongue.\nHe entertains fear before dangers. He avoids uneven ways in favour of clear ones. He follows\nthe shortest route to secure his purpose, wishfulness does not twist his thinking and\nambiguities do not blind his eyes. He enjoys deep sleep and passes his day happily because of\nthe happiness of good tidings and pleasure of (eternal bounties).\nHe passes the pathway of this world in praiseworthy manner. He reaches the next world with\nvirtues. He hastens (towards virtue) out of fear (for vice). He moves briskly during the short\ntime (of life in this world). He devotes himself in seeking (eternal good), he runs away from\nevil. During today he is mindful of tomorrow, and keeps the future in his view. Certainly\nParadise is the best reward and achievement, which hell is appropriate punishment and\nsuffering. Allah is the best Avenger and Helper and the Qur'an is the best argument and\nconfronter.\nWarning against Satan\nI enjoin upon you fear of Allah Who has left no excuse against what He has warned, has\nexhausted argument (of guidance) about the (right) path He has shown. He has warned you of\nthe enemy that steals into hearts and stealthily speaks into ears, and thereby misguides and\nbrings about destruction, makes (false) promises and keeps under wrong impression, he\nrepresents evil sins in attractive shape, and shows as light even serious crimes. When he has\ndeceived his comrades and exhausted the pledge he begins to find fault with what he\npresented as good, and considers serious what he had shown as light, and threatens from what\nhe had shown as safe.\nPart of the same sermon dealing with creation of man\nOr look at man whom Allah has created in the dark wombs and layers of curtains from what\nwas overflowing semen, then shapeless clot, then embryo, then suckling infant, then child and\nthen fully grown up young man. Then He gave him heart with memory, tongue to talk and eye\nto see with, in order that he may take lesson (from whatever is around him) and understand it\nand follow the admonition and abstain from evil.\nWhen he attained the normal growth and his structure gained its average development he fell\nin self-conceit and got perplexed. He drew bucketfuls of his desires, got immersed in\nfulfilling his wishes for pleasures of the world and his (sordid) aims. He did not fear any evil\nnor got frightened of any apprehension. He died infatuated with his vices. He spent his short\nlife in rubbish pursuits.\nHe earned no reward nor did he fulfil any obligation. Fatal illness overtook him while he was\nstill in his enjoyments and perplexed him. He passed the night in wakefulness in the hardships\nof grief and pricking of pains and ailments in the presence of real brother, loving father,\nwailing mother, crying sister, while he himself was under maddening uneasiness, serious\nsenselessness, fearful cries, suffocating pains, anguish of suffocating sufferings and the pangs\nof death.\nThereafter he was clad in the shroud while he remained quiet and thoroughly submissive to\nothers. Then he was placed on planks in such a state that he had been down-trodden by\nhardships and thinned by ailments. The crowd of young men and helping brothers carried him\nto his house of loneliness where all connections of visitors are severed. Thereafter those who\naccompanied him went away and those who were wailing for him returned and then he was\nmade to sit in his grave for terrifying questioning and slippery examination.\nThe great calamity of that place is the hot water and entry into Hell, flames of eternal Fire and\nintensity of blazes. There is no resting period, no gap for ease, no power to intervene, no\ndeath to bring about solace and no sleep to make him forget pain. He rather lies under several\nkinds of deaths and moment-to-moment punishment. We seek refuge with Allah.\nThe lesson to be learnt from those who have passed away\nO' creatures of Allah! where are those who were allowed (long) ages to live and they enjoyed\nbounty. They were taught and they learnt; they were given time and they passed it in vain;\nthey were kept healthy and they forgot (their duty). They were allowed long period (of life),\nwere handsomely provided, were warned of grievous punishment and were promised big\nrewards. You should avoid sins that lead to destruction and vices that attract wrath (of Allah).\nO' people who possess eyes and ears and health and wealth! Is there any place of protection,\nany shelter of safety, or asylum or haven, or occasion to run away or to come back (to this\nworld)? If not, \"how are you then turned away\" (Qur'an, 6:95; 10:34; 35:3; 40:62) and wither\nare you averting? By what things have you been deceived? Certainly, the share of every one\nof you from this earth is just a piece of land equal to his own stature and size where he would\nlie on his cheeks covered with dust. The present is an opportune moment for acting.\nO' creatures of Allah, since the neck is free from the loop, and spirit is also unfettered, now\nyou have time for seeking guidance: you are in ease of body; you can assemble in crowds, the\nrest of life is before you; you have opportunity of acting by will; there is opportunity for\nrepentance, and peaceful circumstances. (But you should act) before you are overtaken by\nnarrow circumstances and distress, or fear and weakness, before the approach of the awaited\ndeath and before seizure by the Almighty, the Powerful.\nas-Sayyid ar-Radi says: It is related that when Amir al-mu'minin delivered this sermon people\nbegan to tremble, tears flowed from their eyes and their hearts were frightened. Some people\ncall this sermon the Brilliant Sermon (al-Khutbatu'l-Gharra')\n(1). Allah has furnished every creature with natural dress, which is the means of protecting it\nfrom cold and heat. Thus, some animals are covered in feathers and some carry apparels of\nwool on their bodies. But the high degree of intelligence of man and the quality of shame and\nmodesty in him demands distinction from other creatures. Consequently, to maintain this\ndistinction he has been taught the ways of covering his body. It was this natural impulse that\nwhen Adam was made to give up his dress he began to cover his body with leaves. The Qur'an\nsays:\nSo when they tested (of) the tree their shameful things got displayed unto them\nand they began covering themselves with leaves of the garden ... (Qu'ran, 7:22)\nThis was the punishment awarded for his committing what was better for him to omit. When\nremoval of dress is punishment its putting on would be a favour, and since this is peculiar to\nman it has been particularly mentioned. (2). The intention is that Allah would resurrect all the\ndead, even though they had been eaten by beasts and been merged in their bodies. Its aim is\nto refute the view of the philosophers who hold that the resurrection of the non-existent is\nimpossible and who do not therefore believe in the physical resurrection. Their argument\nbriefly is that a thing which has lost existence by death cannot return to life.\nConsequently, after the destruction of this world the return of any of its beings to life is out of\nquestion. But this belief is not correct because dispersal of the parts does not mean its nonexistence,\nso as to say that putting these parts together again would involve resurrection of\nthe non-existent.\nOn the other hand separated and dispersed parts continue to exist in some form or the other.\nOf course, in this connection this objection has some force that when every person is to be\nresurrected in his own form, then in case one person has eaten the other, then in such a case\nit would be impossible to resurrect either of them with his own constituent parts, since this\nwould involve creating deficiency of parts in that who had eaten the other.\nTo this metaphysicians have replied that in everybody there are some constituents which are\nessential and others which are non-essential. The essential constituents remain constant from\nthe beginning till end of life and suffer no change or alteration, and resurrection with regard to\nsuch constituents would not create any deficiency in the man who ate the other."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_84.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_84.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"LlFHtjBV3L"}
