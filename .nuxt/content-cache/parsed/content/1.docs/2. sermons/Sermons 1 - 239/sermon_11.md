However, Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah was prominent in righteousness and piety, sublime in renunciation and worship, lofty in knowledge and achievements and heir of his father in bravery. His performance in the battles of Jamal and Siffin had created such impression among the Arabs that even warriors of consequence trembled at his name.

When\nduring the battle of Siffin Muhammad mentioned this matter to Amir al-mu'minin in\ncomplaining tone he replied, \"You are my right hand whereas they are my eyes, and the hand\nshould protect the eyes.\"\nApparently it seems that first Amir al-mu'minin must have given this reply and thereafter\nsomeone might have mentioned it to Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah and he must have repeated\nthe same reply as there could be no more eloquent reply than this one and its eloquence\nconfirms the view that it was originally the outcome of the eloquent tongue of Amir almu'minin\nand was later appropriated by Muhammad al-Hanafiyyah. Consequently, both these\nviews can be held to be correct and there is no incongruity between them.\nHowever, he was born in the reign of the second Caliph and died in the reign of `Abd al-Malik\nibn Marwan at the age of sixty-five years. Some writers have recorded the year of his death as\n80 A.H. and others as 81 A.H. There is a difference about the place of his death as well. Some\nhave put it as Medina, some Aylah and some Ta'if.\n(2). When in the Battle of Jamal Amir al-mu'minin sent Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah to the\nbattle-field, he told him that he should fix himself before the enemy like the mountain of\ndetermination and resoluteness so that the onslaught of the army should not be able to\ndisplace him, and should charge the enemy with closed teeth because by pressing teeth over\nthe teeth tension occurs in the nerves of the skull as a result of which the stroke of the sword\ngoes amiss, as he said at another place also viz. \"Press together the teeth. It sends amiss the\nedge of the sword.\n\" Then he says, \"My child, lend your head to Allah in order that you may be able to achieve\neternal life in place of this one, because for a lent article there is the right to get it back.\nTherefore, you should fight being heedless of your life, otherwise also if your mind clings to life\nyou will hesitate to advance towards deathly encounters and that would tell upon your\nreputation of bravery. Look, don't let your steps falter because the enemy is emboldened at\nthe faltering of steps, and faltering steps fastens the feet of the enemy.\nKeep the last lines of the enemy as your aim so that the enemy may be overawed with\nloftiness of your intentions and you may feel ease in tearing through their lives, and their\nmovement should also not remain concealed from you. Look, do not pay heed to their\nsuperiority in numbers, otherwise your valour and courage would suffer.\" This sentence can\nalso mean that one should not wide open the eyes to be dazzled by the shining of weapons,\nand the enemy may make an attack by taking advantage of the situation. Also, always bear it\nin mind that victory is from Allah. \"If Allah helps you no one can overpower you.\" Therefore,\ninstead of relying on material means seek His support and succour.\nRemember O' ye Believers!) If Allah helpeth you, none shall overcome you...(Qur'an, 3:159)"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_11.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_11.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"pzFks1a442"}
