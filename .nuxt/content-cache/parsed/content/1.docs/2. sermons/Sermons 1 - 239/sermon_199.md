I\nstand witness that Muhammad is the choice of Allah, the conveyor of His revelation and the\nmessenger of His mercy.\nAdvantages of fear of Allah\nNow then, I advise you to fear Allah, Who created you for the first time; towards Him is your\nreturn, with Him lies the success of your aims, at Him terminate (all) your desires, towards\nHim runs your path of right and He is the aim of your fears (for seeking protection).\nCertainly, fear of Allah is the medicine for your hearts, sight for the blindness of your spirits,\nthe cure for the ailments of your bodies, the rectifier of the evils of your breasts, the purifier\nof the pollution of your minds, the light of the darkness of your eyes, the consolation for the\nfear of your heart and the brightness for the gloom of your ignorance.\nTherefore, make obedience to Allah the way of your life and not only your outside covering,\nmake it your inner habit instead of only outer routine, subtle enough to enter through your ribs\n(up to the heart), the guide for all your affairs, the watering place for your getting down (on\nthe Day of Judgement), the interceder for the achievement of your aims, asylum for the day of\nyour fear, the lamp of the interior of your graves, company for your long loneliness, and\ndeliverance from the troubles of your abodes.\nCertainly, obedience to Allah is a protection against encircling calamities. expected dangers\nand the flames of burning fires.\nTherefore, whoever entertains fear of Allah, troubles remain away from him after having been\nnear, affairs become sweet after their bitterness, waves (of troubles) recede from him after\nhaving crowded over him, difficulties become easy for him after occurring, generosity rains\nfast over him after there had been famine, mercy bends over him after it had been loath, the\nfavours (of Allah) spring forth on him after they had been dried, and blessing descends over\nhim in showers after being scanty.\nSo, fear Allah Who benefits you with His good advice, preaches to you through His\nMessenger, and obliges you with His favours. Devote yourselves to His worship, and acquit\nyourselves of the obligation of obeying Him.\nAbout Islam\nThis Islam is the religion which Allah has chosen for Himself, developed it before His eyes,\npreferred it as the best among His creations, established its pillars on His love. He has\ndisgraced other religions by giving honour to it.\nHe has humiliated all communities before its sublimity; He has humbled its enemies with His\nkindness and made its opponents lonely by according it His support. He has smashed the\npillars of misguidance with its columns. He has quenched the thirst of the thirsty from its\ncisterns, and filled the cisterns through those who draw its water.\nHe made Islam such that its constituent parts cannot break, its links cannot separate, its\nconstruction cannot fall, its columns cannot decay, its plant cannot be uprooted, its time does\nnot end, its laws do not expire, its twigs cannot be cut, its parts do not become narrow, its ease\ndoes not change into difficulty, its clarity is not affected by gloom, its straightness does not\nacquire curvature, its wood has no crookedness, its vast paths have no narrowness, its lamp\nknows no putting off and its sweetness has no bitterness.\nIt consists of columns whose bases Allah has fixed in truthfulness and whose foundation He\nhas strengthened, and of sources whose streams are ever full of water and of lamps, whose\nflames are full of light, and of beacons with whose help travellers get guidance, and of signs\nthrough which a way is found to its highways and of watering places which provide water to\nthose who come to them. Allah has placed in Islam the height of His pleasure, the pinnacle of\nHis pillars and the prominence of His obedience.\nBefore Allah, therefore, its columns are strong, its construction is lofty, its proofs are bright,\nits fires are aflame, its authority is strong, its beacons are high and its destruction is difficult.\nYou should therefore honour it, follow it, fulfil its obligations and accord the position due to\nit.\nAbout the Holy Prophet\nThen, Allah, the Glorified, deputed Muhammad - the peace and blessing of Allah be upon\nhim and his descendants - with truth at a time when the destruction of the world was near and\nthe next life was at hand, when its brightness was turning into gloom after shining, it had\nbecome troublesome for its inhabitants, its surface had become rough, and its decay had\napproached near.\nThis was during the exhaustion of its life at the approach of signs (of its decay), the ruin of its\ninhabitants, the breaking of its links, the dispersal of its affairs, the decay of its signs, the\ndivulging of its secret matters and the shortening of its length. Allah made him responsible for\nconveying His message and (a means of) honour for his people, a period of bloom for the men\nof his days, a source of dignity for the supporters and an honour for his helpers.\nAbout the Holy Qur'an\nThen, Allah sent to him the Book as a light whose flames cannot be extinguished, a lamp\nwhose gleam does not die, a sea whose depth cannot be sounded, a way whose direction does\nnot mislead, a ray whose light does not darken, a separator (of good from evil) whose\narguments do not weaken, a clarifier whose foundations cannot be dismantled, a cure which\nleaves no apprehension for disease, an honour whose supporters are not defeated, and a truth\nwhose helpers are not abandoned.\nTherefore, it is the mine of belief and its centre, the source of knowledge and its oceans, the\nplantation of justice and its pools, the foundation stone of Islam and its construction, the\nvalleys of truth and its plains, an ocean which those who draw water cannot empty, springs\nwhich those who draw water cannot dry up, a watering place which those who come to take\nwater cannot exhaust, a staging place in moving towards which travellers do not get lost,\nsigns which no treader fails to see and a highland which those who approach it cannot surpass\nit.\nAllah has made it a quencher of the thirst of the learned, a bloom for the hearts of religious\njurists, a highway for the ways of the righteous, a cure after which there is no ailment, an\neffulgence with which there is no darkness, a rope whose grip is strong, a stronghold whose\ntop is invulnerable, an honour for him who loves it, a peace for him who enters it, a guidance\nfor him who follows it, an excuse for him who adopts it, an argument for him who argues\nwith it, a witness for him who quarrels with it, a success for him who argues with it, a carrier\nof burden for him who seeks the way, a shield for him who arms himself (against\nmisguidance), a knowledge for him who listens carefully, worthy story for him who relates it\nand a final verdict of him who passes judgements."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_199.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_199.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"RgWKqkAE2U"}
