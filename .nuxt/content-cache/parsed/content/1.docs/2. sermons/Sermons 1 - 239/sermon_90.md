Evils were raising heads, all matters were under disruption and in\nflames of wars, while the world was devoid of brightness, and full of open deceitfulness. Its\nleaves had turned yellow and there was absence of hope about its fruits.\nWhile water had gone underground. The minarets of guidance had disappeared and signs of\ndestruction had appeared. It was stern to its people and frowned in the face of its seeker. Its\nfruit was vice and its food was carcass. Its inner dress was fear and outer cover was sword.\nSo take lesson, O' creatures of Allah, and recall that (evil doing) with which your fathers and\nbrothers are entangled, and for which they have to account. By my life, your time is not much\nbehind theirs, nor have long periods or centuries lapsed between you and them, nor are you\nmuch distant from when you were in their loins.\nBy Allah, whatever the Prophet told them, I am here telling you the same and whatever you\nhear today is not different from what they heard yesterday.\nThe eyes that were opened for them and the hearts that were made for them at that time, just\nthe same have been given to you at this time. By Allah, you have not been told anything that\nthey did not know and you have not been given anything which they were deprived.\nCertainly you have been afflicted by a calamity (which is like a she-camel) whose nose-string\nis moving about and whose strap is loose So in whatever condition these deceitful people are\nshould not deceive you, because it is just a long shadow whose term is fixed."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_90.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_90.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"xHC7jCIdDK"}
