Ibn Maytham writes that when the Battle of Jamal ended then on the third day after it\nAmir al-mu'minin said the morning prayer in the central mosque of Basrah and after finishing it\nstood on the right side of the prayer place reclining against the wall and delivered this sermon\nwherein he described the lowness of character of the people of Basrah and their slyness,\nnamely that they got enflamed at others' instigation without anything of their own and making\nover their command to a woman clung to a camel.\nThey broke away after swearing allegiance and exhibited their low character and evil nature by\npractising double facedness.

In short, killing and looting prevailed all round. Neither anyone's life was secure nor was there any way to save one's honour or property. When Amir al-mu'minin was informed of the march to Basrah he set out to stop it with a force which consisted of seventy of those who had taken part in the battle of Badr and four hundred out of those companions who had the honour of being present at the Allegiance of Ridwan (Divine Pleasure).

First of all Amir al-mu'minin announced in his army that no one should attack\nanother, nor take the initiative.

Till now Amir al-mu'minin had\nnot allowed an attack as a result of which the enemy continued feeling encouraged and went\non raining arrows constantly. At last with the dying of a few valiant combatants consternation\nwas created among Amir al-mu'minin's ranks and some people came with a few bodies before\nhim and said, \"O' Commander of the faithful you are not allowing us to fight while they are\ncovering us with arrows.\nHow long can we let them make our bosoms the victim of their arrows, and remain handfolded\nat their excesses?\" At this Amir al-mu'minin did show anger but acting with restraint and\nendurance, came to the enemy in that very form without wearing armour or any arm and\nshouted, \"Where is az-Zubayr?\" At first az-Zubayr hesitated to come forward but he noticed\nthat Amir al-mu'minin had no arms he came out. Amir al-mu'minin said to him \"O' az-Zubayr,\nyou must remember that one day the Prophet told you that you would fight with me and\nwrong and excess would be on your side.\" az-Zubayr replied that he had said so. Then Amir almu'minin\nenquired \"Why have you come then?\" He replied that his memory had missed it and\nif he had recollected it earlier he would not have come that way. Amir al-mu'minin said, \"Well,\nnow you have recollected it\" and he replied, \"Yes.\" Saying this he went straight to "},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"A'ishah and told her that he was getting back.

However, it is gratifying that some consideration was accorded to the Prophet's saying, for at Haw'ab even after recollection of the Prophet's words no more than transient effect was taken of it. On returning after this conversation Amir al-mu'minin observed that they had attacked the right and left flanks of his army. Noticing this Amir al-mu'minin said, \"Now the plea has been exhausted. Call my son Muhammad. \" When he came Amir al-mu'minin said, \"My son, attack them now.\" Muhammad bowed his head and taking the standard proceeded to the battle-field. But arrows were falling in such exuberance that he had to stop. When Amir al-mu'minin saw this he called out at him, \"Muhammad, why don't you advance?\" He said, \"Father, in this shower of arrows there is no way to proceed. Wait till the violence of arrows subsides.\" He said, \"No, thrust yourself in the arrows and spears and attack.\" Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah advanced a little but the archers so surrounded him that he had to hold his steps. On seeing this a frown appeared on Amir al-mu'minin's fore-head and getting forward he hit the sword's handle on the Muhammad's back and said, \"This is the effect of your mother's veins.\" Saying this he took the standard from his hands and folding up his sleeves made such and attack that a tumult was created in the enemy's ranks from one end to the other. To whichever row he turned, it became clear and to whatever side he directed himself bodies were seen falling and heads rolling in the hoofs of horses. When after convulsing the rows he returned to his position he said to Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, \"Look, my son, battle is fought like this.\" Saying this he gave the standard to him and ordered him to proceed. Muhammad advanced towards the enemy with a contingent of ansar. The enemy also came out moving and balancing their spears. But the brave son of the valiant father convulsed rows over rows while the other warriors also made the battle-field glory and left heaps of dead bodies. From the other side also there was full demonstration of spirit of sacrifice. Dead bodies were falling one over the other but they continued sacrificing their lives devotedly around the camel. Particularly the condition of Banu Dabbah was that although their hands were being severed from the elbows for holding the reins of the camel, and bosoms were being pierced yet they had the following battle-song on their tongues: a) To us death is sweeter than honey. We are Banu Dabbah, camel rearers. b) We are sons of death when death comes. We announce the death of "}]},{"type":"text","value":"Uthman with the\nedges of spears.\nc) Give us back our chief and there is an end to it.\nThe low character and ignorance from faith of these Banu Dabbah, can be well understood by\nthat one incident which al-Mada'ini has narrated. He writes that in Basrah there was a man\nwith mutilated ear. He asked him its reason when he said, \"I was watching the sight of dead\nbodies in the battle-field of Jamal when I saw a wounded man who sometimes raised his head\nand sometimes dashed it back on the ground. I approached near. Then the following two\nverses were on his lips:\na) Our mother pushed us into the deep waters of death and did not get back till we had\nthoroughly drunk.\nb) By misfortune we obeyed Banu Taym who are none but slave men and slave girls.\n\"I told him it was not the time to recite verses; he should rather recall Allah and recite the\nkalimat ash-shahadah (verse of testimony). On my saying this he saw me with angry looks and\nuttering a severe abuse and said, \"You are asking me to recite kalimat ash-shahadah, get\nfrightened at the last moment and show impatience.\" I was astonished to hear this and\ndecided to return without saying anything further.\nWhen he saw me returning he said, \"Wait; for your sake I am prepared to recite, but teach\nme.\" I drew close to teach him the kalimah when he asked me to get closer. When I got closer\nhe caught my ear with his teeth and did not leave it till he tore it from the root. I\ndid not think it proper to molest a dying man and was about to get back abusing and cursing\nhim when he asked me to listen one more thing.\nI agreed to listen lest he had an unsatisfied wish.
