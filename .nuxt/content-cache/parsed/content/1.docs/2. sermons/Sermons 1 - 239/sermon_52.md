They are against the Book of Allah.\nPeople co-operate with each other about them even though it is against the Religion of Allah.\nIf wrong had been pure and unmixed it would not be hidden from those who are in search of it.\nAnd if right had been pure without admixture of wrong those who bear hatred towards it\nwould have been silenced. What is, however, done is that something is taken from here and\nsomething from there and the two are mixed! At this stage Satan overpowers his friends and\nthey alone escape for whom virtue has been apportioned by Allah from before."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_52.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_52.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"FfQNkvQLyQ"}
