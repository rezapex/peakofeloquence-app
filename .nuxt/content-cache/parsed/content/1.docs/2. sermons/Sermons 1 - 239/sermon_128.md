You are\nconfusing those who have committed sins with those who have not.\nYou know that the Prophet (PBUH) stoned the protected (married) adulterer, then he also said\nhis burial prayer and allowed his successors to inherit from him. He killed the murderer and\nallowed his successors to inherit from him. He amputated (the hand of) the thief and whipped\nthe unprotected (unmarried) adulterer, but thereafter allowed their shares from the booty, and\nthey married Muslim women.\nThus the Prophet (PBUH) took them to ask for their sins and also abided by Allah's\ncommands about them, but did not disallow them their rights created by Islam, nor did he\nremove their names from its followers.\nCertainly you are the most evil of all persons and are those whom Satan has put on his lines\nand thrown out into his wayless land. With regard to me, two categories of people will be\nruined, namely he who loves me too much and the love takes him away from rightfulness, and\nhe who hates me too much and the hatred takes him away from rightfulness.\nThe best man with regard to me is he who is on the middle course. So be with him and be\nwith the great majority (of Muslims) because Allah's hand (of protection) is on keeping unity.\nYou should beware of division because the one isolated from the group is (a prey) to Satan\njust as the one isolated from the flock of sheep is (a prey) to the wolf.\nBeware; whoever calls to this course, kill him, even though he may be under this headband of\nmine. Certainly the two arbitrators were appointed to revive what the Qur'an revives and to\ndestroy what the Qur'an destroys. Revival means to unite on it (in a matter) and destruction\nmeans to divide on a matter.\nIf the Qur'an drives us to them we should follow them, and if it drives them to us they should\nfollow up. May you have no father! (Woe to you), I did not cause you any misfortune, nor\nhave I deceived you in any matter, nor created any confusion.\nYour own group had unanimously suggested in favour of these two men and we bound them\nthat they would not exceed the Qur'an but they deviated from it and abandoned the right\nalthough both of them were conversant with it.\nThis wrong-doing was the dictate of their hearts and so they trod upon it, although we had\nstipulated that in arbitrating with justice and sticking to rightfulness they would avoid the evil\nof their own views and the mischief of their own verdict (but since this has happened the\naward is not acceptable to us)."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_128.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_128.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"1vgE1pcWxK"}
