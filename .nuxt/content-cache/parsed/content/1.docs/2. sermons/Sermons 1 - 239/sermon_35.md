Then Amir\nal-mu'minin said to me, \"What is the price of this shoe?\" I said: \"It has no value now.\" He\nthen said, \"By Allah, it should have been more dear to me than ruling over you but for the fact\nthat I may establish right and ward off wrong.\" Then he came out and spoke:\nVerily, Allah sent Muhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.p.) when none among the Arabs read a book or\nclaimed prophethood. He guided the people till he took them to their (correct) position and\ntheir salvation. So their spears (i.e. officers) became straight and their conditions settled\ndown.\nBy Allah, surely I was in their lead till it took shape with its walls. I did not show weakness or\ncowardice. My existing march is also like that. I shall certainly pierce the wrong till right\ncomes out of its side.\nWhat (cause of conflict) is there between me and the Quraysh? By Allah, I have fought them\nwhen they were unbelievers and I shall fight them when they have been misled. I shall be the\nsame for them today as I was for them yesterday.\nBy Allah, the Quraysh only take revenge against us because Allah has given us (i.e. the Holy\nProphet and his progeny) preference over them. So, we have allowed them into our domain,\nwhereupon they have become as the former poet says:\nBy my life, you continued drinking fresh milk every morning,\nAnd (continued) eating fine stoned dates with butter;\nWe have given you the nobility which you did not possess before;\nAnd surrounded (protected) you with thoroughbred horses and tawny-coloured\nspears (strong spears) (1).\n(1). In fact, the aim of the poet here is to say that the condition of the addressee's life, from\nthe moral and material point of view, had been worse in the past, and that the poet and his\ntribe have given him the best means of leading their lives.\nBut as the result of this improved condition the addressee has completely lost himself and\nforgotten his past condition and thinks that he had had this kind of life previously.\nNow, Amir al-mu'minin wants to convey the same idea here to the Quraysh as Fatimah (p.b.u.\nh.) the holy daughter of the Holy Prophet said in her speech on Fadak:\n(O' People) ... You were on the brink of the pit of Hell Fire (Qur'an, 3:103). You were as\nworthless as the mouthful of water. You were minority like the handful greedy and a spark of\nthe hasty. You were as down-trodden as the dust under feet. You drank dirty water. You ate\nuntanned skin. You were abased and condemned. But Allah has rescued you through my father\nMuhammad (p.b.u.h.a.h.p.). . ."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_35.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_35.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"ezqlgUxPwS"}
