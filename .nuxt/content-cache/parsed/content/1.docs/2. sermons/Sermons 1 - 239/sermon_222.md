(Qur'an, 24:36-37)\nCertainly, Allah, the Glorified, the Sublime, has made His remembrance the light for hearts\nwhich hear with its help despite deafness, see with its help despite blindness and become\nsubmissive with its help despite unruliness.\nIn all the periods and times when there were no prophets, there have been persons with whom\nAllah, precious are His bounties, whispered through their wits and spoke through their minds.\nWith the help of the bright awakening of their ears, eyes and hearts they keep reminding\nothers of the remembrance of the days of Allah and making others feel fear for Him like\nguide-points in wildernesses.\nWhoever adopts the middle way, they praise his ways and give him the tidings of deliverance,\nbut whoever goes right and left they vilify his ways and frighten him with ruin. In this way,\nthey served as lamps in these darknesses and guides through these doubts.\nThere are some people devoted to the remembrance (of Allah) who have adopted it in place of\nworldly matters so that commerce or trade does not turn them away from it. They pass their\nlife in it. They speak into the ears of neglectful persons warning against matters held unlawful\nby Allah, they order them to practise justice and themselves keep practising it, and they\nrefrain them from the unlawful and themselves refrain from it. It is as though they have\nfinished the journey of this world towards the next world and have beheld what lies beyond it.\nConsequently, they have become acquainted with all that befell them in the interstice during\ntheir long stay therein, and the Day of Judgement fulfils its promises for them. Therefore,\nthey removed the curtain from these things for the people of the world, till it was as though\nthey were seeing what people did not see and were hearing what people did not hear.\nIf you picture them in your mind in their admirable positions and well-known sittings, when\nthey have opened the records of their actions and are prepared to render an account of\nthemselves in respect of the small as well as the big things they were ordered to do but they\nfailed to do, or were ordered to refrain from but they indulged therein, and they realised the\nweight of their burden (of bad acts) on their backs, and they felt too weak to bear them, then\nthey wept bitterly and spoke to each other wile still crying and bewailing to Allah in\nrepentance and acknowledgement (of their shortcomings), you would find them to be\nemblems of guidance and lamps in darkness, angels would be surrounding them, peace would\nbe descending upon them, the doors of the sky would be opened for them and positions of\nhonour would be assigned to them in the place of which Allah had informed them.\nTherefore, He has appreciated their actions and praised their position.They call Him and\nbreathe in the air of forgiveness, they are ever needy of His bounty and remain humble before\nHis greatness, the length of their grief has pained their hearts, and the length of weeping their\neves. They knock at every door of inclination towards Allah. They ask Him Whom generosity\ndoes not make destitute and from Whom those who approach Him do not get disappointed.\nTherefore, take account of yourself for your own sake because the account of others will be\ntaken by one other than you."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_222.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_222.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"dOdCAVKvwN"}
