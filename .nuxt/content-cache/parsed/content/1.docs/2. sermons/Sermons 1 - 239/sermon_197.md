He who lives in it has\nto depart, and he who stays here has to leave it. It is drifting with its people like a boat whom\nsevere winds dash (here and there) in the deep sea.\nSome of them get drowned and die, while some of them escape on the surface of the waves,\nwhere winds push them with their currents and carry them towards their dangers. So,\nwhatever is drowned cannot be restored, and whatever escapes is on the way to destruction.\nO' creatures of Allah, you should know now that you have to perform (good) acts, because (at\npresent) your tongues are free, your bodies are healthy, your limbs have movement, the area\nof your coming and going is vast and the course of your running is wide; before the loss of\nopportunity or the approach of death.\nTake death's approach as an accomplished fact and do not think it will come (hereafter)."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_197.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_197.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"631i1n2AfD"}
