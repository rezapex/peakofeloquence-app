I performed his (funeral) ablution, may Allah bless him and his descendants, and the\nangels helped me. The house and the courtyard were full of them.\nOne party of them was descending and the other was ascending. My ears continually caught\ntheir humming voice, as they invoked Allah's blessing on him, till we buried him in his grave.\nThus, who can have greater rights with him than I during his life or after his death? Therefore\ndepend on your intelligence and make your intentions pure in fighting your enemy, because I\nswear by Him who is such that there is no god but He, that I am on the path of truth and that\nthey (the enemy) are on the misleading path of wrong.\nYou hear what I say; and I seek Allah's forgiveness for myself and for you.\n(1). Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written (in Sharh Nahj al-balaghah, vol. 10, pp. 180-183) that Amir almu'minin's\nsaying that he never disobeyed the commands of the Prophet is a sort of taunt to\nthose who felt no hesitation in rejecting the Prophet's commands and sometimes even checked\nhim.\nFor example, when, at the time of the peace of al-Hudaybiyah, the Prophet was agreeable to\nnegotiate peace with the unbelievers among the Quraysh, one of the companions became so\nenraged that he expressed doubts about the prophethood of the Prophet whereupon Abu Bakr\nhad to say:\nWoe be to you! Keep clinging to him. He is certainly Allah's Messenger and He\nwill not ruin him.\nThe introduction to the oath, 'inna', and the word of emphasis 'lam' which are used here to\ncreate conviction about the prophethood shows that the addressee had gone farther than mere\ndoubt, because these words of emphasis are employed only when the stage of denial has been\nreached. However, if belief required absence of doubt, the presence of doubt must imply\ndefect in the belief, as Allah says:\nThe believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, they doubt\nnot thereafter,... (Qur'an, 49:15)\nSimilarly, when the Prophet intended to say the funeral prayers of Ubayy ibn Salul the same\ncompanion said to him, \"How do you intend to seek forgiveness for this Chief of hypocrites?\"\nAnd he even drew away the Prophet by catching the skirt (of his shirt).\nThen the Prophet had to say, \"No act of mine is beside the command of Allah\". In the same\nway the Prophet's command to accompany the force of Usamah ibn Zayd was ignored. The\ngreatest of all these insolences was displayed in connection with the Prophet's intention to\nwrite down his advice as to when such a blame was laid against the Prophet which proves an\nabsence of belief in the commands of the shari"},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{"className":[]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"ah, and creates a doubt about each command as to whether it is based on divine revelation or (Allah may forbid) just the result of mental disorder.
