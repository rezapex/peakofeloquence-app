I stand witness that there\nis no god but Allah and I stand witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Prophet (peace\nbe upon him and his progeny) and his chosen and his selected one.\nMuhammad's (p.b.u.h.a.h.p.) distinction cannot be paralleled nor can his loss be made good.\nPopulated places were brightened through him when previously there was dark misguidance,\noverpowering ignorance and rude habits, and people regarded unlawful as lawful, humiliated\nthe man of wisdom, passed lives when there were no prophets and died as unbelievers.\nYou, O' people of Arabia, will be victims of calamities which have come near. You should\navoid the intoxication of wealth, fear the disasters of chastisement, keep steadfast in the\ndarkness and crookedness of mischief when its hidden nature discloses itself, its secrets\nbecome manifest and its axis and the pivot of its rotation gain strength.\nIt begins in imperceptible stages but develops into great hideousness. Its youth is like the\nyouth of an adolescent and its marks are like the marks of beating by stone.\nOppressors inherit it by (mutual) agreement. The first of them serves as a leader for the latter\none and the latter one follows the first one. They vie with each other in (the matter of) this\nlowly world, and leap over this stinking carcass. Shortly the follower will denounce his\nconnection with the leader, and the leader with the follower.\nThey will disunite on account of mutual and curse one another when they meet. Then after\nthis there will appear another arouser of mischief who will destroy ruined things. The heart\nwill become wavering after being normal, men will be misled after safety, desires will\nmultiply and become diversified and views will become confused.\nWhoever proceeds towards this mischief will be ruined and whoever strives for it will be\nannihilated. They will be biting each other during it as the wild asses bite each other in the\nherd. The coils of the rope will be disturbed and the face of affairs will be blinded. During it\nsagacity will be on the ebb, and the oppressors will (get the opportunity to) speak. This\nmischief will smash the Bedouins with its hammers and crush them with its chest.\nIn its dust the single marchers will be lost, and in its way the horsemen will be destroyed. It\nwill approach with the bitterness of destiny and will give pure blood (instead of milk).\nIt will breach the minarets of faith and shatter the ties of firm belief. The wise will run away\nfrom it while the wicked will foster it. It will thunder and flash (like lightning). It will create a\nsevere disaster. In it kinship will be forsaken and Islam will be abandoned. He who declaims\nit will also be affected by it, and he who flees from it will (be forced to) stay in it.\nA part of the same sermon\nAmong them some will be unavenged martyrs and some will be stricken with fear and seek\nprotection. They will be deceived by pledges and fraudulent belief. You should not become\nlandmarks of mischiefs and signs of innovations but should adhere to that on which the rope\nof the community has been wound and on which the pillars of obedience have been founded.\nProceed towards Allah as oppressed and do not proceed to Him as oppressors.\nAvoid the paths of Satan and the places of revolt. Do not put in your bellies unlawful morsels\nbecause you are facing Him Who has made disobedience unlawful for you, and made the path\nof obedience easy for you."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_152.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_152.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"hLedurQN2R"}
