Certainly, the evil (Satan) has\nmisguided you. Do you feel no pity for your wife and your children? Do you believe that if\nyou use those things which Allah has made lawful for you, He will dislike you? You are too\nunimportant for Allah to do so.\nHe said: O' Amir al-mu'minin, you also put on coarse dress and eat rough food.\nThen he replied: Woe be to you, I am not like you. Certainly, Allah, the Sublime, has made it\nobligatory on true leaders that they should maintain themselves at the level of low people so\nthat the poor do not cry over their poverty. (1)\n(1) From ancient days asceticism and the abandonment of worldly attachments has been\nregarded as a means of purification of the spirit and important for the character. Consequently,\nthose who wished to lead a life of abstemiousness and meditation used to go out of the cities\nand towns to stay in forests and caves in the mountains and stay there concentrating on Allah\naccording to their own conception.\nThey would eat only if a casual traveller or the inhabitant of nearby dwellings gave them\nanything to eat, otherwise they remained contented with the fruits of wild trees and the water\nof the streams, and thus they passed their life. This way of worship commenced in a way that\nwas forced by the oppression and hardships of rulers.\nCertain people left their houses and, in order to avoid their grip, hid themselves in some\nwilderness or cave in a mountain, engaging themselves in worship of and devotion to Allah.\nLater on, this forced asceticism acquired a voluntary form and people began to retire to caves\nand hollows of their own volition.\nThus it became an accepted way that whoever aimed at spiritual development retired to some\ncorner after severing himself from all worldly ties. This method remained in vogue for centuries\nand even now some traces of this way of worship are found among the Buddhists and the\nChristians.\nThe moderate views of Islam do not, however, accord with the monastic life, because for\nattaining spiritual development it does not advocate the abandonment of worldly enjoyments\nand successes, nor does it view with approbation that a Muslim should leave his house and\nfellow men and busy himself in formal worship, hiding in some corner.\nThe conception of worship in Islam is not confined to a few particular rites, but it regards the\nearning of one's livelihood through lawful means, mutual sympathy and good behaviour, and\nco-operation and assistance also to be important constituents of worship. If an individual\nignores worldly rights and obligations and does not fulfil his responsibility towards his wife and\nchildren, nor occupies himself in efforts to earn a livelihood, but all the time stays in\nmeditation, he ruins his life and does not fulfil the purpose of living. If this were Allah's aim,\nwhat would have the need for creating and populating the world when there was already a\ncategory of creatures who were all the time engaged in worshipping and adoration.\nNature has made man to stand on the cross-roads at which the midway is the centre of\nguidance. If he deviates from this point of moderateness even a bit, this way or that way,\nthere is shear misguidance for him. That midway is that he should neither bend towards this\nworld to such an extent as to ignore the next life, devoting himself entirely to this one, nor\nshould he abstain from this world so as not to have any connection with anything of it,\nconfining himself to some corner leaving everything else. Since Allah has created man in this\nworld he should follow the code of life for living in this world, and should partake of the\ncomforts and pleasures bestowed by Allah within moderate limits.\nThe eating and using of things made lawful by Allah is not against Allah's worship, but rather\nAllah has created these things for the very purpose that they should be taken advantage of.\nThat is why those who were the chosen of Allah lived in this world with others and ate and\ndrank like others. They did not feel the need to turn their faces away from the people of the\nworld, and to adopt the wilderness or the caves of mountains as their abodes, or to live in\ndistant spots. On the other hand they remembered Allah, remained disentangled from worldly\naffairs, and did not forget death despite the pleasures and comforts of life.\nThe life of asceticism sometimes produces such evils as ruin the next life also as well as this\none, and such an individual proves to be the true picture of \"the looser in this life as well as\nthe next.\" When natural impulses are not satisfied in the lawful and legal way the mind turns\ninto a centre of evil-ideas and becomes incapable of performing worship with peace and\nconcentration; and sometimes passions so overcome the ascetic that breaking all moral fetters,\nhe devotes himself completely to their satisfaction and consequently falls in an abyss of ruin for\nwhich it is impossible to extract himself.\nThat is why religious law accords a greater position to the worship performed by a family man\nthan that by a non-family man, because the former can exercise mental peace and\nconcentration in the worship and rituals.\nIndividuals who put on the cloak of Sufism and make a loud show of their spiritual greatness\nare cut off from the path of Islam and are ignorant of its wide teachings. They have been\nmisled by Satan and, relying on their self-formed conceptions, tread wrongful paths. Eventually\ntheir misguidance becomes so serious that they begin to regard their leaders as having\nattained such a level that their word is as the word of Allah and their act is as the act of Allah.\nSometimes they regard themselves beyond all the bounds and limitations of religious law and\nconsider every evil act to be lawful for them. This deviation from faith and irreligiousness is\nnamed Sufism (complete devotion to Allah).\nIts unlawful principles are called \"at-tariqah\" (ways of achieving communion with Allah) and\nthe followers of this cult are known as Sufis. First of all Abu Hashim al-Kufi and Shami adopted\nthis nickname. He was of Umayyad descent and a fatalist (believing that man is bound to act\nas pre-ordained by Allah). The reason for giving him this name was that, in order to make a\nshow of his asceticism and fear for Allah, he put on a woollen cloak. Later on this nickname\nbecame common and various grounds were put forth as the basis of this name.\nFor example, one ground is that 'Sufi' has three letters, \"sad\", \"waw\" and \"fa'\". \"sad\" stands for\n\"sabr\" (endurance), \"sidq\" (truthfulness) and \"safa\" (purity of heart); \"waw\" stands for\n\"wudd\" (love), \"wird\" (repeating Allah's name) and \"wafa'\" (faithfulness to Allah), and \"fa'\"\nstands for \"fard\" (unity), \"faqr\" (destitution) and \"fana'\" (death or absorption in Allah's Self).\nThe second view is that it has been derived from \"as-Suffah\", which was a platform near the\nProphet's mosque which had a covering of date-palm leaves. Those who stayed there were\ncalled Ashabu'Suffah (people of the platform). The third view is that the name of the\nprogenitor of an Arab tribe was Sufah, and this tribe performed the duties of serving the\npilgrims and the Ka`bah, and it is with reference to their connection with this tribe that these\npeople were called Sufis. This group is divided among various sects but the basic sects are\nseven only."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ol","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"al-Wahdatiyyah (unitarian):\nThis sect believes in the oneness of all existence.
