The ears which do not listen to the cries may become deaf.\nHow can one who remained deaf to the loud cries (of the Qur'an and the Prophet) listen to\n(my) feeble voice. The heart that has ever palpitated (with fear of Allah) may get peace.\nI always apprehended from you consequences of treachery and I had seen you through in the\ngarb of the deceitful. The curtain of religion had kept me hidden from you but the truth of my\nintentions disclosed you to me.\nI stood for you on the path of truth among misleading tracks where you met each other but\nthere was no leader and you dug but got no water.\nToday I am making these dumb things speak to you (i.e. my suggestive ideas and deep\nmusings etc.) which are full of descriptive power. The opinion of the person who abandons\nme may get astray. I have never doubted in the truth since it has been shown to me.\nMusa (Moses) (1) did not entertain fear for his own self. Rather he apprehended mastery of\nthe ignorant and away of deviation. Today we stand on the cross-roads of truth and untruth.\nThe one who is sure of getting water feels no thirst.\n(1). The reference is to that even of Moses when sorcerers were sent for to confront him and\nthey showed their sorcery by throwing ropes and sticks on the ground and Moses felt afraid.\nThus, the Qur'an records:\n. . . it seemed to him (Moses), by their sorcery as if they were running.Then\nMoses felt in himself a fear. We said: Fear not! Verily thou art the uppermost.\n(20:66-68)\nAmir al-mu'minin says that the ground for Moses fear was not that since he saw ropes and\nsticks moving he might have entertained fear for his life but the cause of his fear was lest\npeople be impressed with this sorcery and get astray, and untruth might prevail on account of\nthis craft. That is why Moses was not consoled by saying that his life was safe but by saying\nthat he would prove superior, and his claim would be upheld.\nSince his fear was for the defeat of the truth and victory of the untruth, not for his own life,\nthe consideration was given to him for the victory of truth and not for the protection of his life.\nAmir al-mu'minin also means that he too had the same fear viz. that the people should not be\ncaught in the trap of these (Talhah, az-Zubayr, etc.) and fail into misguidance by getting astray\nfrom the true faith. Otherwise, he himself never feared for his own life."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_4.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_4.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"wyEeXpfsXl"}
