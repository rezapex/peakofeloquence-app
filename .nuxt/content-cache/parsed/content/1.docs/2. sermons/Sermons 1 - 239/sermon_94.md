No one\nexcept me advanced towards it when its gloom was swelling and its madness was intense.\nAsk me before you miss me,(2) because, by Allah, who has my life in His hands, if you ask\nme anything between now and the Day of Judgement or about the group who would guide a\nhundred people and also misguide a hundred people I would tell you who is announcing its\nmarch, who is driving it in the front and who is driving it at the rear, the stages where its\nriding animals would stop for rest and the final place of stay, and who among them would be\nkilled and who would die a natural death.\nWhen I am dead, hard circumstances and distressing events would befall you, many persons\nin the position of asking questions would remain silent with cast down eye, while those in the\nposition of replying would lose courage. This would be at a time when wars would descend\nupon you with all hardship and days would be so hard on you that you would feel them\nprolonged because of hardship till Allah would give victory to those remaining virtuous\namong you.\nWhen mischief come they confuse (right with wrong) and when they clear away they leave a\nwarning. They cannot be known at the time of approach but are recognised at the time of\nreturn. They blow like the blowing of winds, striking some cities and missing others.\nBeware that the worst mischief for you in my view is the mischief of Banu Umayyah, because\nit is blind and also creates darkness. Its sway is general but its ill effects are for particular\npeople. He who remains clear-sighted in it would be affected by distress, and he who remains\nblind in it would avoid the distress.\nBy Allah. you will find Banu Umayyah after me worst people for yourselves, like the old\nunruly she-camel who bites with its mouth, beats with its fore-legs, kicks with its hind legs\nand refuses to be milked.\nThey would remain over you till they would leave among you only those who benefit them or\nthose who do not harm them. Their calamity would continue till your seeking help from them\nwould become like the seeking of help by the slave from his master or of the follower from\nthe leader.\nTheir mischief would come to you like evil eyed fear and pre-Islamic fragments, wherein\nthere would be no minaret of guidance nor any sign (of salvation) to be seen.\nWe Ahlu'l-bayt (the Household of the Prophet) are free from this mischief and we are not\namong those who would engender it. Thereafter, Allah would dispel it from you like the\nremoval of the skin (from flesh) through him who would humble them, drag them by necks,\nmake them drink full cups (of hardships), not extend them anything but sword and not clothe\nthem save with fear.\nAt that time Quraysh would wish at the cost of the world and all its contents to find me even\nonly once and just for the duration of the slaughter of a camel in order that I may accept from\nthem (the whole of) that of which at present I am asking them only a part but they are not\ngiving me.\n(1). Amir al-mu'minin delivered this sermon after the battle of Nahrawan. In it, mischief imply\nthe battles fought in Basrah, Siffin and Nahrawan because their nature was different from the\nbattles of the Prophet. There the opposite party were the unbelievers while here the\nconfrontation was with those who had veils of Islam on their faces.\nSo people were hesitant to fight against Muslims, and asked why they should fight with those\nwho recited the call to the prayers and offered the prayers.
