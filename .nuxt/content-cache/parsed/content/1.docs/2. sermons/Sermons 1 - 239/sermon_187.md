He who illustrates Him does not signify Him. He who\npoints at Him and imagines Him does not mean Him. Everything that is known through itself\nhas been created, and everything that exists by virtue of other things is the effect (of a cause).\nHe works but not with the help of instruments. He fixes measures but not with the activity of\nthinking. He is rich but not by acquisition.\nTimes do not keep company with Him, and implements do not help Him. His Being precedes\ntimes. His Existence precedes non-existence and His eternity precedes beginning.\nBy His creating the senses it is known that He has no senses. By the contraries in various\nmatters it is known that He has no contrary, and by the similarity between things it is known\nthat there is nothing similar to Him. He has made light the contrary of darkness, brightness\nthat of gloom, dryness that of moisture and heat that of cold. He produces affection among\ninimical things.\nHe fuses together diverse things, brings near remote things and separates things which are\njoined together. He is not confined by limits, nor counted by numbers. Material parts can\nsurround things of their own kind, and organs can point out things similar to themselves. The\nword(1) \"mundhu\" (i.e. since) disproves their eternity, the word \"qad\" (that denotes nearness\nof time of occurrence), disproves their being from ever and the word \"lawla\" (if it were not)\nkeep them remote from perfection.\nThrough them the Creator manifests Himself to the intelligence, and through them He is\nguarded from the sight of the eyes.\nStillness and motion do not occur in Him, and how can that thing occur in Him which He has\nHimself made to occur, and how can a thing revert to Him which He first created, and how\ncan a thing appear in Him which He first brought to appearance. If it had not been so, His Self\nwould have become subject to diversity, His Being would have become divisible (into parts),\nand His reality would have been prevented from being deemed Eternal.\nIf there was a front to Him there would have been a rear also for Him . He would need\ncompleting only if shortage befell Him. In that case signs of the created would appear in Him,\nand He would become a sign (leading to other objects) instead of signs leading to Him.\nThrough the might of His abstention (from affectedness) He is far above being affected by\nthings which effect others.\nHe is that which does not change or vanish. The process of setting does not behove Him. He\nhas not begotten any one lest He be regarded as having been born. He has not been begotten\notherwise He would be contained within limits. He is too High to have sons. He is too\npurified to contact women. Imagination cannot reach Him so as to assign Him quantity.\nUnderstanding cannot think of Him so as to give him shape. Senses do not perceive Him so as\nto feel Him. Hands cannot touch Him so as to rub against Him. He does not change into any\ncondition. He does not pass from one state to another. Nights and days do not turn Him old.\nLight and darkness do not alter Him.\nIt cannot be said that He has a limit or extremity, or end or termination; nor do things control\nHim so as to raise Him or lower Him, nor does anything carry Him so as to bend Him or keep\nHim erect. He is not inside things nor outside them. He conveys news, but not with the tongue\nor voice. He listens, but not with the holes of the ears or the organs of hearing. He says, but\ndoes not utter words. He remembers, but does not memorise.\nHe determines, but not by exercising His mind. He loves and approves without any\nsentimentality (of heart). He hates and feels angry without any painstaking. When He intends\nto create someone He says \"Be\" and there he is, but not through a voice that strikes (the ears)\nis that call heard. His speech is an act of His creation. His like never existed before this. If had\nbeen eternal it would have been the second god.\nIt cannot be said that He came into being after He had not been in existence because in that\ncase the attributes of the created things would be assigned to Him and there would remain no\ndifference between them and Him, and He would have no distinction over them. Thus, the\nCreator and the created would become equal and the initiator and the initiated would be on\nthe same level. He created (the whole of) creation without any example made by someone\nelse, and He did not secure the assistance of any one out of His creation for creating it.\nHe created the earth and suspended it without being busy, retained it without support, made it\nstand without legs, raised it without pillars, protected it against bendings and curvings and\ndefended it against crumbling and splitting (into parts). He fixed mountains on it like stumps,\nsolidified its rocks, caused its streams to flow and opened wide its valleys.\nWhatever He made did not suffer from any flow, and whatever He strengthened did not show\nany weakness.\nHe manifests Himself over the earth with His authority and greatness. He is aware of its\ninside through his knowledge and understanding. He has power over every thing in the earth\nby virtue of His sublimity and dignity. Nothing from the earth that he may ask for defies Him,\nnor does it oppose Him so as to overpower Him.\nNo swift-footed creature can run away from Him so as to surpass Him. He is not needy\ntowards any possessing person so that he should feed Him. All things bow to Him and are\nhumble before His greatness. They cannot flee away from His authority to someone else in\norder to escape His benefit or His harm. There is no parallel for Him who may match Him\nand no one like Him so as to equal Him.\nHe will destroy the earth after its existence, till all that exists on it will become non-existent.\nBut the extinction of the world after its creation is no stranger than its first formation and\ninvention. How could it be? Even if all the animals of the earth, whether birds or beasts,\nstabled cattle or pasturing ones, of different origins and species, dull people and sagacious\nmen -- all jointly try to create (even) a mosquito they are not able to bring it into being and do\nnot understand what is the way to its creation. Their wits are bewildered and wandering.\nTheir powers fall short and fail, and return disappointed and tired, knowing that they are\ndefeated and admitting their inability to produce it, also realising that they are too weak\n(even) to destroy it.\nSurely, after the extinction of the world, Allah the Glorified will remain alone with nothing\nelse beside Him. He will be, after its extinction, as He was before its production: without time\nor place or moment or period. At this moment, period and time will not exist, and years and\nhours will disappear. There will be nothing except Allah, the One, the All-powerful.\nTo Him is the return of all matters. Its initial creation was not in its power; and the prevention\nof its extinction was (also) not in its power.\nIf it had the power to prevent it, it would have existed for ever. When He made anything of\nthe world, the making of it did not cause Him any difficulty, and the creation of anything\nwhich He created and formed did not fatigue Him. He did not create it to heighten His\nauthority nor for fear of loss or harm, nor to seek its help against an overwhelming foe, nor to\nguard against any avenging opponent with its help, nor for the extension of His domain by its\nhelp, nor for boasting (over largeness of His possession) against a partner, nor because He felt\nlonely and desired to seek its company.\nThen after its creation He will destroy it, but not because any worry has overcome Him in its\nupkeep and administration, nor for any pleasure that will accrue to Him, nor for the\ncumbrousness of anything over Him. The length of its life does not weary Him so as to induce\nHim to its quick destruction. But Allah, the Glorified, has maintained it with His kindness,\nkept it intact with His command and perfected it with His power.\nThen after its destruction, He will resuscitate it, but not for any need of His own towards it,\nnor to seek the assistance of any of its things against it, nor to change over from the condition\nof loneliness to that of company, nor from the condition of ignorance and blindness to that of\nknowledge and search, nor from paucity and need towards needlessness and plenty, nor from\ndisgrace and lowliness towards honour and prestige.\n(1). The meaning is that the sense for which the words \"mundhu\" , \"qad\" and \"lawla\" have\nbeen formed is opposed to the attributes of \"Ever\", \"Eternal\" and \"Perfect\". Therefore, their\napplication to anything would prove that they have come into existence from non-existence\nand are imperfect. For example, \"mundhu\" is used to denote time as is \"qad wujida mundu\nkadha\" (this thing is found since so-and-so).\nHere a time limit has been stated, and anything for which a limit of time can be described\ncannot exist from ever or for ever. The word \"qad\" shows (indicating the present perfect tense)\nthe immediate past. This sense also can apply to a thing which is limited in time. The word\n\"lawla\" is used to denote the negation of something in another thing, as \"ma ahsanahu wa\nakmalahu lawla annahu kadha\" (how handsome and perfect it would be if it were so-and-so).\nTherefore, the thing for which this word is used would be in need of others in handsomeness\nand perfection, and would remain deficient by itself."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:2. sermons:Sermons 1 - 239:sermon_187.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/2. sermons/Sermons 1 - 239/sermon_187.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"32ojEgx7FW"}
