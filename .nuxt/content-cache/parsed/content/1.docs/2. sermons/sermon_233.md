By origins of\na thing are meant those things on which its coming into existence\ndepends, but they should not be its cause. The word \"tin\" is the\nplural of \"tinah\" which means origin or basis. Here \"tinah\"\nmeans semen which after passing through various stages of\ndevelopment emerges in the human shape. Its origin means those\nconstituents from which those items are created which help in the\nformation of semen. Thus, by saltish, sweet, soft or hard soil the\nreference is to these elementary constituents.

The reason for calling them \"origins of\ntinah\" is that they serve as an asylum for the human body and\nprevent the elements from diffusion. Just as the existence of a\nthing hinges on its basis, in the same way the existence of this\nbody which is made up of elements depends on preservative factors.\nSo long as the preservative factor exists the body is also safe from\ndisruption and disintegration and the elements too are immune to\ndiffusion and dispersal. When it leaves the body the elements also\nget dispersed."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAccording to this explanation Amir al-mu'minin's words would mean\nthat Allah has created different original factors among whom some\nare vicious and some are virtuous, some are weak and some are\nstrong, and every person will act according to his original factor.\nIf there is similarity in the inclinations of two persons it is\nbecause their original factor are similar, and if their tendencies\ndiffer it is because their original factors do not have any\nsimilarity.
