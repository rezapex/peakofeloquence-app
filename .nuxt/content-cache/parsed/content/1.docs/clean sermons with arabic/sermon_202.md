In this connection, the first scene\nthat strikes the eyes is that arrangements for the funeral rites of\nthe Prophet had not yet been made when the contest for power started\nin the Saqifah of Banu Sa`idah. Naturally, their leaving the body\nof the Prophet (without burial) must have injured\nSayyidatu'n-nisa' Fatimah's grief-stricken heart when she saw\nthat those who had claimed love and attachment (with the Prophet)\nduring his life became so engrossed in their machinations for power\nthat instead of consoling his only daughter they did not even know\nwhen the Prophet was given a funeral ablution and when he was\nburied, and the way they condoled her was that they crowded at her\nhouse with material to set fire to it and tried to secure allegiance\nby force with all the display of oppression, compulsion and\nviolence. All these excesses were with a view to so obliterate the\nprestigious position of this house that it might not regain its lost\nprestige on any occasion. With this aim in view, in order to crush\nher economic position, her claim for (the estate of) Fadak was\nturned down by dubbing it as false, the effect of which was that\nSayyidatu'n-nisa' Fatimah (p.b.u.h.) made the dying will that none\nof them should attend her funeral.]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-202","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 202"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.docs:clean sermons with arabic:sermon_202.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.docs/clean sermons with arabic/sermon_202.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"aCayPr6nMz"}
