They would\neat only if a casual traveller or the inhabitant of nearby dwellings\ngave them anything to eat, otherwise they remained contented with\nthe fruits of wild trees and the water of the streams, and thus they\npassed their life. This way of worship commenced in a way that was\nforced by the oppression and hardships of rulers. Certain people\nleft their houses and, in order to avoid their grip, hid themselves\nin some wilderness or cave in a mountain, engaging themselves in\nworship of and devotion to Allah. Later on, this forced asceticism\nacquired a voluntary form and people began to retire to caves and\nhollows of their own volition. Thus it became an accepted way that\nwhoever aimed at spiritual development retired to some corner after\nsevering himself from all worldly ties.

The conception of worship in Islam is not confined to a\nfew particular rites, but it regards the earning of one's\nlivelihood through lawful means, mutual sympathy and good behaviour,\nand co-operation and assistance also to be important constituents of\nworship. If an individual ignores worldly rights and obligations and\ndoes not fulfil his responsibility towards his wife and children,\nnor occupies himself in efforts to earn a livelihood, but all the\ntime stays in meditation, he ruins his life and does not fulfil the\npurpose of living.

Since\nAllah has created man in this world he should follow the code of\nlife for living in this world, and should partake of the comforts\nand pleasures bestowed by Allah within moderate limits. The eating\nand using of things made lawful by Allah is not against Allah's\nworship, but rather Allah has created these things for the very\npurpose that they should be taken advantage of. That is why those\nwho were the chosen of Allah lived in this world with others and ate\nand drank like others. They did not feel the need to turn their\nfaces away from the people of the world, and to adopt the wilderness\nor the caves of mountains as their abodes, or to live in distant\nspots.

That is why religious law accords a greater\nposition to the worship performed by a family man than that by a\nnon-family man, because the former can exercise mental peace and\nconcentration in the worship and rituals."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIndividuals who put on the cloak of Sufism and make a loud show of\ntheir spiritual greatness are cut off from the path of Islam and are\nignorant of its wide teachings. They have been misled by Satan and,\nrelying on their self-formed conceptions, tread wrongful paths.\nEventually their misguidance becomes so serious that they begin to\nregard their leaders as having attained such a level that their word\nis as the word of Allah and their act is as the act of Allah.\nSometimes they regard themselves beyond all the bounds and\nlimitations of religious law and consider every evil act to be\nlawful for them. This deviation from faith and irreligiousness is\nnamed Sufism (complete devotion to Allah). Its unlawful principles\nare called \"at-tariqah\" (ways of achieving communion with Allah)\nand the followers of this cult are known as Sufis. First of all Abu\nHashim al-Kufi and Shami adopted this nickname. He was of Umayyad\ndescent and a fatalist (believing that man is bound to act as\npre-ordained by Allah). The reason for giving him this name was\nthat, in order to make a show of his asceticism and fear for Allah,\nhe put on a woollen cloak. Later on this nickname became common and\nvarious grounds were put forth as the basis of this name. For\nexample, one ground is that 'Sufi' has three letters, \"sad\",\n\"waw\" and \"fa'\". \"sad\" stands for \"sabr\" (endurance),\n\"sidq\" (truthfulness) and \"safa\" (purity of heart); \"waw\"\nstands for \"wudd\" (love), \"wird\" (repeating Allah's name) and\n\"wafa'\" (faithfulness to Allah), and \"fa'\" stands for \"fard\"\n(unity), \"faqr\" (destitution) and \"fana'\" (death or absorption\nin Allah's Self). The second view is that it has been derived from\n\"as-Suffah\", which was a platform near the Prophet's mosque which\nhad a covering of date-palm leaves. Those who stayed there were\ncalled Ashabu'Suffah (people of the platform). The third view is\nthat the name of the progenitor of an Arab tribe was Sufah, and this\ntribe performed the duties of serving the pilgrims and the Ka`bah,\nand it is with reference to their connection with this tribe that\nthese people were called Sufis. This group is divided among various\nsects but the basic sects are seven only.\\\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ol","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"al-Wahdatiyyah (unitarian):"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThis sect believes in the oneness of all existence.
