You should not consider the achievements of the\npleasures of life or opportunities of revenge for wrongs done to you as the main blessings\nbestowed upon you but you must feel happy for good deeds that you have provided for the\nHereafter.\nYou must feel sorry for the wealth that you have left without spending it on good causes and\nthe opportunities you have lost of doing noble and pious deeds.
