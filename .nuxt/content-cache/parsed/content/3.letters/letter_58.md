One who does not care for his salvation, will never think of providing for his life\nafter death with good deeds and, therefore, he will not be able to escape the punishment.\nBe it known to you that the responsibilities laid down upon you are a few but the Divine\nreward reserved for you is very high. Allah has forbidden you from tyranny and injustice; and\neven if there had not been any fear of punishment for these inequities, the mere reward of\nbeing just, kind and human would have been such that there could not have been any excuse\nfor not trying to achieve it.\nTreat the tax-payers with equity and justice and think over their wishes with patience and\nkindness because you are the treasurer of the subjects, representative of the people and the\nofficer on behalf of higher authority. Do not force anybody to forsake his requirements and to\ndo without his necessities (so that he may pay the taxes).\nIn collection of taxes and revenues do not sell their winter and summer clothing, their slaves\nor such of their animals as are of service to them, do not resort to whipping, do not touch their\nproperty, be they Muslims or non-Muslims, but if you find there armaments or weapons or\nhorses of the non-Muslims for which there is a danger and a possibility of these being used in\nwar against the State, you may confiscate them.\nSuch things as are dangerous to the safety of the country should not be left in the possession\nof unreliable persons so that they should not prove harmful and injurious to the Muslim State\nand its people.\nBe kind to the people, treat the army well, do not grudge to do your best in helping the\nsubjects and in guarding the religion.\nThese two duties are obligations laid down upon you by Allah because, in return to the\nBlessings and Bounties which He has granted us, He wants you and me to be thankful to Him\nas much as we can, and to help His cause to the best of our ability. You must remember that\neven our strength and capabilities are His Blessings granted to us.\n,. .,. ,.\n,. .,. ,.\n,. .,. ,."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_58.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_58.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"9c0REKEOHi"}
