Let the eternal Reward and Blessings of Allah be the prompting factors for\nall that you say and do. Be an enemy of tyrants and oppressors and be a friend and helper of\nthose who are oppressed and tyrannized.\nTo you, to my other children, to my relatives and to all who acquire this will of mine, I advise\nto fear Allah and to be pious, to have fair and honest dealings with one another and improve\nmutual relations because I have heard your grandfather, the Holy Prophet (s) saying, \"To\nremove mutual enmity, ill-feeling and hatred is better than recommended prayers and fasting\".\nFear Allah when the question of helpless orphans arises. You should never let them starve. So\nlong as you are there to guard and protect them they should not be ruined or lost. The Holy\nProphet (s) had always advised, cautioned and reminded us of this responsibility, so much so\nthat we often thought that the Prophet of Allah (s) might on the next occasion assign them a\nshare from our heritage.\nFear Allah in respect of the Holy Qur'an, lest others should excel and surpass you in\nfollowing its tenets and in acting according to its orders. Fear Allah so far as prayers are\nconcerned because prayers are pillars of your faith. Fear Allah in the matter of His Holy\nHouse (Kaa'ba). Let it not be deserted because if it is deserted, you (the Muslims) will be lost.\nDo not forget Allah, struggle in His cause with your tongue, with your wealth and with your\nlives.\nDevelop mutual liking, friendship and love and help one another. Take care that you do not\nspurn and treat one another badly and unsympathetically.\nExhort people to do good and abstain them from evil, otherwise the vicious and the wicked\nwill be your overlord and if you willingly allow such persons to be your rulers then your\nprayers will not be heard by Allah.\nO' sons of Abdul Muttalib! Let there be no retaliation for the act of my murder, do not roam\nabout with a drawn sword and with the slogan: \"Amir al-Mu'minin is killed\", and do not start\nthe massacre of my opponents and enemies.\nSee to it that only one man, that is my assassin, is killed, as the punishment of the crime of\nmurder is death and nobody else is molested. The punishment to the man who attempted the\nmurder shall take place only when I die of the wound delivered by him and this punishment\nshall be only one stroke of sword to end his life. He should not be tortured before his death,\nhis hands and feet should not be amputated because I have heard the Holy Prophet (s) saying:\n\"Do not amputate hands and feet of anybody, be it a biting dog\"."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_54.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_54.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"i9RpYBxF1h"}
