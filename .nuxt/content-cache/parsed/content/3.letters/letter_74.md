The reason was that we accepted and preached Islam and you remained heathen. The\ncondition now is that we are faithful and staunch followers of Islam and you have revolted\nagainst it. Even your original acceptance was not sincere, it was simple hypocrisy. When you\nsaw that all the big people of Arabia had embraced Islam and had gathered under the banner\nof the Holy Prophet (s) you also walked in (after the Fall of Makkah.)\nIn your letter you have falsely accused me of killing Talha and Zubayr, driving Ummul\nMu'minin Aisha from her home at Madina and choosing Kufa and Basra as my residence.\nEven if all that you say against me is correct you have nothing to do with them, you are not\nharmed by these incidents and I have not to apologize to you for any of them.\nYou have threatened that you are coming out to fight against me with a large horde of\nMuhajirs and Ansar. Do tell me who these Muhajirs are? The door of Hegira (Migration of\nMuslims to save their lives from the hands of unbelievers of Quraysh) was already closed on\nthe day your elder brother, Yazid bin Abi Sufyan was taken prisoner and Makkah was\nsurrendered by your father and the process of migration had ceased as soon as your paganism\nceased. (The Holy Prophet (s) had said that there would be no Hegira after the victory of\nMakkah).\nAre you so anxious for a battle? Wait! You may get it to your heart's content. I may come out\nmyself to meet you which will be a correct gesture on my part because Allah may have\ndestined me to punish you for your inequities. And if you take the initiative to come out to\nfight, then it would mean, as a poet of Bani Asad has said \"They are facing those furious\nsummer winds which shower sand, rubble and gravel-stones\". Remember that I still hold the\nsword which has sent your maternal grandfather, maternal uncle and your brother to the same\nresting-place, the Hell.\nBy Allah, I know you too well to argue with you or to advise you. Apostasy and\navariciousness have taken a firm hold of your mind, your intelligence is of inferior order and\nyou cannot differentiate what in the end is good for you and what is not.\nIt is correct to say about you that you have risen to such dangerous and sinful heights that\nyour fall which is inevitable will lead to an eternal damnation because you are coveting a\nthing which morally does not belong to you and for which you are religiously most unsuitable\nand with which you have neither sincere affection nor any affinity or propensity. It had been\nonce usurped from the right person and you now want to retain it for yourself.\nHow great is the difference between your words and deeds? How much you resemble your\nmaternal and paternal uncles, whose ill-luck persuaded them to deny and repudiate the Holy\nProphet (s) and to fight against him and everyone of whom was at last doomed to die. You\nknow very well that they could not protect themselves or protect the cause they were\nchallenging to men who were energetic and brave and were present in every battlefield to\ndefend the cause of Islam.\nYou have also written so much about the murderers of Caliph Uthman. The correct thing for\nyou to do is to take the oath of allegiance to me as others have done and present the case in\nmy court of justice and then I shall pass my judgement according to the tenets of the Holy\nQur'an. But what you are desiring now is a deceit usually played upon babies when they are to\nbe checked from breast feeding.\nMay the Peace of Allah be upon those who deserve it."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_74.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_74.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"iSNT6Fqyh6"}
