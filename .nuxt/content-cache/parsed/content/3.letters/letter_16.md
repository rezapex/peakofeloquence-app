title: Letter 16
description: Whenever Imam Ali (a) faced an enemy he invoked Allah in the following words.
---

O Lord! Our hearts seek Your Protection, our faces turn to You, our eyes look towards You, 
our feet move towards Your path and our bodies sincerely submit to Your command. O Lord! 
Hidden hostilities and concealed spite are exposed, hearts are boiling over with envy and 
malice. O Lord! We place before You our difficulties, the absence of the Holy Prophet (s) 
from amongst us, the abundance of enemies, the disappointments and frustrations which face 
us. O Lord! Let truth prevail and let our people realize justice, honesty and piety of our case.
