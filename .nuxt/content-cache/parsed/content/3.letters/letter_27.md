It instructs (his heirs) how to\nspend his property only to gain the Blessings of Allah so that Allah may grant him peace and\nallow him to enter His Paradise. After me my son Hasan (a) will be the administrator,\nexecutor and testator of my property. He can spend it according to the laws of Islam in\nhelping the poor, destitute and the needy in accordance with the canons ordained by Allah. If\nanything happens to Hasan (a) and Husayn (a) is alive after him, then he will be the next\nexecutor and testator and should act according to the spirit of the instructions given herein.\nVerily, for the two sons of Fatima (a), Hasan and Husayn (a), the share out of my property is\nequal to the shares of my other sons (being Imams they should not be barred from taking their\nshare and at the same time their share cannot be more on account of their being administrators\nand executors). I have appointed sons of Fatima (a) executors to please Allah and out of\nrespect and love that I bear towards the Holy Prophet (a) and his daughter (peace of Allah be\nupon them and their descendants).\nI order the executor to keep this property as it is and to spend the income on the poor and\ndestitute as desired by me. I further order that young date-palm of the estate not to be cut until\nit is fully afforested with date-palm and take up the shape of a well-developed palm-orchard.\nMy widows are to be treated with respect and their shares, out of this property, are to be\nincluded in the shares of their sons and even if any of them loses her son she will still enjoy\nher share, she should not be left unhelped to work like a slave-woman for her living."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_27.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_27.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"e8Fv8i6YEm"}
