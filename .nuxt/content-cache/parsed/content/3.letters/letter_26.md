Do not waste the knowledge given to you\nby the Holy Prophet (s) and do not give up and destroy his Sunnah (traditions).\nKeep these two pillars of Islam (monotheism and Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (s)) aloft. If you\nact according to my advice then you cannot be blamed for damaging or destroying the\nreligion.\nUntil yesterday I was your Amir, today I am only an object from whom you can take lesson\nand warnings, and tomorrow I shall part company with you. If I survive this fatal wound I\nshall be at liberty to decide how to treat the man who attempted to kill me. If I die then my\nworldly life comes to an end. If I forgive my assassin then it will be to gain the Blessings of\nAllah for forgiving a person who has harmed you, and it will be a good deed if you also\nforgive him.\nDo you not desire to be forgiven by the Lord? I swear by Allah that death is not coming to me\nsuddenly and unexpectedly that I may hate or abhor, neither is it such a visitor whom I may\nrefuse to meet. So far as death by martyrdom is concerned I always expected and desired it\nand I now welcome it like a thirsty person who finds water when he is extremely thirsty. I am\na seeker whom martyrdom finds what he was seeking for. To the pious people the best is that\nwhich they find with Allah."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_26.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_26.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"Kp0yRdqeAw"}
