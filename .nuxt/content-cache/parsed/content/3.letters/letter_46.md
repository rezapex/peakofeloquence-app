description: A letter to Amr bin Aas.

Undoubtedly you have subordinated your religion to the worldly power, pomp and wealth 
provided to you by a person whose apostation and scepticism are not hidden from anybody. 
He and his ways are known to everybody. He sullies the reputation as well as the character of 
those who keep company with him. He tries to deceive sober and sedate people. For the sake 
of remnants and crumbs of bread left over at his table, you have attached yourself to him. You 
are following him like a dog which follows a tiger, frightfully looks at its paws and waits to 
live upon the refuse which it leaves of its kill. 
In this way you have lost your self-respect and honour in this world and your salvation in the 
next. You have ruined your present and future. Had you followed the true path, you would 
have secured success in this world as well as in the Hereafter.
