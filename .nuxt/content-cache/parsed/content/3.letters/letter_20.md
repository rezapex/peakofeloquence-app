description: who defended, guarded and suffered so much for the Holy Prophet (s) and Islam
---



What is more, no freed-slave can be considered equal to a Muhajir and one coming from a 
doubtful lineage cannot claim to be equal to those who come from the noble parentage while 
there is no similarity between one who follows truth and Islam and one who doubts the truth 
of Islam. Remember also that the worst descendant is one who follows in the footstep of his 
ancestor in the way of paganism, hypocrisy and Hell. 
We (Bani Hashim) still own the glory of prophethood (having the Holy Prophet (s) from 
amongst us). Prophethood which brought equality to mankind by lowering the position of 
mighty and despotic lords and raising the status of oppressed and humiliated persons. When 
Allah willed the Arabs to embrace Islam, in large numbers they entered its fold willingly or 
reluctantly. 
During the days when those who had precedence in embracing Islam were receiving the 
Blessings of the Lord for this precedence or when those who, on account of unbearable 
sufferings from the hands of your clan, were forced to migrate from Makkah, you and your 
family were after wealth and power. 
Some of you embraced Islam to better your position because Muslims were gaining 
ascendancy and supremacy and some others became Muslims because after having harmed 
and wronged the Muslims in the early days of Islam, you felt that the only way to protect 
yourself from their vengeance was to profess their religion, though outwardly and 
hypocritically. 
Fear Allah and do not let Satan influence your mind and body and do not give it a way into 
your soul.
