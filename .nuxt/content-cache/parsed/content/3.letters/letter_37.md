Deeply deliberate over the duties that Allah has laid down upon you, each one of\nthem is His due which should be respectfully rendered. Try to learn and understand that for\nwhich you have no right to plead ignorance.\nRemember that there are clear modes, honest means, bright ways, rational procedures,\nsensible manners, pious methods of faithfully carrying out His orders and obeying His\ncommands and there are innumerable gains and unlimited advantages in that way of life. Wise\npeople adopt those ways and follow them but only fools refuse to accept His advice. Whoever\nturns away from Allah actually turns away from the realities of life and dictates of wisdom\nand, therefore, he wanders in the wilderness of ignorance.\nThe Almighty Allah will take away His Blessings from him and will send His Wrath upon\nhim.\nFor the sake of yourself be afraid of self-aggrandizement, self-glorification and selfishness.\nThe Merciful Allah has shown you the correct way of leading an honest and a virtuous life\nand has clearly pointed to you the place where life and its activities are going to end.\nBeware that your vicious desire of gaining everything for yourself has landed you in a maze\nof wickedness and crime, it has forcefully driven you to the folds of vices and sins, it has\nmade it easy for you to achieve your eternal damnation and has rendered it impossible for you\nto follow the path of virtue and to attain salvation."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_37.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_37.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"5ZBOuASpD7"}
