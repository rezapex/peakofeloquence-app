This is the treaty which has been agreed upon by the Yemenite people, be they urban or rural 
and pastoral and the people of the Bani Rabi'a tribe, be they dwellers of cities or those living 
in villages or desert. 
Through this treaty both the parties have agreed that they will steadfastly adhere to their faith 
in the Holy Book, will accept its orders and tenets, will invite people towards it and will pass 
verdicts according to its teachings and rulings that they will accept the call of those who 
invite them towards this Book and will accept the judgement passed according to it that they 
will not accept anything in lieu of this Book and will not sell it at any cost, that they will 
forsake those who forsake this Book and that they will unite to fight against those who go 
against this Book. 
They promise to help each other and to speak with a common voice on affairs of mutual 
interest. 
They will not break this agreement on account of excitement or anger of any person or 
because one participant considers the other humble, weak or powerless, or because one group 
speaks disparagingly of the other. 
Every member of the covenanting party whether present or absent, whether educated or 
illiterate, wise or ignorant, will stand by this agreement faithfully. 
Over and above the terms of this covenant is the promise of its observance which they have 
made to Allah and for which they will be held responsible.
