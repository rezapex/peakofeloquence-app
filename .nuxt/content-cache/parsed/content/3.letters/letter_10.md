description: A letter to Mu'awiya.

Have you ever seriously considered what would happen to you if all your wealth and property 
is taken away from you. The possessions, the riches and the luxuries that you have surrounded 
yourself with, belong to this world, a world which has profusely decorated itself and which is 
bent upon alluring you with its enjoyments. It has enticed you away and you have fallen an 
easy prey to its allurements. It has dragged you and you have followed it like a tame animal 
on the other end of the rope. It has ordered you and you have obeyed its orders submissively. 
You have forgotten that shortly you will be called to bear the consequences of such a life; 
consequences from which no one can shield, liberate or absolve you. 
Abstain from such a life, keep yourself ready for the Day of Judgement; be ready for death 
which is inevitable, bound to come and sure to end every life, rich or poor. Do not listen to 
the exciting whispers of those who want to tempt you and do not make them believe that they 
and their heinous whisperings have any importance in your mind. 
If you do not faithfully and sincerely follow the dictates of religion and do not act as I have 
advised you, then I want to warn you of something that you have entirely forgotten. It is that 
you are unthankful to Allah for all which He has granted to you and you are ungrateful to 
Him for the Favours bestowed upon you. Satan has taken possession of your soul. Its desire to 
secure you as his obedient slave, is fully fulfilled. It has a firm hold on your mind. 
O Mu'awiya! Were you ever entrusted with the noble status of dispensing peace and justice to 
mankind? Have you the necessary knowledge for the work? Do you really know the canons of 
equity and justice as laid down by Islam? You and your ways of government! May Allah 
protect me from and may withhold me from behaving towards mankind the way you have 
behaved and from tyranny, exploitations and murders that you commit. Take care! You are 
being madly driven by the lust of wealth, power and vicious indulgence, you are behaving 
hypocritically against man and Allah. You shall be damned forever. 
You have challenged me to a battle. I accept your challenge. But I have a proposal to make. 
Why have a war involving murder and bloodshed of thousands of ignorant people? Why be a 
scourge to mankind? Let us have mercy on them, whether they are sincere and Allah-fearing 
Muslims, or ignorant, unenlightened and greedy mercenaries misguided and fooled by you. 
Let there be peace and tranquillity for all the creatures of Allah. 
Let us, you and I, have a single combat. Let it be a combat unto death. Let the soldiers of both 
armies stand aside and let two of us alone combat with each other. Let the world see and 
realize who is the sinner and who has forgotten Allah and the Day of Judgement. Will you 
accept this invitation of mine? Have you the courage for it? Are you a man to face death 
boldly and bravely or are you merely a vampire sucking the blood of others surreptitiously? 
Remember Mu'awiya! Though now old I am still Abu al-Hasan, the man who killed your 
maternal grandfather, your uncle and your brother in single combats in the Battle of Badr. The 
same sword is still in my hand, the same blood is still flowing in my veins, the same heart is 
still throbbing in my chest and with the same courage I still face my enemy. Will you come 
and face me alone? 
Remember that I have not introduced any innovation in religion, nor have I insinuated schism. 
Verily, I sincerely believe in the religion which you pretended to embrace hypocritically with 
mental reservations and pretensions, a religion which you in your heart of hearts actually 
hated and which you gave up quickly and cheerfully. 
You pretend that you want to avenge the murder of Caliph Uthman. Do you know who 
actually killed him and who caused his murder? If really you do so, then seek vengeance on 
them. 
I see before me the day when you will be tired of this war, when you will face defeat, when 
you will find death or disgrace facing you, when I shall scatter your armies, killing your 
famous but misguided marshals, when I shall thin your ranks and files; then in despondency 
and despair you will turn towards the Book of Allah, though you will have no faith in it and 
no belief in the truth preached by it because you and your followers being hypocrites have no 
faith in Allah, in the Holy Prophet (s) and the Day of Judgement and who have gone back on 
their promises.
