description: Imam Ali (a) wrote this letter to Salman al-Farsi, before his caliphate.

This world is like serpent - so soft to touch yet so lethal in its bite. Therefore, try to avoid 
those things of this place which please you or allure you because this world will be with you 
for a very short time and will be of very little use to you. Do not keep your mind fully 
engrossed in mundane affairs because you know for certain that you will shortly leave this 
world. 
Be most wary and cautious of this vicious world at times when it allures and pleases you the 
most because it is an old trick of this world that when a man is most happy with pleasure of 
owning and possessing it, it suddenly deserts him and when a man is most confident of its 
protection, help and love, it certainly forsakes him.
