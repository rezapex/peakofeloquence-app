. 
Then you have tried to frighten me by saying that there is nothing with you for me and my 
companions but your sword. Well, Mu'awiya! You made the people laugh at your words, they 
were feeling very sad and depressed at the standard of mental depravity exhibited by you. 
When did you find the sons of Abdul Muttalib (the grandfather of the Holy Prophet (s) and 
Imam Ali (a)) timid in facing their enemies or getting afraid of brandishing swords? 
Just wait a little, you will in the near future have to face the attack of a brave soldier. He will 
shortly invite you for the encounter you are desiring for. The thing which you apparently wish 
for is not as far away as you imagine it to be. I am coming towards you with an army of 
Muhajirs, Ansar and those companions who have sincere faith in me. Theirs is a powerful 
congregation. Their movements will raise huge clouds of dust (indicating the strength of the 
army). They are prepared to die or to kill. They believe that the best that could happen to the 
is to receive the Blessings of the Lord by their good deeds. Sons of those warriors who routed 
your clan in the Battle of Badr is with them. 
The swords of Bani Hashim are with them. And you have already realized the sharpness of 
these swords when your brother, your maternal uncle, your grandfather and kinsmen were 
killed (those people were killed by Imam Ali (a) in the battles of Badr and Uhud). These 
swords are now nearing the despots who have tyrannized the Muslim world.
