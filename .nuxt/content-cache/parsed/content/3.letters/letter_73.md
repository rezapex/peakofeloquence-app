If you are convinced that I am on the right side, then you must\ncome to my help and if you feel uncertain, nervous or timid, then get you gone.\nI swear by Allah that I shall not let you waver or adopt a double-cross policy. I shall not allow\nyou to sit peacefully at home with a double face, one for each party and I shall expose you to\nthe people. You will find yourself under suspicion from either group and you will be forced to\ndeclare your true inclinations.\nThis revolt which has made Basra as its Headquarters is not an easy joke as you have\nimagined it to be. It is a great tragedy and it shall have very far-reaching effects. It has to be\nfaced with the calamities which accompany it or which will follow it. It will have to be fought\nand to get the better of. Therefore, I advise you to think carefully, control your weak and\nwavering mind and face your lot bravely.\nAnd if you are not satisfied with me or have no faith in me then you can with complete\nfreedom go to the other side.\nYou have my unreserved permission. But I am sure you will not be welcomed there.\nAnd if you remain in my camp I shall not allow you to enjoy a restful sleep when Islam itself\nis in troubles and at war with the rebels. I swear by Allah that this decision of mine is the right\nstep of a faithful Muslim in the right direction."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_73.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_73.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"Xt7cdWfYYE"}
