I must\ninform you that verily, those, who were killed defending the truth and Islam were martyrs,\nand they are in Paradise and those who were killed helping paganism or hypocrisy, are now in\nHell. But the contention that your position in wars is the same as mine, is very fantastic and\nludicrous.\nThe absurdity of your claim is due to the fact that you want to match your doubt and\nincredulity in the truth of Islam to my sincere belief and faith in it, this you cannot do. Further\nthe Syrians are as keen for these worldly gains as Iraqis are to achieve the favour of Allah and\nthe Holy Prophet (s)"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_18.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_18.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"rkkVjY926T"}
