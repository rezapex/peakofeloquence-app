You want me to give Syria over to you but remember that what I have previously refused you 
cannot be handed over to you and I will never consent to your usurpation of the same. 
You tell me that wars have annihilated the Arabs and very few people are left alive. I must 
inform you that verily, those, who were killed defending the truth and Islam were martyrs, 
and they are in Paradise and those who were killed helping paganism or hypocrisy, are now in 
Hell. But the contention that your position in wars is the same as mine, is very fantastic and 
ludicrous. 
The absurdity of your claim is due to the fact that you want to match your doubt and 
incredulity in the truth of Islam to my sincere belief and faith in it, this you cannot do. Further 
the Syrians are as keen for these worldly gains as Iraqis are to achieve the favour of Allah and 
the Holy Prophet (s)
