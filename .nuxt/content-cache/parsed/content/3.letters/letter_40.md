They are trying to reach the path of religion through wrong ways and to\nacquire worldly wealth and pleasure under the pretence of religious activities.\nNot only this but they are also trying in various ways to persuade noble and pious persons to\nsell their salvation to the possession of pleasures of this life. They are serving their vicious\nruler by sinning against Allah and man.\nRemember that Divine Reward is for those who earn it with their sincere and good deeds and\npunishment is the lot of men who deserve it by their evil activities. Therefore, you should\ncarry on your duties like an experienced, wise and faithful officer, like an officer who obeys\nhis ruler, guards his interest and keeps himself well-informed of the affairs of the State.\nDo not act in a way that you may in future feel sorry for your actions and may have to offer\nexcuses and apologies. Do not get arrogant when times prove favourable to you and do not\nshow weakness when your duties require you to be strong and resolute."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_40.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_40.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"bpFx5QptwA"}
