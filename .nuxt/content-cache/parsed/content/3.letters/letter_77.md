Hold meetings and audiences\n(during these days) in the mornings and evenings. Give proper answers and guidance to those\nwho ask questions about religion and religious observances and functions.\nEducate those who are ignorant. Hold discussions and exchange views with educated and\nlearned people. None should carry your message to the people but your tongue and let none\ncome between you and those who want to approach you (not even a door-keeper or a guard).\nDo not let the deserving and needy people go from you with empty hands, if they come to ask\nfavour of you. Remember that if you once send away a really needy person with a curt\nrefusal, and if you grant the favour on his second approach, you will not get the credit of\nbeing sympathetic and generous to him.\nBeware of the Public Treasury.\nSpend its money on the poor people of your province. Find them out (if they do not come to\nyou) and meet their necessities.\nIf any surplus amount is left over after such expenditure then send the amount to the centre so\nthat it may meet the requirements of the poor throughout the State.\nOrder the citizens of Makkah not to charge rent of the quarters they give to the pilgrims\nbecause Allah has decreed that in this Holy City the permanent residents and the pilgrims\nhave equal status and rights. May Allah enable us to do the things which He approves and\nlikes."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_77.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_77.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"mncLxpe6q1"}
