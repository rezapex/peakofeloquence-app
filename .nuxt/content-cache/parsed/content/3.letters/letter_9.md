description: A letter to Mu'awiya.

Quraysh was our tribe, but they wanted to kill the Holy Prophet (s) and to exterminate our 
family. They conspired against us and made plots after plots to harm us. 
They tried their best to frighten and injure us. They forced us to leave our homes and to retire 
to the cave of Shi'b Abi Taalib. It was a very rough and hard place to live in, and we were 
forced to lead a very harsh life. Their instigated their tribe as well as other clans to fight 
against us. The Merciful Allah came to our help. He protected and defended us. 
From amongst us those who had faith in the Holy Prophet (s) and Islam stood up to defend 
him and his cause; their desire was to achieve the favour of the Lord; and those of Bani 
Hashim who had not embraced Islam as yet like Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib also came to our 
help because we belonged to them and they to us. From amongst the Quraysh, the condition 
of those who had embraced Islam, was not as bad as ours. 
Either they had defensive alliance with the non-believers or some tribes decided to defend 
them despite their differences in religion. While it was the practice of the Holy Prophet (s) 
that whenever a battle was raged and his companions behaved cowardly or ran away from the 
battlefield (as in Badr, Uhud and Hunayn) which was usually the case or started making the 
Muslims nervous (as in Khandaq), he sent members of his family (Bani Hashim) to fight out 
the battle to protect his companions. 
These members of Bani Hashim often fought single handed and some even met martyrdom as 
for instance, Ubayda bin Haarith was killed in the Battle of Badr, Hamza bin Abdul Muttalib 
in Uhud and Ja'far bin Abu Taalib in the Battle of Mu'tah. Besides these three, there was 
another person (here Imam Ali (a) meant himself) who also tried his best to meet martyrdom. 
I could name him but the date of his death had not yet approached and he passed through 
these terrible ordeals alive. 
O time! O world! How could I wonder at your vagaries? People have started considering such 
a person (Mu'awiya) equal to me! He in his whole lifetime never exerted himself in the 
service of Islam and Allah as I have done at every moment of my life. In Islam there is no 
rank, no honour, no position and no merit for him as there is for me. No one can pretend to 
claim any superiority and excellence over me but a pretender. 
I do not know of anyone who served Islam and the Holy Prophet (s) as sincerely and as 
constantly as I have. The Almighty Lord knows that I am not wrong in claiming what I have 
said and no one can be compared to me in this respect. All Glory, Praise and Greatness 
belongs to Him and to nobody else. 
You have requested me to send to you all those people who were responsible for the murder 
of Uthman. I pondered over your request and found that it was not in my power to send them 
to you or to anybody else. 
I swear by my life that if you do not leave your hypocrisy, avarice and your rebellious 
activities they will make themselves known to you. 
Instead of your demanding them they will demand for you. On the sea and land and in the 
plains and on the hills they will make their presence known to you and you will not find it 
easy or pleasant to face them and will curse the day when you demanded to see them.
