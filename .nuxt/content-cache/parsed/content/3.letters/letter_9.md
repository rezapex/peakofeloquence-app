They conspired against us and made plots after plots to harm us.\nThey tried their best to frighten and injure us. They forced us to leave our homes and to retire\nto the cave of Shi'b Abi Taalib. It was a very rough and hard place to live in, and we were\nforced to lead a very harsh life. Their instigated their tribe as well as other clans to fight\nagainst us. The Merciful Allah came to our help. He protected and defended us.\nFrom amongst us those who had faith in the Holy Prophet (s) and Islam stood up to defend\nhim and his cause; their desire was to achieve the favour of the Lord; and those of Bani\nHashim who had not embraced Islam as yet like Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib also came to our\nhelp because we belonged to them and they to us. From amongst the Quraysh, the condition\nof those who had embraced Islam, was not as bad as ours.\nEither they had defensive alliance with the non-believers or some tribes decided to defend\nthem despite their differences in religion. While it was the practice of the Holy Prophet (s)\nthat whenever a battle was raged and his companions behaved cowardly or ran away from the\nbattlefield (as in Badr, Uhud and Hunayn) which was usually the case or started making the\nMuslims nervous (as in Khandaq), he sent members of his family (Bani Hashim) to fight out\nthe battle to protect his companions.\nThese members of Bani Hashim often fought single handed and some even met martyrdom as\nfor instance, Ubayda bin Haarith was killed in the Battle of Badr, Hamza bin Abdul Muttalib\nin Uhud and Ja'far bin Abu Taalib in the Battle of Mu'tah. Besides these three, there was\nanother person (here Imam Ali (a) meant himself) who also tried his best to meet martyrdom.\nI could name him but the date of his death had not yet approached and he passed through\nthese terrible ordeals alive.\nO time! O world! How could I wonder at your vagaries? People have started considering such\na person (Mu'awiya) equal to me! He in his whole lifetime never exerted himself in the\nservice of Islam and Allah as I have done at every moment of my life. In Islam there is no\nrank, no honour, no position and no merit for him as there is for me. No one can pretend to\nclaim any superiority and excellence over me but a pretender.\nI do not know of anyone who served Islam and the Holy Prophet (s) as sincerely and as\nconstantly as I have. The Almighty Lord knows that I am not wrong in claiming what I have\nsaid and no one can be compared to me in this respect. All Glory, Praise and Greatness\nbelongs to Him and to nobody else.\nYou have requested me to send to you all those people who were responsible for the murder\nof Uthman. I pondered over your request and found that it was not in my power to send them\nto you or to anybody else.\nI swear by my life that if you do not leave your hypocrisy, avarice and your rebellious\nactivities they will make themselves known to you.\nInstead of your demanding them they will demand for you. On the sea and land and in the\nplains and on the hills they will make their presence known to you and you will not find it\neasy or pleasant to face them and will curse the day when you demanded to see them."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_9.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_9.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"mpQrddxc0C"}
