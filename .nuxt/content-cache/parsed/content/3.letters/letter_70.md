I want to inform you and your subjects that if the\nsoldiers misbehave themselves or if they take anything, their action is against my orders.\nExcept for the condition that they accidentally fall short of the ration and can find no way to\nappease their appetite, if they take anything from anybody they are to be punished.\nYou may punish them. But take care and do not allow the foolish and insolent people of your\nplace to quarrel with them or insult them or interfere with or obstruct the things that I have\npermitted them. I shall also be following the army.\nYou may report to me of any excess or violence committed within your jurisdiction, of any\nawkward and difficult position in which you find yourself, or of any harshness or atrocity\nwhich was perpetrated in your province and which you cannot redeem without the help of\nAllah and your Imam. If you report all such affairs to me, Allah willing I shall attend to them\nand settle them to the satisfaction of all."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_70.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_70.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"tVZocTt0ms"}
