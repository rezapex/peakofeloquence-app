Ibn Abbas! Muhammad, (may his soul rest in peace), died as a martyr and Egypt has fallen in 
the hands of the enemies. I beseech the Reward of Allah for the sorrow I feel and the grief I 
suffer on account of the martyrdom of this young man who was like a son to me. He loved 
me. He was faithful to me. So far as the defense of the Islamic State is concerned he was like 
a sharp sword and an impregnable fort. 
Long before this deplorable event I had issued orders to the Heads of various provinces and to 
the people of Kufa to reach him or send help to him when he calls for it. I had repeated these 
orders. Some went to his help but half-heartedly, others started submitting excuses, while 
some sent false reports of important engagements and did not co-operate with him. 
I feel disgusted and pray to Allah to relieve me of the society of such faithless and worthless 
people. 
I swear by Allah that had I no desire of dying as a martyr, and had I not been ready for my 
death awaiting night and day, I would not have liked to live amongst them even for a day and 
I would not have come out with them to fight against the enemies of Allah and Islam.
