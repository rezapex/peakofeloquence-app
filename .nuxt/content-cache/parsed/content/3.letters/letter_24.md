Do not let the\npleasures of today make you forget the tomorrow, the Day of Reckoning and Judgement.\nKeep money with you strictly according to your real requirements and give away the rest to\nthe poor so that it may act as a provision for you in the next world.\nDo you expect Allah to grant you rewards reserved for courteous, kind and benevolent\npeople, while you actually are proud, vain, haughty and miserly? Do you hope to receive His\nBlessings reserved for charitable, generous and kind-hearted persons who always help the\npoor and the needy, while you, rolling in wealth and luxuries, prevent any part of your wealth\nfrom reaching the disabled persons and poverty-ridden old widows?\nRemember a man receives the reward according to actions he has done in this world because\nin the next world only the result of such deeds as he has done during his lifetime shall reach\nhim."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_24.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_24.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"ybauV9F3ni"}
