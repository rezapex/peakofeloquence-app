The fact of the case is that I did not bring\nabout this change because I found you weak and inefficient and wanted to make you more\nenergetic and strong but because as a change I wanted to send you to a place where the work\nwas easier and which you would find more congenial.\nUndoubtedly the man whom I sent as the Governor of Egypt was very faithful to us and very\nsevere against our enemies.
