I am sure that if you give up self-aggrandizement and self-interest, if you\nforsake the idea of being alive only to personal profits and pleasures, if you cease to be\nactuated solely by selfishness and if you ponder over the incident leading to the murder of\nUthman, you will realize that I cannot at all be held responsible for the affair and I am the\nleast concerned with the episode.\nBut it is a different thing that you create all these false rumours and carry on this heinous\npropaganda to gain your ulterior motives. Well you may do whatever you like."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_6.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_6.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"RryokY1NAy"}
