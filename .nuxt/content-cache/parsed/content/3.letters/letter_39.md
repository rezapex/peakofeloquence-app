Having no faith in the truth of\nIslam you have led others astray. You have thrown them in the depths of ignorance. You have\nenticed them towards the abyss for unenlightenment and illiteracy. They were out to reach\ntruth but they cannot reach it now, because of you. They have lost the true path of religion.\nThey are becoming sceptics and most of them are returning to infidelity of pre-Islamic days.\nTheirs is an unfortunate plight. A few wise men from amongst them who have seen your ways\nand who realized the intensity of your viciousness and your cunningness in turning them\naway from the ways of Islam, have given you up and have turned towards Allah. They are\nfortunate and may be blessed.\nO Mu'awiya! Fear Allah, do not let the Devil lead you to Hell, throw away its yoke which is\ntied round your neck, remember that this life will after all come to an end and soon you will\nhave to face the next world."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_39.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_39.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"KIRTqabACp"}
