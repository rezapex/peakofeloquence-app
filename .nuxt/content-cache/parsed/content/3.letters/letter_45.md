He is Maalik bin Haarith Mazhiji (Mazhij is a subclass\nof Bani Nakha'a).\nHear him and obey his commands which you will find to be right and according to true\ncanons of Islam. He is such a sword among the swords of Allah that its sharpness will never\nget blunt or whose stroke and blow will never be without effect and who will never lose an\nopportunity. If he orders you to advance against your enemies, then advance; if he commands\nyou to halt then halt because he himself will never advance nor halt and will never give orders\nto advance, halt or retreat without my consent.\nIn sending him to you, I have given preference to your needs over those of mine so that he\nmay serve you faithfully and may treat your enemies severely and strongly."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_45.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_45.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"Lk1GBt1mSP"}
