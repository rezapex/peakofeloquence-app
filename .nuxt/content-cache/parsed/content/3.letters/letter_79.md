So far as\npresumptions of actions and things, lawful, legitimate and allowable or unlawful, forbidden\nand prohibited are concerned, accept the rulings of the Holy Book. Confirm and testify the\ntruth said before (religions of ancient prophets). Take lessons from history for your future\nbecause history often repeats itself, and future nations of the world will mostly follow the\nfootsteps of those who have passed. But this whole world is going to end and every individual\nhas to leave it some day or the other.\nKeeping in mind the Might of Allah, be particularly careful not to swear by Him unless you\nare taking an oath for a true and lawful affair. Always remember death and the life after death\nbut never wish for death. If you want to face death then do it for a great cause.\nTry to avoid all those things which a man may like for himself and may grudge for others.\nAbstain from an action which you will have to do covertly and secretly and which you feel\nashamed to do openly. Refrain from a deed which you will have to accept as evil or bad or for\nwhich you will have to tender an apology or excuse.\nDo not acquire a bad reputation and do not allow your good reputation to be sullied. Do not\nmention hearsay things as authenticated facts, such a practice will be sufficient for you to be\nregarded by others as liar. Do not develop the habit of contradicting and falsifying others on\nevery occasion, it is a disgusting habit.\nHave a control on your temper. If you have power to retaliate, then forgive and forget. When\nin anger, be forbearing, patient and tolerant. When you are in possession of wealth, power and\nauthority, then be forgiving, merciful and compassionate. These traits will help you to gain\nyour salvation.\nBe sincerely thankful for all the Blessings which the Merciful Allah has granted you, pray for\ntheir continuance, do not misuse them and do not waste them and you must show by your\ndeeds the extent of your obligations to Him for His Blessings.\nRemember that among the faithful Muslims the best is he who gives out alms and charities on\nhis on behalf and on behalf of his family and his property. Whatever you spend in this way is\nsomething that you send in advance for your life after death. You will then receive the reward\nof such deeds. And whatever you leave here will be used by others and you will get no benefit\nout of it.\nAvoid the company of men who are weak in their decisions and views, who are superstitious\nand wicked because people are judged by the company they keep. If possible try to live in\nlarge cities because they are the centres of Islamic Culture and Islamic traditions. Avoid\nplaces where time is wasted in pastimes and amusements, where there are concentrations of\nignorant people and where you find scarcity of companions or lack of society and\nsurroundings to carry on your religious functions.\nKeep yourself busy with your work and do not frequent abodes meant for vicious pursuits\nbecause they are centres of the activities of Satan and the places which spread vice and\nwickedness.\nAlways look to the conditions of people not so well off as you are because observation of\ntheir lives and positions will make you more content with your lot in life and more thankful to\nAllah for it.\nNever start on a travel on Fridays without attending Friday prayers unless you are going out\nfor Jihad or there is no alternative for you but to set out.\nIn all of your affairs keep the thought of Allah in your mind and act according to His\nCommands and interdictions because obedience to His Orders has priority over every other\nthing. By various means and in various ways persuade yourself towards prayers but do not be\nhard with yourself, be gentle and persuasive. When you are free from other duties and you are\nhaving good health then spend your free hours in prayers. But the question of offering daily\nprayers (five times a day) is a different question. They have to be offered compulsorily and in\ntime.\nTake care that such a calamity may not overtake you that while you are trying to ignore\nreligion and Allah and are running after a vicious world, death overtakes you.\nAvoid the company of wicked people because bad company allures a person towards evil\nways. Always keep the Might and Majesty of Allah in view and be a friend of His friends. Be\nafraid of your own anger because out of the armies of Satan, man's anger is its strongest force."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_79.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_79.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"sVPgG6kyPv"}
