I order you not to pretend fear of\nAllah and assume false piety and to go against His Orders secretly. One whose deeds coincide\nwith his words and who is as honest in his secret activities as in open deeds, is the person who\nhas faithfully discharged the duty laid down upon him by the Lord, his honesty handed over\nthe things entrusted to him and has sincerely obeyed Allah only to achieve His Favours and\nBlessings.\nI order you not to meet Muslims as a tyrant or an oppressor, not to ill-treat them and not to\ncalumniate them because they are your brothers in religion and they will help you to collect\ntaxes and to find means and ways to help the poor.\nCertainly there is a share for you in Zakat but remember that the poor, the destitute and the\nhave-nots also have claim over it.\nVerily, I have paid you your share and now you should pay them their shares otherwise there\nwill be many who will complain and protest against you on the Day of Judgement (they will\nbe your enemies on that day). Woe be to the person against whom the poor, the destitute, the\nbeggars and those who have been deprived of their rights of receiving Zakat complain before\nAllah.\nBe it known to you that the person who misappropriates Zakat funds, who will fill his\nstomach with such amounts, and who harms his religion and injures his conscience with such\ndeeds will be punished and disgraced in this world as well as the next. The worst form of\ndishonesty is the breach of trust of the public funds (Zakat) and the most despicable example\nof maladministration is that the Imam should tolerate such forms of dishonesty."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_29.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_29.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"vvnETNXOZI"}
