I have received information that a person of Basra invited you to a dinner and\nyou immediately accepted the invitation. I have also heard that very sumptuous meals were\nserved there! Finest varieties of viands were placed before you in large plates and you\nenjoyed them.\nI am sorry to hear the news. I never expected that you would accept the invitation of a person\nwho invites big officers and rich people and from whose doors poor persons and hungry\npaupers are turned away rudely.\nLook carefully into the things which you eat. If there is even a shade of their being obtained\nunlawfully then throw them away, only eat those things about which you are perfectly certain\nthat they are obtained by honest means.\nYou must know Ibn Hunayf, that for everyone who follows a religion there is a leader and a\nguide from whom the follower learns the canons of that religion and the ways of leading a\npious life. Now look to your Imam (Imam Ali (a) meant himself).\nIn this world he has satisfied himself with two old, torn and coarse garments and two pieces\nof bread (one in the morning and one in the evening). I know that to adopt such a hard way of\nlife is beyond you but at least try to be pious. Try to follow me and be my companion in\nvirtue, piety and simple living.\nI swear by Allah that from this world I have neither amassed gold nor have I gathered wealth\nand possessions nor have I changed these coarse and old garments of mine with even an\nordinary raiment from your treasury.\nVerily, under the sky we had only Fadak as our personal property but we were deprived of it,\nit tempted them, they took it by force and we had to bear the wrench patiently and cheerfully,\nthe best judge is the Lord Almighty. What was I going to do with Fadak or with any other\nworldly possession? I never wanted them for myself. I know that tomorrow my lodging will\nbe my grave.\nIts darkness will cover my traces and will not allow my condition to reach this world. A grave\nafter all is a pit, and even if it is made very big and broad, time will gradually reduce its size\nand will fill it with earth and stones.\nMy attention is concentrated on one thing, that is, with the help of the fear of Allah and piety I\nkeep my desires under control so that in this world I may not commit sins and errors and on\nthe Day of Judgement when fear will be the lot of everybody I may feel safe and satisfied.\nIf I had so wanted I could have very easily found ways and means to provide for myself the\npurest honey, the best variety of wheat and the finest silk clothes that could be woven.\nBut it is not possible for inordinate cravings to overcome me and it is not possible that\ngreediness persuades me to acquire the best provisions when in Hijaz and Yemen there may\nbe people who have no hope of obtaining a piece of bread and who have never satisfied their\nhunger fully.\nIt is not possible for me to satiate myself when there are around me people whom hunger and\nthirst keeps restless and agonized.\nDo you want me to be like that person about whom somebody has very aptly said, \"Is this\ndisease not enough for you that you keep on sleeping with your stomach full, and around you\nthere are such starving mouths that will greedily eat even dried goat-skin\"?\nShall I be satisfied simply because people call me \"Amir al-Mu'minin\" (Leader of the faithful\nMuslims)? Shall I not sympathise with the faithful Muslims in their calamities? Shall I not be\ntheir partner in their adversities? Shall I not be their fellow-sufferer? Shall I not set an\nexample for them to patiently, courageously and virtuously bear privation?\nAm I created simply to keep on thinking about my food? Am I like that animal which is tied\ndown to a post and which thinks of nothing but its fodder or like that uncontrolled beast\nwhich roams about and does nothing but eats its fill and does not know the purpose of life for\nwhich it is created? Have I no religion, no conscience and no fear of Allah? Am I left\nabsolutely free without any check or control to do as I like? Am I at liberty to go astray, to\nwander away from the true path of religion and to roam about in the wilderness of greed and\navarice?\nI am sure some of you would say that if the son of Abu Taalib eats so little and lives on\nstarvation, then surely he must have gone weak and exhausted and must be unfit to face his\nenemies in battlefields.\nBut you must remember that hardy trees which grow on the border of deserts have very strong\ntimber; and trees which are found in marshy lands have thin bark and soft wood, similarly\nwhen the former are lit up they burn longer and with a very strong glow and give out more\nheat than the latter.\nMy relationship with the Holy Prophet (s) is like a branch shooting from the same stem or like\nthe relation of the wrist to the arm. I swear by Allah that even if all the Arabs unite together\nagainst me I shall not run away from the battlefield and when the occasion arrives I shall do\nmy best to subdue them, at the same time I shall try to clean the earth of the existence and\nvicious influence of that untimely evil genius and warped mind (Mu'awiya) so that the land\nmay be free of his wicked and sinful sway.\nO vicious world! Do not try to snare me, you cannot entrap me, I am beyond your temptations\nand pitfalls and I have taken good care not to slip into such pitfalls.\nWhere are those people whom you had tempted with pleasures and enjoyments? Where are\nthose groups whom you had allured with pomp and glory? They are imprisoned in their\ngraves pressed down by tons of earth upon them. O vicious world! Had you been a person or\na being with life and limbs I would have punished you under the laws of the Lord because\nyou have tempted with impossible hopes millions of individuals from the true path of\nhumanity, you have brought about destruction, decline and falls of nations after nations\nalluring them with power and pleasure, you have thrown crowned heads into dust, you have\nlowered them to such depths that there is no refuge for any of them at that place and no one\ncan come out from there.\nWoe be to the man who with misplaced confidence, steps on the slippery ground presented by\nyou as a firm foothold, he will certainly slip; woe be to the man who thinks of riding the\nwaves of false hopes and expectations raised by you, he will surely sink.\nWhoever tries not to be entrapped by your temptations and snared by your allurements will\nfind the straight path to safety and salvation. Whoever tries to spurn you does not care for the\nconsequences of his action though he may find himself in adverse circumstances and\ndifficulties. To him this world, its pleasures and the life surrounded by the pleasures or by\nwoes and afflictions, is like a day which will soon pass away.\nBe gone from me. I can neither be caught unawares by you that you may plunge me into\ndisgrace and humiliations nor will I lose control of myself that you may drag me wherever\nyou like.\nI swear by Allah that barring His Destiny over which I have no control and which may mould\nmy life as He wishes, I shall control myself that I shall be contented and happy if I get one\npiece of bread with a pinch of salt and that my mind will be dead to the desires of pleasures,\nfame, power and glory.\nIbn Hunayf! You have seen sheep and goats, after eating and drinking their fill they retire to\ntheir den. Do you want Ali to be like them - to eat, drink and enjoy? May I get blind if after\nhaving passed so many years of my life I now turn into an animal in human form!\nHappy is the person who did his duty with Allah and man, who bore adversities patiently and\nwhen sleep overpowered him he used his hand as a pillow and lay on mere earth along with\nthose whom fear of the Day of Judgement has often kept awake, who do not find much time\nto sleep, whose lips keep on moving glorifying Allah, and whose sins have been absolved on\naccount of the penance they impose upon themselves. They are noble persons and they\ncertainly will secure salvation.\nO Ibn Hunayf! fear Allah and be content with the bread that you get with lawful means, so\nthat you may be exempted and free from the fire of Hell."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_52.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_52.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"SpTsC4uHDV"}
