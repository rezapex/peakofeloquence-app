You know this wealth has\nbeen gathered by Jihad in which many of them were killed and many more of them were\nwounded.\nI swear by Allah who gave life to plants and animals that if this accusation against you proves\ncorrect then you will humiliate yourself in my eyes and will lose the good opinion I have\nformed about you.\nDo not imagine that the trust reposed in you by Allah can be treated lightly, do not ruin your\nreligion otherwise you will be one of those whose deeds are to be punished.\nRemember that all the Muslims who are there or here have equal share in this wealth.\nBelieving and acting on this principle, they come to me for their share and receiving it from\nme they return to their places."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_50.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_50.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"P8pnm23WCv"}
