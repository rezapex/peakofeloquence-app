I have received certain information about you and if you have actually done what is reported 
against you then you have verily, displeased Allah and have annoyed me. 
I am given to understand that you are lavishly distributing State treasury among the bedouins 
of your clan and among those Arab nomads who are loyal to you. You know this wealth has 
been gathered by Jihad in which many of them were killed and many more of them were 
wounded. 
I swear by Allah who gave life to plants and animals that if this accusation against you proves 
correct then you will humiliate yourself in my eyes and will lose the good opinion I have 
formed about you. 
Do not imagine that the trust reposed in you by Allah can be treated lightly, do not ruin your 
religion otherwise you will be one of those whose deeds are to be punished. 
Remember that all the Muslims who are there or here have equal share in this wealth. 
Believing and acting on this principle, they come to me for their share and receiving it from 
me they return to their places.
