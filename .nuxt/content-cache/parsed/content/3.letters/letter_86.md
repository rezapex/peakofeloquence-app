Treat people kindly, receive them in audience, do not be very harsh in issuing and enforcing 
orders, do not lose temper because this weakness is always a good opening for Satan to find 
its way into your mind. Always keep this in mind that the thing which takes you nearer to 
Allah will carry you away from Hell and the thing which drives you away from Allah will 
drive you towards Hell.
