People are put to\ntest here so that they may be rewarded according to their merits.\nOur life does not end here and we are not created only for this world. Nor are we ordered to\nconcentrate our energies only to acquire pleasures, power and pomp here. We are brought\nhere simply to be tested in accordance to our knowledge, intentions and activities.\nYou are being tested through me and I am being tested through you. Each one of us is to be an\nevidence of the demonstration of the intentions and deeds of the other - whether they have\nbeen pious or sinful. You began by misinterpreting the Holy Qur'an and on the basis of these\nmisinterpretations you started grasping power and wealth and began oppressing and\ntyrannizing the people. Your next unholy action was to call me responsible for an action\n(murder of Caliph Uthman) of which my tongue and hands were both innocent.\nYou with the Syrians tried your best to bring this deed to my door. The learned from your side\npersuaded the ignorant and influential people, and drove the commoners to rise against me.\nFear Allah and do let Satan drive you wherever it wants, think of death and the life after death\nbecause that is the only resting-place for you and me and for every human being. Be afraid of\nthe Wrath of Almighty Allah which may throw you into such a calamity that it will not only\nbe an end of you but an end of your dynasty.\nI swear, and my oath is such that I have no intention of breaking it, that if fate so arranges as\nto bring us face to face against each other then I shall not leave the battlefield: \"Until Allah\njudges between us, and He is the best Judge\""}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_64.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_64.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"JfERM3UibR"}
