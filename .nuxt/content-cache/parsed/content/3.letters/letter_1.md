Out of the Muhajirs I\nwas the only man who wanted to appease and pacify the people and who did not want to\nindulge in the activities of those dissatisfied persons, while Talha and Zubayr were instigating\nthe populace in such a way that the least they said was worse than the worst that could be\nasserted or alleged against Uthman.\nTheir whispering campaign was deadlier than the loudest propaganda which could be carried\non; Aisha also exhibited extreme annoyance and anger against him. Under such conditions\nsome persons resolved to kill him and they murdered him. Then everybody (friends and foes\nalike) came to me and took the oath of allegiance to me.\nThis was done without any desire, instigation, inducement, persuasion or compulsion and\nforce on my part. They came to me of their own free-will, without hesitation, and with\npleasure, ecstasy and joy.\nLet it be known to you that the people of the city towards which the Holy Prophet (s) had\nmigrated (Madina), is being deserted by its inhabitants, they are leaving it, it is seething with\ndiscontentment and rebellion. A seditious campaign has started against the Amir. I want you\nto come to the help of your Amir to fight against his enemies."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_1.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_1.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"1gewLKsBPp"}
