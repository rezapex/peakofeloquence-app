When you do not find a true way to do the thing on hand, then do not\npersist on the wrong way and when find a correct solution, then do not be lethargic in\nadopting it.\nIn short do everything at a proper time and in a proper way and keep everything in its proper\nplace.\nDo not reserve for yourself anything which is a common property of all and in which others\nhave equal rights. Do not close your eyes from glaring malpractice of the officers, miscarriage\nof justice and misuse of rights because you will be held responsible for the wrong thus done\nto others. In the near future your wrong practices and maladministration will be exposed and\nyou will be held responsible and punished for the wrong done to the helpless and oppressed\npeople. Take care and keep control over you temper, your anger and your desire to be\narrogant and vain. Take care of your hands when you are out to deliver punishment and of the\nsharpness of your tongue when you are saying harsh things. The best way to achieve this is\nnot to be hasty in making remarks and to delay in delivering punishment so that you may keep\nyour temper under control and are not overexcited.\nAnd you cannot achieve this unless you constantly remember that you have to return to Allah\nand unless His fear overcomes every other sentiment.\nYou must always try to remember the good and useful things done in the past, activities of a\njust and benign regime, good deeds done by it, good laws promulgated, instructions of the\nHoly Prophet (s), commands of Allah given in His Holy Book and things that you have seen\nme doing or have heard me saying. Follow the good actions and advice found therein.\nSimilarly, follow carefully the pieces of advice contained in these orders. Through them I\nhave tried to teach you all that can be taught about a good regime. I have done my duty\ntowards you so that you may not go astray and your mind may not crave for base desires. If it\ndoes then you will have no excuse before Allah.\nI beseech Allah that by His Limitless Mercy and by His Supreme Might He may grant our\nprayers, that He may lead both of us to the Divine Guidance of achieving His Pleasure, of\nsuccessfully pleading our cases before Him, justifying our deeds before man, of gaining good\nrepute, of leaving good results of our benign and just rule with ever expanding prosperity and\never increasing welfare of the State and of meeting our ends as martyrs and pious persons, as\nour return is towards Him only.\nMay the peace of Allah be upon the Holy Prophet (s) and His chosen descendants."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.letters:letter_62.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.letters/letter_62.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"w26PRWW20I"}
