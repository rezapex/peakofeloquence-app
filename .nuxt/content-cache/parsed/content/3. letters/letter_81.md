I thought you were a worthy son of a worthy father and were following him in his\nhonesty and righteousness. But all of a sudden I received about you news which confirms the\nfact that you do not check and control your inordinate desires, that you do not attach any\nimportance to your life after death and you want to adorn and beautify you life at the cost of\nyour salvation and that you are forsaking your religion to provide for your relatives.\nIf all that is reported to me about you is correct, then the very camel you own or even the\nstrap-shoe is superior to you. You and men of your calibre are not the persons to be confided\nwith the financial affairs of a country or to be assigned to important vacancies of the State or\nto be entrusted to check and control dishonesty and disloyalty. Therefore, as soon as you\nreceive this letter come back to me."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3. letters:letter_81.md","_source":"content","_file":"3. letters/letter_81.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"M3vhPpkpHX"}
