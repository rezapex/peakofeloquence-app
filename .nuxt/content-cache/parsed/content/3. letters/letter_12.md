Do not involve the whole army in the encounter, allow only a few\nunits to take part in the engagements. If your army is not on a hilltop then post your scouts\nand guards on high vantage points and along the line of fortification so that the enemy may\nnot take you unawares.\nRemember that the commanders of an army are its guardians and the eyes of these\ncommanders are the scouts.\nTry to avoid dissensions and do not cause superiority or inferiority complexes to take root\namong your officers and in your ranks. Wherever and whenever you camp, make it a point\nthat all of your officers and soldiers camp in the same locality and are provided with the same\ncomforts and conveniences and whenever you march, always march in company formation. If\nyou want to rest during the night draw a circular formation of your lancers round your army\nand do not let sound sleep overpower you."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3. letters:letter_12.md","_source":"content","_file":"3. letters/letter_12.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"wg0dalrWU0"}
