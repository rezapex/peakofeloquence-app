Well, Mu'awiya! You made the people laugh at your words, they\nwere feeling very sad and depressed at the standard of mental depravity exhibited by you.\nWhen did you find the sons of Abdul Muttalib (the grandfather of the Holy Prophet (s) and\nImam Ali (a)) timid in facing their enemies or getting afraid of brandishing swords?\nJust wait a little, you will in the near future have to face the attack of a brave soldier. He will\nshortly invite you for the encounter you are desiring for. The thing which you apparently wish\nfor is not as far away as you imagine it to be. I am coming towards you with an army of\nMuhajirs, Ansar and those companions who have sincere faith in me. Theirs is a powerful\ncongregation. Their movements will raise huge clouds of dust (indicating the strength of the\narmy). They are prepared to die or to kill. They believe that the best that could happen to the\nis to receive the Blessings of the Lord by their good deeds. Sons of those warriors who routed\nyour clan in the Battle of Badr is with them.\nThe swords of Bani Hashim are with them. And you have already realized the sharpness of\nthese swords when your brother, your maternal uncle, your grandfather and kinsmen were\nkilled (those people were killed by Imam Ali (a) in the battles of Badr and Uhud). These\nswords are now nearing the despots who have tyrannized the Muslim world.\n,.\n,. ,. ,.\n,.\n,. ,. ,.\n,. ,. ,."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3. letters:letter_35.md","_source":"content","_file":"3. letters/letter_35.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"98MLOtnFUb"}
