But Ziyad grew \nup to be an intelligent man and a very good orator. Everybody knew that Ziyad was born out \nof wedlock. Umar during his caliphate, did not give him any chance but later on he became a \ngovernor and Imam Ali (a) had allowed him to retain that post. When Mu'awiya came to \npower, he started corresponding secretly with Ziyad, inviting him to leave the side of Imam \nAli (a) and to join him, offering him the bribe of being declared the son of Abu Sufyan. When \nImam Ali (a) came to know of these secret messages he wrote the following letter to Ziyad. ]I am given to understand that Mu'awiya has been corresponding with you. Beware, he wants \nto make a fool of you, to blunt your intelligence and to harm your self-respect. Remember \nthat it is Satan which will attack an imprudent and incautious Muslim from behind and from \nright and left so that finding him unwary and unwatchful, it may overpower him and may \nenslave his reasoning. \nThe fact is that during the Caliphate of Caliph Umar, Abu Sufyan unwisely gave utterances to \nsomething which was unjustifiable and unreasonable. It was one of those evil suggestions of \nSatan which are not only an insult to a self-respecting man but which cannot help in proving \nthe descent (according to the laws of Islam) or in legalizing the heritage. The condition of a \nman claiming such a lineage is that of a gate crasher in a party from which he may be thrown \nout with humiliation."},"hash":"l2syM73FK7"}
