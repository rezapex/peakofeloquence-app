You must know that this world has two \naspects; one of its phases is that sometimes it serves you and works in your favour, and the \nother is that, it acts against you. This world is a place for empires to come and go; it is an \nabode of constant change. \nHere anything and everything which has been destined to do you good will reach you though \nyou may not be strong and fit enough to try for it, and the loss, if it has been decreed for you, \nwill come to you however hard you may try to avoid it."},"hash":"r2yw4YjaRp"}
