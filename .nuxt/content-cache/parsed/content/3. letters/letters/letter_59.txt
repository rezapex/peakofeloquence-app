The Maghrib prayers should be performed when \npeople break their fasts and when Hajj pilgrims return from Arafat. And the time for Ice \nprayers is when the red glow of the even twilight disappears from the West, till one-third of \nthe night is still left. The morning prayers are to be performed when there appears enough \nlight of the dawn for a man to recognize the face of his companion. \nWhile leading the prayers make them so short that the weakest among you may not feel tired \nto follow you and his strength and patience may not be over strained."},"hash":"0YTgaLlkqB"}
