He was the Governor of Hayit and had not properly defended the province \nagainst the Syrian guerrillas. After their attack and loot he wanted permission of Imam Ali (a) \nto take revenge upon the Syrian province of Kirkisiya. Imam Ali (a) replied to him in the \nfollowing letter. ]It is wrong to a person to disregard and neglect the duty entrusted to him and try to take up \nthe work entrusted to somebody else and at a time when he is not required to do it. Such an \nattitude indicates a weak and harmful mentality. Your desire to invade Kirkisiya and to leave \nyour province undefended and unattended shows the confusion of your mind. By such an \naction you will convert yourself into a kind of bridge which your enemy can cross \nconveniently to reach your friends. \nThus you will be a useless auxiliary who has neither power nor prestige nor dignity, who \ncannot stop his enemy's in-roads, nor can crush him, and who cannot defend his subject nor \ncan he be of any use or help to his ruler."},"hash":"hSliTpEUQc"}
