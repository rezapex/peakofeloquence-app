May the Merciful Lord reward you on His behalf and on behalf of the \nAhlul Bayt (Progeny of the Holy Prophet) (a) for obeying their orders and coming to their \nhelp. May He reward you more handsomely than He rewards those who obey His commands \n(because you followed the true path against very heavy odds and in spite of alluring \nenticements). \nYou have done your duty.
