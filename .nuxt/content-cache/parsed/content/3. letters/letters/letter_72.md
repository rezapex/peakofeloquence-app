When the Holy Prophet (s) passed away,\nthe Muslims started a tug-of-war for the caliphate. I swear by Allah that at that juncture it\ncould not even be imagined that the Arabs would snatch the seat of the caliphate from the\nfamily and descendants of the Holy Prophet (s) and that they would be swearing the oath of\nallegiance for the caliphate to a different person.\nAt every stage I kept myself aloof from that struggle of supremacy and power-politics till I\nfound the heretics had openly taken to heresy and schism and were trying to undermine and\nruin the religion preached by our Holy Prophet (s). I felt afraid that, even after seeing and\nrecognizing the evil, if I did not stand up to help Islam and the Muslims it would be a worse\ncalamity to me than my losing authority and power over you, which was only a transient and\nshort-lived affair. Therefore, when I stood up amidst the sweeping surge of innovations and\nschism the dark clouds of heresy dispersed, falsehood and schism were crushed and the\nreligion was saved.\nI swear by Allah that if I alone come out to face them and if all the world joins them, I shall\nneither feel nervous nor will I attach any care to their following. By the Grace of Allah, I\nknow fully well what kind of reprobates they are and how they persist in vice and sin.\nI am very anxious to reach the Realm of Allah and I earnestly hope and pray for His Blessings\nand Favours. But it grieves me to see that this nation and country is being ruled by\nuneducated, unwise and vicious rulers. They grasp the wealth of the country and drive its\npeople into slavery. They hate pious and good people and quarrel or fight with them. They\ngather heretics and sinners around them and are happy in such company. You have had\nexperience of some of them. One of them was punished for drinking wine. Among this crowd\nthere is a man who did not embrace Islam until he found Islam to be not a faith or religion but\na powerful State offering enormous possibility of gaining power and wealth.\nIf I had no desire of saving Islam and Islamic society from the influence and sway of such\npeople, I would not have called you for Jihad, I would not have tried to make you see the\nreality of the situation, I would not have exerted myself to assemble you and I would not have\npersuaded you to defend the cause of Allah and finding you so indifferent towards the good of\nIslam and observing your reluctance to help its cause, I would have left you to your condition.\nDo you not see and realize that the boundaries of your State are getting shorter and shorter\ndaily and parts of your kingdom are being snatched and usurped, your properties are being\nconfiscated and your cities are being invaded. May Allah have Mercy upon you. Come out to\ndefend your country, your property and your religion from the in-roads of your enemies. Do\nnot be lazy, careless and cowardly, otherwise your lot will be only disgrace.\nRemember, a warrior is always wary and vigilant and never careless and negligent. Whoever\nis careless about his cause, his enemy will not sleep over this advantage."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3. letters:letters:letter_72.md","_source":"content","_file":"3. letters/letters/letter_72.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"FjKZWS0MAi"}
