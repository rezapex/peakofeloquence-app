And this will not\nallow him to be just and fair to all. But so far as justice and equity are concerned your\ntreatment of all should be fair and unprejudiced. Remember that nothing can compensate for\ntyranny and oppression.\nKeep yourself away from what you consider bad and evil in others. Try your best to fulfill the\nobligations laid down by Allah upon you and keep on hoping for His Reward and fear His\nWrath because this world is a place for trials and tests and whoever wastes his time here will\nrepent in the Hereafter.\nRemember that nothing will ever make you independent of the Blessings of Allah and He has\nmade it incumbent upon you to have complete control over your own self, that you, to the best\nof your ability, protect and guard the people over whom you rule. In this way you will be\nbenefited more than others whom you benefit."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3. letters:letters:letter_69.md","_source":"content","_file":"3. letters/letters/letter_69.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"IG9fb2zpWb"}
