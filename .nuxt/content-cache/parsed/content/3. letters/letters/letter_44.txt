How hopelessly you are engulfed in your inordinate and sinful desires, how \nmercilessly you are swept by such vicious and unholy cravings which misguide you in this \nlife and will bring you to a sad end. You have forsaken the cause of truth and justice and have \narrogantly spurned the arguments which are agreeable to Allah and were unacceptable to man. \nWhat do you mean by creating this faction and revolt with pretence of taking revenge on the \nmurderers of Uthman? \nThe real facts of the case are that during the life of Caliph Uthman, you only went to his help \nwhen this action in the end was profitable to you and you could get something out of him, and \nyou refused to help him when he was really in need of you and your support and for which he \nhad frequently requested you."},"hash":"rTnbDve95M"}
