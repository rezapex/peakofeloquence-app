Imam Ali (a) felt anxious about his safety and wrote the \nfollowing letter to him: ]After praising Allah and the Holy Prophet (s) I want to advise you that as soon as you receive \nthis letter of mine, force Mu'awiya for a reply to my letter written to him. Compel him to \ncome to a decision and to give a final reply. He must decide between two things. Either war \nor obedience. If it is going to be a war then I shall get ready to fight against him, and if it is \ngoing to be peace then you must make him swear the oath of allegiance to me and then you \nmust return."},"hash":"7IuYQxC7m4"}
