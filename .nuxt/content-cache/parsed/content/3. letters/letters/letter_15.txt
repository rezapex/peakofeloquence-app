It is because by the Favour of Allah \nyou are on the side of truth and justice. Leave them until they begin their hostilities and then \nyou are at liberty to take to fighting. Their keenness to begin a battle will be another proof of \nyour sincere belief in the orders of Allah . \nIf Allah favours you with success and inflicts defeat to the enemy, then do not attack those \nwho have surrendered, do not injure the disabled and weak, do not assault the wounded, do \nnot excite women and do not make them angry with rude behaviour even if they use harsh and \ninsulting words against your commander and officers because they are physically and \nmentally weak and get excited easily and frightened quickly. \nDuring the days of the Holy Prophet (peace of Allah be upon him and his descendants) we \nhad strict orders not to touch, molest or insult women though they were unbelievers. Even in \npre-Islamic days it was the custom that if a man struck a woman even with a stick or a stone, \nthe revenge had to be taken by his sons and descendants."},"hash":"9rua1Eyep7"}
