He sullies the reputation as well as the character of\nthose who keep company with him. He tries to deceive sober and sedate people. For the sake\nof remnants and crumbs of bread left over at his table, you have attached yourself to him. You\nare following him like a dog which follows a tiger, frightfully looks at its paws and waits to\nlive upon the refuse which it leaves of its kill.\nIn this way you have lost your self-respect and honour in this world and your salvation in the\nnext. You have ruined your present and future. Had you followed the true path, you would\nhave secured success in this world as well as in the Hereafter."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3. letters:letters:letter_46.md","_source":"content","_file":"3. letters/letters/letter_46.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"hXQNuEOumu"}
