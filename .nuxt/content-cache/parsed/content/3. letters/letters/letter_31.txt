{"parsed":{"_id":"content:3. letters:letters:letter_31.txt","body":"[ The following is a famous reply of Imam Ali (a) to the letter of Mu'awiya. It throws ample \nlight on many phases of the history of Islam from the time of its dawn up to the time of Imam \nAli (a). ]After glorifying Allah and praising the Holy Prophet (s) let it be known to you that I am in \nreceipt of your letter wherein you write to me that Almighty Allah selected Muhammad (s), \nthe Holy Prophet as the Messenger of His revelations and He helped those companions of the \nHoly Prophet (s) who sincerely exerted themselves to assist him. Is it not an irony of fate that \ncircumstances have favoured you to such a position that you dare remind us of the Favours \nwhich Allah bestowed upon us and the Blessings conferred by Him upon His chosen Prophet \n(s) who was one of us. You have nothing to do with them and you have no share in these \nBlessings and Favours. \nYour condition is like that of a man who carries dates to the date-growing districts or that of a \nman who tries to teach archery to the master from whom he has learnt the art. You believe \nthat the best of the people amongst the Muslims are so and so and you have started discussing \na subject (superiority of Muhajirs over Ansar) which if it is proved correct will not be of any \nuse to you, will not enhance your status and if it is repudiated, this repudiation will not harm \nyou because you are neither a Muhajir nor an Ansar. \nWhat have you to do with their respective status and prestige? What is that for you if one is \nconsidered superior to the other? How are you considered in their affairs? You are a freed and \nliberated slave, and slaves and their sons, though freed and liberated, cannot aspire to the \nstatus of Muhajirs and Ansar and they have no right to introduce unholy classification \namongst the Muhajirs and Ansar. Do you realize your limitations? You do not belong to \neither group, you are a liberated slave and son of liberated parents and you want to introduce \nan unhealthy division between these two groups. \nThe false status you have tried to grasp is not going to enhance your prestige (before Allah or \nthe people). Can you not think of remaining at the place where you old hostility towards Islam \nand the Holy Prophet (s) has kept you? How is the lower status or defeat of one class or a \nperson of that class, to whom you do not belong going to harm you and how is the success or \nhigher status of the other going to do you good? You have gone astray from the straight path \nand from the real teachings of Islam. Listen! I want to give you a short description of the \nBlessings of Allah upon us. \nA party of Muhajirs met martyrdom. They were killed in the cause of Islam and Allah. \neveryone of them was blessed by Allah with a status and rank. Out of them those who \nbelonged to my family and tribe, Bani Hashim, were granted an excellent status by Allah. \nHamza (the uncle of the Holy Prophet (s) and Imam Ali (a)) received the title of Chief of \nMartyrs (Sayyid al-Shuhada). The Holy Prophet (s) himself called him by this name after his \nmartyrdom and at his funeral ceremony. \nThe Holy Prophet (s) recited Takbir ('Allahu Akbar') seventy times as a mark of distinction \nfor him, which is not for any other Muslim. Some Muhajirs lost their hands in the battlefield \nbut when one of us (Ja'far, cousin of the Holy Prophet (s) and brother of Imam Ali (a)) lost \nboth of his hands and died in the battlefield, Allah granted him angelic wings and the Holy \nProphet (s) informed us that this martyr received the title of Tayyar (one who flies in \nParadise). If Allah had not disapproved man's habit of eulogizing and praising himself, I \nwould have given several such instances which speak of the enhancement of my prestige and \nstatus before Allah, instances which are accepted and can be testified by faithful Muslims \nabout which the hearers will have no reason to doubt. Do not be like a man whom the Devil \nhas laid astray. Accept the obvious truth when it faces you. \nListen O' Mu'awiya! We (Ahlul Bayt, the progeny of the Holy Prophet (s)) are unique \nexamples of the creation of Allah. For such a status, we are not under obligation to any person \nor tribe but the Almighty Allah who granted us these blessings. Human beings have received \nand will receive perfection through us. The perpetual supremacy and inherent superiority do \nnot prevent us from making contact with human beings or with your clan, we have married \namongst you and have established family connections with your (as well as with others) clan, \nthough you do not belong to our class. How can you be our equal when the Holy Prophet (s) \nbelongs to us and Abu Jahl, the worst enemy of Islam was from amongst you. \nAsadullah (lit. \"the Lion of Allah\" - a title of Imam Ali (a)) is from amongst us, while Asadul \nAhlaaf (lion of the opposing groups, who had sworn to fight against Islam and the Holy \nProphet (s)) was from you. \nThe two foremost leaders of the youth of Paradise (Imam Hasan (a) & Imam Husayn (a)) are \nfrom us and the children of Hell are from you. The best woman in the world (title bestowed \nby Allah upon Fatima (a)) the beloved daughter of the Holy Prophet (s) is from us, and the \nslanderer and the wood-carrying woman who tried to spend every hour of her life in doing \nharm to the Holy Prophet of Islam (s), was your aunt. There are so many other things similar \nto the few mentioned which praise us and speak ill of your clan and which show how far and \nsuperior we are to you. \nWe were faithful followers of the commandments of Allah and you and your clan always \nopposed Islam and accepted it out of sheer expediency simply to save yourselves from \nhumiliation and disgrace. \nOur sincerity in Islam and our services to its cause are the facts of history and history cannot \ndeny your enmity against Islam and the Holy Prophet (s). \nThe credit which you want to take away from us and the honour which you want to deprive us \nof is the one which the Holy Qur'an is carefully guarding for us. It says: \"Some relatives are \nsuperior and have excellence over others, according to the Book of Allah\""},"hash":"8aLHFQ8j2H"}
