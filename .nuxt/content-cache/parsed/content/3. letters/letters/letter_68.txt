So far as faith in Allah and the Holy Prophet (s) was concerned we never wanted \nthem (the Syrians) to believe in anything over and above or other than what they were \nbelieving in and they did not want us to change our faith. Both of us were united on these \nprinciples. The point of contention between us was the question of the murder of Uthman. It \nhad created the split. They wanted to lay the murder at my door while I am actually innocent \nof it. \nI advised them that this problem cannot be solved by excitement. Let the excitement subside, \nlet us cool down; let us do away with sedition and revolt; let the country settle down into a \npeaceful atmosphere and when once a stable regime is formed and the right authority is \naccepted, then let this question be dealt with on the principles of equity and justice because \nonly then the authority will have power enough to find the criminals and to bring them to \njustice. They refused to accept my advice and said that they wanted to decide the issue on the \npoint of the sword. \nWhen they thus rejected my proposal of peace and kept on sabre rattling threats, then \nnaturally the battle, which was furious and bloody, started. When they saw defeat facing them \nacross the battlefield, when many of them were killed, and many more wounded, then they \nwent down on their knees and proposed the same thing, which I had proposed before the \nbloodshed had begun. \nI accepted their proposal so that their desire might be fulfilled, my intentions of accepting the \nprinciples of truth and justice and acting according to these principles might become clear and \nthey might have no cause to complain against me. \nNow whoever adheres firmly to the promises made will be the one whose salvation will be \nsaved by Allah and one who will try to go back upon the promises made, will fall deeper and \ndeeper into heresy, error and loss. His eyes will be closed to realities and truth in this world \nand he will be punished in the next world. \n,. .,. ,. \n,. .,. ,. \n,. .,. ,."},"hash":"z2aeBMdfsv"}
