Therefore, try to avoid \nthose things of this place which please you or allure you because this world will be with you \nfor a very short time and will be of very little use to you. Do not keep your mind fully \nengrossed in mundane affairs because you know for certain that you will shortly leave this \nworld. \nBe most wary and cautious of this vicious world at times when it allures and pleases you the \nmost because it is an old trick of this world that when a man is most happy with pleasure of \nowning and possessing it, it suddenly deserts him and when a man is most confident of its \nprotection, help and love, it certainly forsakes him."},"hash":"WQ5JHRGyXt"}
