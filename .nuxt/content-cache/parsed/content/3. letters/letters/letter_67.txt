It invites people to judge his intentions and actions. ]After glorifying Allah and praising the Holy Prophet (s) let it be known to you that I am \nleaving this city either as an oppressor or oppressed, either I am revolting against the people \nor some of them have conspired to revolt against the people or against me. Whatever the case \nmay be I invite in the Name of Allah those to whom this letter reaches, to come and see for \nthemselves whether I am in the right or on the wrong. If they find me on the path of truth and \njustice they may help me and if they find that I am on the wrong then they can reason me out \nof it."},"hash":"jCttl1TER4"}
