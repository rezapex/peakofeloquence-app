But you are following in your ancestors'\nfootsteps in trying to prove falsehood to be true, in seducing people with lies and false hopes,\nin claiming a thing far above your merits and capacities and in grasping things which religion\nprohibits to you.\nThis is so because you want to escape from truth, from religion and from Allah. And you have\ndenied and refused to accept realities which, if you realize, are more important to you than\nyour own flesh and blood. These are the realities about which you have been repeatedly told\nand often been made to understand.\nNow tell me, if you disown truth and religion what will remain with you but plain and evident\napostasy and utter reprobation, and if you refuse to accept the truth as told by Allah and the\nHoly Prophet (s) what you will believe in is but foolish, superstitious and irrational fears.\nTherefore, do not give away to doubts (about the truth which Islam has proclaimed) and do\nnot be mislead by schism into blind alleys. Beware that sinful temptation has drawn heavy\ncurtains and the darkness they create in blinding you to your reason.\nI received your letter. I do not know what to think about it. To me it appears to be an idiotic\nconfusion of irrelevant ideas. Reconciliation, treaty and peace are not the things which you\nwant to offer or to accept. What your letter contains is only disjointed words and meaningless\nphrases. It has been worded by somebody who has neither knowledge nor reasoning, who can\nneither offer anything nor invite an offer.\nBy writing such an idiotic letter you have placed yourself in the position of a man who has\nbeen stuck in a sack or one who is groping his way in darkness.\nIt will be a great misfortune for Muslims if you become their despotic ruler after me, be it the\nwhole Islamic State or any small part of it. May Allah protect them in such a calamity. Allah\nforbids that I appoint you a governor of any province or willingly allow you to control\ndestinies of Muslims of any part of the State.\nBe reasonable and act rationally because if you miss this chance you will find yourself in a\nvery serious situation when faithful Muslims attack you and what can be accepted of you\ntoday will not then be acceptable."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3. letters:letters:letter_75.md","_source":"content","_file":"3. letters/letters/letter_75.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"hKMif5ZeAd"}
