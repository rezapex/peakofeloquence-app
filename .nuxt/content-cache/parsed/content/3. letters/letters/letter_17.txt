Do not be so disappointed and discouraged with a withdrawal \nor a defeat as to be unfit for a come back and a resumption of activities. Be bold, be \ncourageous and allow your swords to do their duties and to justify your existence. \nAttack your enemies furiously and bravely and let them feel the full might of your arms and \nyour hands. Impel and drive yourselves towards a dauntless and heroic courage and towards \ndaring and undismayed use of your armaments. Do not shout but attack with eyes fixed on \nevery movement of your enemy because you will thus dispel nervousness and cowardice. \nI swear by the Lord Who allowed a seed to germinate into a plant and Who created these men \nwho are opposing and facing you and who are fighting against you who did not embrace \nIslam but for securing a safety device for their lives and properties. \nThey were not sincere in embracing Islam. It was done simply to provide for themselves a \nplace in the growing and expanding power and position of the Islamic State. They would keep \ntheir paganism hidden to their hearts until they found their supporters and helpers. Only then \nthey would come out openly."},"hash":"826mBWl4m3"}
