Muhammad, (may his soul rest in peace), died as a martyr and Egypt has fallen in \nthe hands of the enemies. I beseech the Reward of Allah for the sorrow I feel and the grief I \nsuffer on account of the martyrdom of this young man who was like a son to me. He loved \nme. He was faithful to me. So far as the defense of the Islamic State is concerned he was like \na sharp sword and an impregnable fort. \nLong before this deplorable event I had issued orders to the Heads of various provinces and to \nthe people of Kufa to reach him or send help to him when he calls for it. I had repeated these \norders. Some went to his help but half-heartedly, others started submitting excuses, while \nsome sent false reports of important engagements and did not co-operate with him. \nI feel disgusted and pray to Allah to relieve me of the society of such faithless and worthless \npeople. \nI swear by Allah that had I no desire of dying as a martyr, and had I not been ready for my \ndeath awaiting night and day, I would not have liked to live amongst them even for a day and \nI would not have come out with them to fight against the enemies of Allah and Islam."},"hash":"JUSrqDJgMX"}
