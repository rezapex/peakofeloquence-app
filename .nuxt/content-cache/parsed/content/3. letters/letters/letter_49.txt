I am quite satisfied with your work and I neither doubt your honesty nor \ndo I consider you to be inefficient and blameworthy. \nCome to me immediately. The fact is that I have resolved to face the Syrian tyrants and \noppressors and I want you to be with me because you are one of those men whom I can trust \nto help me in facing the enemies of Allah and in the establishment of the Islamic State."},"hash":"RHMsIOmv8i"}
