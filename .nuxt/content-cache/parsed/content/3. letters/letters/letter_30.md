Be kind and considerate with them. Meet them\ncheerfully. Be fair, just and impartial in your dealings so that even the influential persons may\nnot dare take undue advantage of your leniency and the commoners and the poor may not be\ndisappointed in your justice and fair dealings.\nO creature of Allah! Remember that the Almighty Lord is going to take an account of\neveryone of your sins, major or minor and whether committed openly or secretly.\nIf He punishes you for your sins, it will not be an act of tyranny and if He forgives you it will\nbe because of His Great Mercy and Forgiveness.\nO creature of Allah! Remember that pious persons passed away from this world after having\nled a respectable and fruitful life and they are going to be well-rewarded in the next world\n(when compared with the worldly-minded people they had equal opportunities of gathering\nfruits of this world and utilized them to the best of their abilities and at the same time kept\naway from all wicked and vicious ways of life). They did not jeopardize their salvation like\nworldly-minded persons. They led a more contented, more respectable and happier life than\nthose who lived wickedly.\nThey enjoyed the fruits of their labours and they had more gratifying, sober and healthy\nexperience of the pleasures of life than the rich and the wealthy. They regaled themselves\nwith the joys, the facilities and the bliss of this world as much as the tyrant and vicious people\ndesired to enjoy.\nYet while leaving this world they carried with them all that would be of use to them in the\nnext world. While living in this world they enjoyed the happiness of relinquishing its evil\nways.\nThey made themselves sure that in the life to come they will be recipient of His Grace and\nBlessings, their requests will not be turned down and the favours destined for them in\nParadise will not be lessened or reduced.\nO creature of Allah! Fear the inevitable and unavoidable death which is so near to everybody.\nBe prepared to meet it. Verily, it will come as the most important and the greatest event of\nyour life; it will either carry unmixed blessings and rewards for you or it will bring in its wake\npunishments, sufferings, and eternal damnation. There will be no chance of its lessening or\nredemption or any change for the better.\nIt is for you to decide whether to proceed towards perpetual peace and blessings - Paradise, or\ntowards eternal damnation - the Hell. Remember that life is actually driving you towards\ndeath which will meet you if you are ready to face it and which will follow you like a shadow\nif you try to run away from it.\nDeath is with you as if it has been twisted and tied round your head in between your hair and\nlife is being rolled away from behind you with each exhalation of your breath, never to be\nunrolled.\nBe afraid of the fire - the Hell, whose depth is fathomless whose intensity is enormous and\nwhere new kinds of punishments are constantly being introduced. The Hell is an abode where\nthere is no place for His Mercy and Blessings.\nPrayers of those who are thrown there will neither be heard nor accepted and there will not be\nany lessening in their sufferings and sorrows.\nIf it is possible for you to be sincerely afraid of Allah as well as have sincere faith in His\nJustice, Mercy and Love of His creatures, then try to hold these two beliefs firmly because a\nman entertains and cherishes the love, reverence and veneration of Allah in proportion to His\nfear and awe that develops in his mind.\nVerily, among men he who fully believes in His Justice and is afraid of it, as well as likes it\nexpects the best rewards from Allah.\nO Muhammad, son of Abu Bakr! Remember that I have entrusted you with the command of\nthe most important section of my army which is Egyptian. Do not allow your whims and\npassions to overrun your judgement. Keep on guarding and defending your religion and the\nState given under your trust. Take care that not for a single moment in your life, you incur the\nWrath of Allah, to gain the pleasure of any person.\nRemember that the Pleasure of Allah can substitute the pleasure of everybody else and it will\nbe the most beneficial substitute for you but His Pleasure cannot be substituted by anything.\nOffer your prayers on time, do not rush through them, and never delay in offering them.\nRemember that piety and nobleness of all your activities are subject to sincerity and\npunctuality of your prayers.\nRemember that a true Imam and leader cannot be equal to the one who leads humanity\ntowards wickedness and vice and eventually towards Hell nor can there be an equality\nbetween a follower of the Holy Prophet (s) and his sworn enemy.\nRemember the Holy Prophet (s) said that so far as his followers are concerned he was not\nafraid of encroachments upon any true Muslim by a heathen because Allah will protect every\ntrue Muslim from evil deeds on account of the sincerity of his faith and He will expose and\navert the evils introduced by heathens, but he (the Holy Prophet (s)) felt anxious about the\nactivities of hypocrites among Muslims, activities of those outwardly wise and learned people\nwho loudly proclaimed greatness and virtues of their good deeds but who secretly indulged in\nvices and sins."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3. letters:letters:letter_30.md","_source":"content","_file":"3. letters/letters/letter_30.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"eE3r3jZkw9"}
