Trust those who have proved themselves faithful. Do not trust and do not count \nupon the help of those who have proved faithless and disloyal. Remember that the absence of \nthose who do not join us willingly and sincerely is better than their presence in our ranks, and \ntheir inactivity and lethargy is better than their participation in our activities."},"hash":"ZYMV2XazBY"}
