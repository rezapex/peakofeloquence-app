For sometime he attached himself to \nImam Ali (a) pretending to be his sincere follower. The ulterior motive behind this was to \namass wealth and to grasp power. Imam Ali (a) had appointed him as the Governor of \nAzarbaijan. He started collecting and procuring wealth by every means possible. When this \nwas reported to Imam Ali (a), he wrote the following letter to Ash'ath: On receipt of this letter \nhe wanted to abscond with the wealth so amassed but good counsels prevailed upon him and \nhe was persuaded by Hujr bin Adi Kindi to got to Imam Ali (a). When his accounts were \naudited he had to surrender 400,000 dirhams. ]Verily, you have neither been entrusted with the governorship so that you amass wealth nor is \nit a tasty and juicy morsel to be swallowed up. On the contrary it is a trust committed to your \ncare and trust. Its responsibility lies upon your shoulders. \nYour Amir (meaning Imam Ali himself) has appointed you as a shepherd and a guardian of \nthe people. You have no right to do as you like and to act independently without seeking his \nadvice and permission. In all important affairs of the State and the public, your decisions must \nbe based on true facts and sound reasons. In your control and custody there is one of the \ntreasuries of Allah, you are only a treasurer, you have no right to make personal use of any \npart of this wealth, it is your duty to pass it on to whom it belongs. \nI hope you will not give me a chance to prove myself a hard task-master and a harsh \nadministrator. May you see the light."},"hash":"URkEt11RPn"}
