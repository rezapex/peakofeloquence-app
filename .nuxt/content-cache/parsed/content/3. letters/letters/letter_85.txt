Waqidi has quoted this letter in his book, al-Jamal. ]After glorifying Allah and praising the Holy Prophet (s) be it known to you that you very well \nknow my attitude towards your tribe, why in the beginning I fought against you all in the \ndefense of Islam and how and why later on I kept myself aloof from you and from your \nactivities; I had no concern about your tribe till there took place the incident which could not \nbe prevented. It is a long story and much has been said and is being said about it. However, \nthat was to be. Now you take the oath of allegiance to me from the people of your province \nand come on deputation to me."},"hash":"2drlN0Kpd4"}
