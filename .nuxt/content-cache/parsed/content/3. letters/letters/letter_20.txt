Remember also that the worst descendant is one who follows in the footstep of his \nancestor in the way of paganism, hypocrisy and Hell. \nWe (Bani Hashim) still own the glory of prophethood (having the Holy Prophet (s) from \namongst us). Prophethood which brought equality to mankind by lowering the position of \nmighty and despotic lords and raising the status of oppressed and humiliated persons. When \nAllah willed the Arabs to embrace Islam, in large numbers they entered its fold willingly or \nreluctantly. \nDuring the days when those who had precedence in embracing Islam were receiving the \nBlessings of the Lord for this precedence or when those who, on account of unbearable \nsufferings from the hands of your clan, were forced to migrate from Makkah, you and your \nfamily were after wealth and power. \nSome of you embraced Islam to better your position because Muslims were gaining \nascendancy and supremacy and some others became Muslims because after having harmed \nand wronged the Muslims in the early days of Islam, you felt that the only way to protect \nyourself from their vengeance was to profess their religion, though outwardly and \nhypocritically. \nFear Allah and do not let Satan influence your mind and body and do not give it a way into \nyour soul."},"hash":"zoLXaxIUtA"}
