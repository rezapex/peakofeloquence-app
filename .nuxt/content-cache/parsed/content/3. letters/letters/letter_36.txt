I have forgiven the offenders and I do not want to punish those whose once faced me in \nthe battlefield and then fled. I have accepted the excuses of those who came back to me \nrepenting. \nIf you again do what you have done once before, if you readopt schism and if once again \nadvice of unwise and wicked people drives you towards animosity against Islam, then \nremember, I shall chastise you. I shall invade you at the head of my army. \nIf you compel me to that then remember that this invasion will be such that the Battle of \nJamal will look like a child's play when compared to it. \nI know you all and appreciate the sincerity of those who are faithful to me and the excellence \nof those who come to me with their sincere advice and good wishes. \nI am willing to forgive and to forget those who have wronged me and to requite those who \nhave exhibited fidelity towards me."},"hash":"UQhEYxApBS"}
