I did not extend my hands towards them\nso that they might swear the oath of allegiance to me but they themselves extended their\nhands towards me. And you two were among those who had flocked around me to swear the\noath.\nYou all came to me to take the oath not because you were afraid of my power to oppress or\ntyrannize you, nor did you expect any monetary gain from me. If you two had taken the oath\nof allegiance of your own free will and without any compulsion, then do not break this oath,\ncome back to it, repent before Allah of your having broken the oath. And if your action of\nswearing the oath of allegiance was not a sincere act done with pleasure and free-will, then\nyour behaviour of pretending obedience and fidelity in the beginning and revolting against me\nat a later time does not speak well of your character and which serves as an argument in my\nfavour and against you.\nUpon my life you had no more pressing need than other Muhajirs to hide your real intentions\nfrom me and to hypocritically pretend fidelity and allegiance. In fact there was more\njustification then for you not to swear the oath of allegiance and not to offer your fidelity than\nto go back upon your oath and promise now.\nYou two were wealthy people and had your clans to support and back you. Those clans were\nthen as they are now, powerful tribes. You were not forced to come and take the oath. Do you\nknow what made you then behave like a hypocrite and now like a freed-slave? They were\nyour ulterior motives.\nYou are telling people that I am responsible for the murder of Caliph Uthman. To bear\nwitness to the fact as to who is responsible for the murder of the Caliph, you two or I, there\nare people in Madina, who are impartial. They have never sided you or me and have kept\nthemselves aloof from me from the very beginning. Shall we ask their opinion as to who is\nresponsible for this assassination? Their opinion will settle the question once and for all, will\nlay the responsibility on proper shoulders and will disclose the part each one of us has played\nof helping the caliph as much as possible or exciting the people against him and aiding and\nabetting the murder.\nMy respected friends! Give up your present attitude though I know that by declaring the\nfalsity of your position today you stand the chance of being ridiculed and disgraced yet by\npersisting in your wrong and wicked attitude you will tomorrow certainly earn the disgrace in\nthis world as well as the punishment in the next."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3. letters:letter_63.md","_source":"content","_file":"3. letters/letter_63.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"bAavwEQijq"}
