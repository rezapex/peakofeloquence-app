I\nhave no need of his pledge now. His is a Jewish hand!1 If he were to\npledge allegiance to me with his hand, he would break it the next moment\nwith wind from his arse.2 One day, he will rule, but his rule will only\nlast for as long as it takes a dog to lick its snout.3 He will also\nfather four rams.4 At his hand and theirs, Muslims will encounter bloody\ndeath! 1.71 From ʿAlī's address to the Shūrā Council when they resolved\nto pledge allegiance to ʿUthmān as the next caliph:5\nYouknowfullwellthatIhavemorerighttothecaliphatethananyoneelse.Iwill\nconcede---but, by God, I will continue to do so only for as long as the\nconcerns of the Muslims remain unharmed, as long as the injustice is\ndirected solely at me. I do so in the hope of God's reward and\nrecompense and in distaste for the adornments and splendors for which\nyou vie. 1.72 From ʿAlī's address when he heard reports that the\nUmayyads were accusing him of complicity in ʿUthmān's killing: 1 The\nhand is singled out for mention because a handclasp in that society\nsealed one's pledge of allegiance to a ruler. \"A Jewish hand\" presumably\nrefers to the pledge given to the Prophet and then broken by the Medinan\nJewish tribes. For a summary of Jews in the Qurʾan and early traditional\nMuslim historical works, see Stillman, \"Yahūd,\"ei2. 2 Lit. \"he would\ndeceive with his arse\" (la-ghadara bi-sabbatihi). The commentators\ngenerally read this phrase metaphorically to denote strong censure and\nderision, but some also read it literally: Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd says it was\ncommon practice among the Arabs for a man to break wind upon resolving\nto break a pledge (!), and Rāwandī notes that \"to insult\" (sabbahū)\nliter- ally means to pierce in the buttocks with a spear. Ḥ6:147; B 302;\nR 1:302. 3 Marwān (r. 64--65/684--685) became caliph after the last\nSufyanid-Umayyad caliph, Muʿāwi-\nyahii,andhisreignlastedbetweensixandtenmonths.Cf.Bosworth,\"Marwānib.al-Ḥakam,\"\nei2. 4 The \"four rams\" are said to be either (1) Marwān's sons: ʿAbd\nal-Malik (caliph, r. 65--86/685-- 705), and ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz, Bishr, and\nMuḥammad, who ruled respectively as governors of Egypt, Iraq, and the\nArabian Peninsula; or (2) Marwān's grandsons through ʿAbd al-Malik, the\nonly four brothers to rule as caliph: Walīd (r. 86--96/705--715),\nSulaymān (r. 96--99/715--717), Yazīd (r. 101--105/720--724), and Hishām\n(r. 105--125/724--723). B 302; R 1:306--307; Ḥ6:147--148. 5 ʿAlī\ndelivered this address in Medina following ʿUmar's death in 23/644; I\nhave added the words \"the Shūrā Council\" for clarity. Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd\nalso notes ʿAlī's citation at this time of several well-known hadith,\nincluding, ⟨For whomsoever I am master, ʿAlī is his master⟩, ⟨You are to\nme as Aaron was to Moses⟩, ⟨You are my brother in this world and the\nnext⟩--- the Shiʿa consider these hadith proof of the Prophet's\nappointment of ʿAlī as his successor.
