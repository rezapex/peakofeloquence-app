He may have\nbeen overcome in words, but he was never overcome in silence---he was\nmore eager to listen than to speak. If two options presented themselves\nto him, he would look to see which appealed to his passions and do the\nopposite.You, too, should emulate these character traits. Stay with\nthem, race to acquire them. If you cannot do them all, then know that\ndoing a little is better than renouncing a lot. 3.276 Even if\ndisobedience were not subject to punishment, you should never disobey\nGod, in gratitude for his many blessings. 3.277 Offering condolences to\nal-Ashʿath ibn Qays on the death of his son, ʿAlī said:1 Ashʿath, it is\nfitting that you mourn your son---his relationship to you makes it right\nthat you should mourn. But if you can bear his loss with fortitude, know\nthis: you can find consolation for every loss in God. Ashʿath, if you\nbear your affliction with fortitude, fate will have assailed you, yes,\nbut you will be rewarded, whereas if you break down in shock, fate will\nhave assailed you any- way, and you will be punished.Your son's life\nmade you happy, but he was a trial for you then and a test.2 His death\nhas caused you grief, but it is a means for you now to earn God's mercy\nand reward. 3.278 ʿAlī spoke these lines at the Messenger of God's\ngrave, just after burying him:3 Patience is beautiful except in our loss\nof you. Shock is loathsome except in our loss of you. The calamity\nbrought by your death is enormous, while deaths before and after you\nmean nothing. 3.279 Don't spend time with a fool. He will lure you to\nhis ways and try to turn you into him. 1 See also ʿAlī's expressions of\ncondolence to Ashʿath on the death of his brother in §3.89, and to an\nunnamed relative, in §3.385. Abū al-ʿAtāhiyah paraphrased this theme in\na line of con- dolence, \"You will no doubt be subject to the flow of\ndestiny, and either you will be rewarded for your response or a sinner\"\n(ولا بدّ من جريان القضاء---إمّا مثابًا وإمّا أثيما .)Ḥ19:192; not in the\npublished Dīwān. 2 Reference to Qurʾan, Taghābun 64:15. 3 In Medina,\n11/632. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera Qutbuddin -\n9789004682603 Downloaded from Brill.com 04/18/2024 04:50:51PM via Open\nAccess.

Your friends are your friend, the friend of\nyour friend, and the enemy of your enemy. Your enemies are your enemy,\nthe enemy of your friend, and the friend of your enemy. 3.282 A man bore\ndown on an enemy, putting himself in harm's way.

He was then asked, \"How will he judge them\nwhen they cannot see him?\" and he replied: Just as he feeds them though\nthey cannot see him! 3.287 Your envoy is your intellect's interpreter,\nyour letter your most effective spokesman. 3.288 A man who is afflicted,\nwhose hardship is severe, is not more in need of prayer than a man who\nhas been spared but has no guarantee of safety. 1 Ṭabarī (Tārīkh, 4:277)\nnarrates a version of this line as ʿAlī's words to a group of people in\nMed- ina who were criticizing ʿUthmān in the affair of his governor in\nKufa, Walīd ibn ʿUqbah, in 30/651. 2 The man who asked is reported to be\nSalmān al-Fārisī, presumably in Medina, before Salmān left for Iraq in\nʿUthmān's caliphate (r. 23--35/644--656).

Ṣadūq, Tawḥīd,\n368. 3 Masʿūdī (Murūj, 2:417--418) reports that a suppliant came to\nʿAlī's door, and ʿAlī instructed his son Ḥasan to fetch a dirham from\nhis mother, Fāṭimah (this would presumably be shortly before Fāṭimah\ndied, in 11/632, when Ḥasan was a young child). Ḥasan came back with her\ncaution that they had only six dirhams, which were needed to buy flour.\nʿAlī responded with the line at hand, and told Ḥasan to bring all six\ndirhams, which he proceeded to give to the beggar.The next morning, ʿAlī\nbought a camel on credit for 140 dirhams, which he then resold for 200,\nthus coming home with a profit of 60 dirhams, and he said to Fāṭimah\nthat this was a fulfilment of God's promise, ﴿منجَاءَبِالْح َ سَن َ ﴾اَ هِ لاَ\nثْمَأُرْشَعُ هَ لَ فِة «  brings one good deed shall be rewarded with ten\nof its kind» (Qurʾan, Anʿām 6:160).

Anas wanted to evade this task, and he came\nback to ʿAlī, saying, \"I forgot what it was I had heard.\" ʿAlī\nexclaimed:1 If you are lying, may God mar your face with a bright white\npatch that your turban cannot conceal! Raḍī: He meant vitiligo (baraṣ).\nShortly thereafter, Anas contracted this disease, and was never seen\nthereafter without a veil on his face. 3.298 Hearts are sometimes\nreceptive and sometimes withdrawn. When they are receptive, urge them to\nthe supplementary rites of worship. When they are withdrawn, let them\nstay with the mandatory rites.2 3.299 The Qurʾan contains reports about\nwhat happened before you, prophe- cies about what will come after you,\nand laws about what is present among you.3 3.300 Cast back the stone to\nwhence it came. Only evil repels evil. 1 Some commentators (R 3:390; B\n1000) say that this line, with Raḍī's contextualization, refers to\nʿAlī's sending Anas to Ṭalḥah and Zubayr before the Battle of the Camel\noutside Basra in 36/656, to remind them of Muḥammad's prophetic warning,\n⟨You will fight ʿAlī in battle, and you will be in the\nwrong.⟩Disagreeing with the etymology, Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd (19:217--218,\ncit- ing Ibn Qutaybah, Maʿārif, chapter on vitiligo, baraṣ) says the\nhistories do not report that ʿAlī ever sent Anas to speak with Ṭalḥah\nand Zubayr. Rather, they report that ʿAlī once called out to people in\nthe gathering space of Kufa (sometime during his caliphate between\n36/656 and 40/661), and said, \"Whoever has heard God's Messenger say\nabout me, while he was returning\nfromtheFarewellPilgrimage,⟨ForwhomsoeverIammaster,ʿAlīishismaster;God,lovethose\nwho love him, and hate those who hate him⟩, I ask him in God's name to\nstep forward and testify!\" Some men stepped forward and testified that\nthey had been present and heard. ʿAlī said to Anas, \"You were there too!\nWhat is the matter with you?\" Anas replied, \"Commander of the Faithful,\nI have grown old, and what I have forgotten is more than what I\nremember.\" It was then that ʿAlī spoke the lines in the text above. 2\nSimilar to §3.177. 3 Masʿūdī (Murūj, 3:106) reports that Ḥārith\nal-Hamdānī complained to ʿAlī that people had forsaken the Qurʾan and\nwere following specious hadith. ʿAlī replied that the Prophet had\ninformed him about upcoming seditions and instructed that people should\ncleave in such times to the Qurʾan, and the saying at hand is from the\nProphet's words that ʿAlī quoted. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and\nTahera Qutbuddin - 9789004682603 Downloaded from Brill.com 04/18/2024\n04:50:51PM via Open Access.

Your lettering will then be beautiful. 3.302 I am the queen\nbee of the believers.1 Money is the queen bee of the depraved. Raḍī:\nThis means that while the depraved follow money, believers follow me,\njust as honeybees follow the queen. The \"queen bee (yaʿsūb)\" is the\nleader of the honeybees. 3.303 A Jew taunted ʿAlī, \"Hardly had you\nburied your Prophet, when you fell into dis- agreement!\" and ʿAlī\nretorted: We disagreed after him, not about him. But your feet had not\ndried from the sea when you demanded of your Prophet, «\"Make for us a\ngod like their gods!\" whereby he castigated you saying, \"you are an\nignorant people!\"»2 3.304 ʿAlī was asked, \"What force did you use to\noverthrow your adversaries?\" and he replied: I never met a man who\ndidn't help me against himself! Raḍī: ʿAlī is alluding to the terror he\nwould strike deep into their hearts. 3.305 ʿAlī counseled his son\nMuḥammad ibn al-Ḥanafiyyah: My dear son, I fear for you if you ever fall\ninto poverty, so ask God to protect you from it. Poverty harms the\nfaith, bewilders the mind, and incites to malice. 3.306 ʿAlī replied\nthus to a man who asked him about a complicated matter:3 Ask to\nunderstand, not to challenge. An ignorant man who seeks knowledge is\nalmost like the learned, whereas a learned man who is overly aggressive\nis almost an ignoramus. 1 ʿIzz al-Dīn Ibn al-Athīr (Usd, 5:287) states\nthat the Prophet made this statement about ʿAlī. 2 Qurʾan, Aʿrāf 7:138.\n3 In Kufa, to a man named Ibn al-Kawwāʾ,who laterbecame one of the\nleaders of the Kharijites.

But if I decide against\nit, then you will need to obey. 3.308 It is related that when ʿAlī\narrived in Kufa from Ṣiffīn, he passed by the lodg- ings of the Shibām\nclan and heard women weeping loudly over their fallen warriors. One of\ntheir leaders, Ḥarb ibn Shuraḥbīl al-Shibāmī, came out to greet ʿAlī,\nwho said to him:2 Do your women rule you? What is this I hear---can't\nyou stop their wailing? Ḥarb then began to walk alongside ʿAlī, who was\non horseback, and ʿAlī said to him: Go back inside! A man like you,\nwalking beside a man like me, bodes nothing but sedition for the ruler\nand shame for the believer.3 3.309 FollowingtheBattleof\nNahrawān,ʿAlīwalkedoutamongtheKharijites'corpses, and he addressed them\nas follows:4 What misfortune you have earned!

Ibn al- ʿAbbās also advised ʿAlī to reaffirm Muʿāwiyah as governor\nof Damascus, and then, when Muʿāwiyah had pledged allegiance, to affirm\nhim if he continued to obey, and replace him if he stirred up dissent.\nʿAlī exclaimed, \"Great God!

But if you can bear his loss with fortitude, know\nthis: you can find consolation for every loss in God. Ashʿath, if you\nbear your affliction with fortitude, fate will have assailed you, yes,\nbut you will be rewarded, whereas if you break down in shock, fate will\nhave assailed you any- way, and you will be punished.Your son's life\nmade you happy, but he was a trial for you then and a test.2 His death\nhas caused you grief, but it is a means for you now to earn God's mercy\nand reward. 3.278 ʿAlī spoke these lines at the Messenger of God's\ngrave, just after burying him:3 Patience is beautiful except in our loss\nof you. Shock is loathsome except in our loss of you. The calamity\nbrought by your death is enormous, while deaths before and after you\nmean nothing. 3.279 Don't spend time with a fool. He will lure you to\nhis ways and try to turn you into him. 1 See also ʿAlī's expressions of\ncondolence to Ashʿath on the death of his brother in §3.89, and to an\nunnamed relative, in §3.385.

Anas wanted to evade this task, and he came\nback to ʿAlī, saying, \"I forgot what it was I had heard.\" ʿAlī\nexclaimed:1 If you are lying, may God mar your face with a bright white\npatch that your turban cannot conceal!

Only evil repels evil. 1 Some commentators (R 3:390; B\n1000) say that this line, with Raḍī's contextualization, refers to\nʿAlī's sending Anas to Ṭalḥah and Zubayr before the Battle of the Camel\noutside Basra in 36/656, to remind them of Muḥammad's prophetic warning,\n⟨You will fight ʿAlī in battle, and you will be in the\nwrong.⟩Disagreeing with the etymology, Ibn Abī al-Ḥadīd (19:217--218,\ncit- ing Ibn Qutaybah, Maʿārif, chapter on vitiligo, baraṣ) says the\nhistories do not report that ʿAlī ever sent Anas to speak with Ṭalḥah\nand Zubayr. Rather, they report that ʿAlī once called out to people in\nthe gathering space of Kufa (sometime during his caliphate between\n36/656 and 40/661), and said, \"Whoever has heard God's Messenger say\nabout me, while he was returning\nfromtheFarewellPilgrimage,⟨ForwhomsoeverIammaster,ʿAlīishismaster;God,lovethose\nwho love him, and hate those who hate him⟩, I ask him in God's name to\nstep forward and testify!\" Some men stepped forward and testified that\nthey had been present and heard. ʿAlī said to Anas, \"You were there too!\nWhat is the matter with you?\" Anas replied, \"Commander of the Faithful,\nI have grown old, and what I have forgotten is more than what I\nremember.\" It was then that ʿAlī spoke the lines in the text above. 2\nSimilar to §3.177. 3 Masʿūdī (Murūj, 3:106) reports that Ḥārith\nal-Hamdānī complained to ʿAlī that people had forsaken the Qurʾan and\nwere following specious hadith. ʿAlī replied that the Prophet had\ninformed him about upcoming seditions and instructed that people should\ncleave in such times to the Qurʾan, and the saying at hand is from the\nProphet's words that ʿAlī quoted. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and\nTahera Qutbuddin - 9789004682603 Downloaded from Brill.com 04/18/2024\n04:50:51PM via Open Access.

Poverty harms the\nfaith, bewilders the mind, and incites to malice. 3.306 ʿAlī replied\nthus to a man who asked him about a complicated matter:3 Ask to\nunderstand, not to challenge.

But if I decide against\nit, then you will need to obey. 3.308 It is related that when ʿAlī\narrived in Kufa from Ṣiffīn, he passed by the lodg- ings of the Shibām\nclan and heard women weeping loudly over their fallen warriors. One of\ntheir leaders, Ḥarb ibn Shuraḥbīl al-Shibāmī, came out to greet ʿAlī,\nwho said to him:2 Do your women rule you? What is this I hear---can't\nyou stop their wailing? Ḥarb then began to walk alongside ʿAlī, who was\non horseback, and ʿAlī said to him: Go back inside! A man like you,\nwalking beside a man like me, bodes nothing but sedition for the ruler\nand shame for the believer.3 3.309 FollowingtheBattleof\nNahrawān,ʿAlīwalkedoutamongtheKharijites'corpses, and he addressed them\nas follows:4 What misfortune you have earned! The one who deceived you\nis the one who injured you. Asked, \"Who deceived them, Commander of the\nFaithful?\" he answered: Satan the great deceiver and their own\nevil-inciting passions. The two together deceived them with false hopes,\nopened their path to sin, promised them con- quest and victory, and then\npitched them into hellfire. 3.310 Beware of disobeying God in private,\nfor the witness is himself the judge. 1 When the Muslims had pledged\nallegiance to ʿAlī in 35/656 in Medina, ʿAbdallāh ibn al-ʿAbbās advised\nhim to appoint Ṭalḥah as governor of Basra and Zubayr as governor of\nKufa. Ibn al- ʿAbbās also advised ʿAlī to reaffirm Muʿāwiyah as governor\nof Damascus, and then, when Muʿāwiyah had pledged allegiance, to affirm\nhim if he continued to obey, and replace him if he stirred up dissent.\nʿAlī exclaimed, \"Great God! Should I corrupt my faith with another's\nworldliness!\" then spoke the lines in our text. F 452; B 1004; Ṭabarī,\nTārīkh 4:441. 2 In 37/657.
