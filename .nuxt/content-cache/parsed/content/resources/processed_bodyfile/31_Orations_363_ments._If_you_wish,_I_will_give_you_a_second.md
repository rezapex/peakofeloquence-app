Moses beseeched, «My Lord,\nI am in dire need of whatever you may bestow!»1 By God, Moses asked God\nfor nothing more than a piece of bread, for he had only wild plants to\neat. He was so thin, his flesh so pared, that the green of the plants he\nhad eaten shone through the translucent skin of his stomach. If you\nwish, I will give you a third example, that of David, he with the\nPsalms, reciter for the people of paradise. David would plait palm\nfronds with his own two hands and say to his associates, \"Who will sell\nthese for me?\" then he would eat a coarse loaf of barley purchased with\nits sale. And if you wish, I will also tell you about Jesus, son of\nMary. Jesus would use a rock for a pillow and wear rough garments. His\nfood was hunger, his lamp at night the moon, his shelter in the winter\nthe sun's rays from East and West, his fruit and his fragrance the\nplants grown by the earth for the beasts. He had no wife to distract\nhim, no son to grieve him, no wealth to occupy him, no greed to bring\nhim low. His mount was his own two feet, his servant his own two hands.\n1.158.4 People,followtheexampleof yourownvirtuousandpureProphet.Any who\nlook for an exemplar can find one in him.

Of all his servants, God loves most the one who\nfollows the example of his Prophet, who walks in his footsteps.The\nProphet took the small- est morsel from the world, he never gave the\nworld a full glance. His waist was the most emaciated, his stomach the\nemptiest of worldly things.The world was offered to him, but he refused.\nHe knew that God hated it, so he hated it too.

People, if our only faults are love for what God hates and\nexaltation of what he considers paltry, they would be sufficient to\ncount as opposition to God and challenge to his command! The Prophet\nused to eat on the ground and sit like a servant. He used to mend his\nsandals with his own hands. He used to patch his garments with his own\nhands. He used to ride an unsaddled donkey, not even alone, but with\nsomeone often sitting behind him. A curtain with images was hung on the\ndoor of his home, and he said to one of his wives, ⟨Remove it from my\nsight---it reminds me of the world and its ornaments!⟩He turned his\nheart away from the world, he suppressed its mention in his heart, he\npre- ferred that its adornments be removed from his eyes, so that he\nwould not to be seduced by its soft luxuries or led to view it as a\nlasting home or permanent residence.

Someone said to me, \"Why\ndon't you throw it away?\" and I replied, \"Get away from me! ⟨When\nmorning comes, the night-traveler will be praised!⟩\"1 1.159 From an\noration by ʿAlī: God sent Muḥammad with brilliant light, clear proof, a\ndistinct path, and a book of guidance. His family is the best family,\nhis tree is the best tree, its branches straight and tall, its fruits\nhanging low. His birth was in Mecca, his migration was to Ṭaybah,2 from\nthere his fame rose high, and his voice spread far and wide. God sent\nMuḥammad with ample evidence, healing counsel, and an enlivening faith,3\nthrough him, he revived abandoned laws,4 crushed newfangled heresies,\nand explained decreed rules. Indeed, «whoever seeks a religion other\nthan Islam»5 will find his wretchedness real, his support bro- 1 A line\nof rajaz by the pre-Islamic poet Jumayḥibn al-Sharīd al-Taghlibī, used\nproverbially to mean that fortitude begets a praiseworthy result.

He\ndirected you to earn reward and gave complete measure. He described the\nworld to you and told you of its severance, its transience, its\ndeparture. People, turn away from everything in it that excite your\nwonder, because it will not be with you for long.This world is the\ndomicile that is closest to God's anger and farthest from his pleasure.\nServants of God, be certain of its separation and mutability, turn your\neyes away from its griefs and occupations, be true to your soul and work\nhard for it, fear the world's dealings, and learn from the generations\nbefore you that you have seen die. Their limbs fell asunder, their ears\nand eyes ceased to function, their grandeur and might were lost, their\nhappiness and joys were severed. In place of proximity to their children\nthey were given loss, in place of the companionship of spouses they were\ngiven isolation. They no longer boast, or procreate, or visit, or\nassociate. Servants of God, beware! Control your passions, restrain your\ndesires, and use your intellect! The matter is clear, the banner is\nerect, the road is compact, and the path is straightforward. 1.160 From\nan address by ʿAlī, to one of his associates who asked him, \"How is it\nthat your tribe has driven you away from this position when you are\nworthier?\" ʿAlī answered:1 You man of Asad! Your girth is loose, and you\nfire without aim!2 Still, you possess kinship through marriage, and have\nthe right to ask.3 You want to know, so I will give you an answer: The\ninjustice done to us concerning this position---when we are loftier in\nlineage and our kinship with the Messenger is closer---was an act of\namoral appropriation. Some hearts coveted it, other 1 Ṣadūq (Amālī,\n716--717) places this address at Ṣiffīn in 37/657; the speaker is a man\nfrom the Dūdān clan of Asad. \"This position\" (hādhā l-maqām), refers to\nthe caliphate; Sunni com- mentators (Ḥ2:243; also mentioned in B 543)\ninterpret the referent as the Shūrā Council who elected ʿUthmān, while\nShiʿi commentators (B 543; R 2:125) interpret the referent as ʿUthmān in\nparticular, but also Abū Bakr and ʿUmar. 2 Refers to the man's lack of\ndiscernment and his speaking out of turn.

What a great favor God has granted us,\nhaving blessed us with Muḥammad as an exemplar to follow, a commander in\nwhose footsteps to walk. By God, I too have patched my rough cloak so\noften that I am embarrassed to have it mended. Someone said to me, \"Why\ndon't you throw it away?\" and I replied, \"Get away from me! ⟨When\nmorning comes, the night-traveler will be praised!⟩\"1 1.159 From an\noration by ʿAlī: God sent Muḥammad with brilliant light, clear proof, a\ndistinct path, and a book of guidance. His family is the best family,\nhis tree is the best tree, its branches straight and tall, its fruits\nhanging low. His birth was in Mecca, his migration was to Ṭaybah,2 from\nthere his fame rose high, and his voice spread far and wide. God sent\nMuḥammad with ample evidence, healing counsel, and an enlivening faith,3\nthrough him, he revived abandoned laws,4 crushed newfangled heresies,\nand explained decreed rules. Indeed, «whoever seeks a religion other\nthan Islam»5 will find his wretchedness real, his support bro- 1 A line\nof rajaz by the pre-Islamic poet Jumayḥibn al-Sharīd al-Taghlibī, used\nproverbially to mean that fortitude begets a praiseworthy result.
