He rinsed it with water until it became pure and\nclean, and moistened and kneaded it until it was smooth and malleable.\nWith this mixture, he molded a\nformwithcurves,joints,limbs,andnodes.Heletitdryuntilithardened,setting\nit aside for a fixed period of time, until it became firm. Then he\nbreathed into it of his spirit, and it stood before him as a human\nbeing. This being had faculties it could harness, a mind it could\nengage, limbs it could yoke to its service, parts it could use as\ninstruments, and perception with which it could differentiate between\nright and wrong, tastes and smells, colors, and species. Its clay was a\nblend of disparate entities, assembled forms, warring opposites, and\ndissimilar mixtures: hot and cold, wet and dry, painful and joyous.\n1.1.5 Then God commanded his angels to fulfill the trust with which he\nhad charged them and discharge the covenant he had enjoined---to\nprostrate hum- bly, deferentially, before Adam, in recognition of the\nhonor he had received from God. God said, «Prostrate before Adam, and\nthey all prostrated except Iblīs»1 and Iblīs's tribe. Pride held them\nback and wretchedness took over when they boasted of their creation from\nfire and scorned the creation of clay. God gave Iblīs a respite so that\nhe could earn yet more of God's wrath, to complete\nthetrialandfulfillthepledge.Hesaid,«Youhavebeenplacedamongthosewho have\nbeen grantedrespiteuntil the dayof destiny.»2 Asfor Adam,God gavehim a\nhome, with a good life therein and a safe dwelling. He warned him of\nIblīs and of Iblīs's enmity. Iblīs misled Adam, for he was jealous of\nAdam's heavenly abode and pious companions. Adam was deceived---he\nexchanged certainty for doubt and resolve for weakness, his bliss was\nreplaced by fear, his decep- tion was followed by regret. Afterward, God\naccepted his plea for forgiveness, spoke words of mercy, and promised\nhim a return to paradise, but he never- theless cast Adam into the abode\nof tribulation, where his descendants would multiply for generations.\n1.1.6 FromAdam'sdescendants,Godselectedprophets,exactingapledgefrom\nthemtoconveyhisrevelation,andentrustingthemwithdeliveringhismessage. As\ntime passed, most people altered God's covenant, denied what they owed\nhim, and ascribed partners to him.

He directed his prophets to remind people of the\ndivine favors they had forgotten, establish the truth by conveying his\nmessage, and revive their numbed intellects. He instructed his prophets\nto show people the signs of his power: the sky raised above, and the\nearth spread below, livelihoods that sustained life, and lifespans that\nended in death, suffering that made people age, and relentless\ncalamities. Never in all this time did God allow his creation to be left\nwithout a prophet, a revealed scripture, a sure proof, or a clear path.\nThe scanty number who answered did not stop God's messengers, nor the\nmul- titudes of their repudiators. Each messenger had his successor\nnamed for him, each successor was identified by his predecessor. In this\nmanner, generations went by, and ages passed. Fathers died, and sons\ntook their place. 1.1.7 So it was, until God sent Muḥammad to fulfill\nhis promise and complete the line of prophecy. All earlier prophets had\nbeen made to affirm Muḥammad, whose qualities had been made known to\nthem, with a binding oath. His birth, when it came, brought auspicious\nblessings. At that time, the earth's inhabi- tants were divided into\nnumerous faiths with different notions and divergent views. One group\nlikened God to his creatures, another rejected his name, and a third\nlooked to a separate deity. Through Muḥammad, God saved the peo- ple\nfrom their errant ways. Because of his eminence, he delivered them from\nignorance. Then God summoned Muḥammad to meet with him and desired for\nhim the blessings to be enjoyed at his side. Raising him from the\nvileness of this worldly abode and lifting him from this place of\ntribulation, God brought him into his presence, honored and esteemed.\nFor you, he left you what earlier prophets left their communities, they\ndid not abandon their followers without guidance, without a clear path\nor a signpost. Muḥammad, too, left you your Lord's Book, and he fully\nelucidated its contents: the licit versus the illicit, rec- ommended\nvirtues versus required mandates, abrogating verses versus abro- gated\nones, licenses versus decrees, specifics versus generalities, lessons\nversus parables, free verses versus restricted ones, and clear verses\nversus ambiguous\nones.HeexplainedtheBook'ssubtletiesandclarifiedwhatwasobscure,includ-\ning things whose knowledge is required for all God's servants, versus\nothers, ignoranceof\nwhichisexcused;thingswhosemandateisestablishedintheBook while their\nabrogation is shown in the Sunnah, versus others whose practice is\ncommanded in the Sunnah while vacating them is permitted in the Book;\nand things that were compulsory in their time, versus others whose\ndirective subse- quently ceased. He differentiated among the Book's\nprohibitions of grave sins which incur the punishment of the Fire,\nversus smaller transgressions which hold the prospect of God's\nforgiveness; of acts acceptable in minimal form, ver- sus those that\nearn maximum reward. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera\nQutbuddin - 9789004682603 Downloaded from Brill.com 04/18/2024\n04:50:51PM via Open Access.

He directed you to\nrace to the House like cattle to water, like doves to seed,\ndemonstrating your prostration before his greatness and your submission\nto his power. He selected true listeners to answer his call, believe in\nhis word, stand in the stations of the prophets, and follow the example\nof angels who circumambulate his throne. These pilgrims obtain abundant\nprofit through their worship of him, and they speedily secure his\nforgiveness. God characterized his House as Islam's lofty banner and\nmade it a sanctuary for all who seek shelter. Mandating pilgrimage to\nit, he com- manded you to submit its due and come to it, and he decreed,\n«Pilgrimage to the House is compulsory for all who are able to find a\npath. As for those who disbelieve, they should know that God has need of\nno one from all the worlds.»1 1.2 From an oration given by ʿAlī during\nhis return from Ṣiffīn:2 1.2.1 I praise God, seeking the completion of\nhis favor, submitting to his might, and entreating his protection\nagainst sin. I beseech him, needing only his all-sufficing aid.\nWhomsoever God guides never goes astray, whomsoever he abhors never\nendures, and whomsoever he suffices never wants. His praise is the\nweightiest commodity placed on the celestial scales, and the best\ntreasure one can hoard. I testify that there is no god but God---I\nrender this testimony with firm sincerity and true belief. We, all of\nus, shall cling to it for as long as God gives us life, relying on it to\ndispel the terrors we must face, for it is the requirement of our faith\nand the key to God's gifts, it pleases the Merciful and banishes Satan.\nI testify that Muḥammad is God's servant and messenger and acknowledge\nthat God sent Muḥammad with a celebrated religion, a legacy of\nknowledge,3 a transcribed scripture, brilliant light, gleaming radiance,\nand clear command. All this, in order to remove doubts, establish\nproofs, caution with portentous signs, and warn against God's\npunishments. When Muḥam- 1 Qurʾan, Āl ʿImrān 3:97.

Right guidance was not\nrecognized, and the blindness was total. The Merciful Lord was\ndisobeyed, Satan was abetted, and faith had no support. Its pillars had\ncome crashing down, its features were distorted, its paths had fallen\ninto disre- pair, and its trails had worn away. In obedience to Satan,\npeople had followed his ways and alighted at his watering hole.With\ntheir support, his banners were raised high, and his pennants were\nunfurled. This was a time when sedition was ascendant, when people were\ncrushed by its steeds and trampled under its hooves. Enmeshed in its\nthroes, they were in a state of convulsion, lost, confused, and\nignorant. They lived in the best of abodes but with the worst of\nneighbors. They lived in a land where the learned were demeaned and the\nignorant esteemed.Here,slumber had turned intoinsomniaand kohlhadbeen\nreplaced by tears. 1.2.2 From the same oration, referring to the\nProphet's family: They are the embodiments of God's mystery, the\nfoundations of his creed, the vessels of his knowledge, the harbors for\nhis wisdom, the havens for his scrip- tures,andthepeaksof\nhisreligion.Throughthem,hestraightensreligion'sback when it becomes\ncrooked, and calms its limbs when it trembles. From the same oration,\nreferring to the hypocrites: They sowed immorality, watered it with\narrogance, and reaped perdition. No one from this community may be\ncompared to Muḥammad's family, and no one blessed by God's favors may be\nequated with them in this regard. They are the pillar of religion and\nthe column of certainty. The exaggerator must return to their position,\nand the laggard must join up with it. Theirs is the right of allegiance,\ntheirs the Prophet's testament and inheritance. Now, in this moment,\ntruth has been restored to its owners and returned to its home. 1 After\nḤ1:137.

I draped a curtain across it\nand turned my face away. I weighed two options: strike with an amputated\nhand or endure a blind dark- ness that renders adults infirm and\nchildren old, in which believers continue to brave toil and turmoil\nuntil they meet their Lord. I saw that forbearance was the judicious\nchoice. So I endured---but my eyes filled with dust and my throat choked\nas I saw my inheritance looted. 1.3.2 Thus it was, until the first went\non his way, tossing it to another after him. Then ʿAlī recited a\ntestimonial verse:2 O how different my days today, always in the saddle,\nand the days spent in the company of Jābir's brother, Ḥayyān! How\nstrange that he should wish to give it up during his lifetime yet secure\nit for another after his death! The two divided the milk from its udders\nbetween them! This next one corralled it to a stony field, where any who\nventured sus- tained deep wounds and experienced rough passage. How\noften did people stumble in this terrain, and how often did they make\nexcuses for stumbling! 1 Delivered in Raḥbah, south of Kufa, toward the\nend of ʿAlī's caliphate, in response to Ibn ʿAbbās's query about the\nProphet's succession, according to Mufīd (Irshād, 287). Sibṭ(Tadhki-\nrah, 124) states it was delivered on the pulpit of the Prophet's Mosque\nin Medina in 35/656, soon after ʿAlī was pledged allegiance as caliph,\nin response to a person calling out to him, \"What kept you back until\nnow?\", but this earlier dating is unlikely given the reference in the\nfinal section (§1.3.4) to the three groups who rebelled against him.\n\"It\" in the first line is the caliphate, and \"that man\" (lit. Ibn Abī\nfulān, \"son of so-and-so\") is Abū Bakr, the first historical caliph. The\nsecond individual (§1.3.2) is Umar, and \"the third\" (§1.3.3) is ʿUthmān;\n\"his clan\" refers to the Umayyads. This oration is controversial because\nof its political con- tent, but it is not so different from materials\nrecorded by the earliest historians: Ibn Hishām (Sīrah, 2:489--490),\nṬabarī (Tārīkh, 4:231--233, 5:7--8), Yaʿqūbī (Tārīkh, 2:126), and Ibn\nQutay- bah (Imāmah, 1:28--33), all note ʿAlī's refusal to accept Abū\nBakr as caliph until forced to do so. They also record ʿAlī's\ndeclarations about his right to the caliphate immediately after Muḥam-\nmad's death, and during the deliberations of ʿUmar's Shūrā council. For\ndetails of this issue and further primary sources, see Madelung, The\nSuccession to Muḥammad, 28--33, 141, and passim; and Madelung,\n\"S̲h̲īʿa,\"ei2.

Dear God, what\na Council! Was there doubt regarding my stature, even in comparison with\nthe first of them, that I was now being equated with these laggards! But\nI moved with them, falling when they fell and flying when they flew.\nEven so, one of them turned away from me because of an old grudge,1\nanother inclined toward someone else because he was related to him by\nmarriage,2 along with this one and that one, until the third stood up,\nbosom swelling with pride, amid his dung and fodder.

When he had finished\nreading, Ibn ʿAbbās asked, \"Commander of the Faithful, will you not\ncontinue your speech where you left off?\" \"No, Ibn ʿAbbās,\" ʿAlī\nreplied, \"that was the roar of a camel stallion that burst out then\nsubsided.\" Ibn ʿAbbās remarked, \"By God, I have never regretted the loss\nof any words as much as I regret the loss of these---if only the\nCommander of the Faithful had completed what he began!\" 1.3.6 Raḍī:\nʿAlī's words in this oration: \"Any who traversed it rode a bucking\ncamel--- tighten its rein and slit its nose, or loosen it and be\nthrown,\" mean that if the rider were to pull strongly on the reins of a\nbucking came while it pulled the other way, he would slit its nose, but\nif he were to slacken them a little, then that, coupled with the camel's\nrecalcitrance, would mean that the camel would throw him off, for he\nwould be unable to control it. It is said, \"He tightened the reins of\nthe camel mare\" (ashnaqa l-\nnāqata),whensomeonepullsbackthecamel'smuzzlewiththenose-reinandliftsitup;\nthe basic form of the verb (shanaqa) is also used---Ibn al-Sikkīt\nmentions this in Iṣlāḥ al-manṭiq (Correcting Speech). ʿAlī said, \"He\ntightened for it its reins (ashnaqa lahā)\" (using the preposition li-),1\nrather than \"He tightened its reins (ashnaqahā)\" (with the camel as\ndirect object), because he wanted to preserve the parallelism with \"if\nhe loos- ened them (aslasa lahā),\" where he also used the preposition\nli-. It is as though ʿAlī said, \"if he raised the camel's head upward\nwith the nose-rein,\" meaning that he held the camel tightly by means of\nit. 1.4 From an oration by ʿAlī:2 Through us you received guidance in\nthe dark night, mounted the camel's lofty hump, and emergedfroma\nmoonlessnight intothelight of dawn.Howdeaf are the ears that don't hear\nthe mourners' wails! Can people whom a clap of thun- der fails to awaken\nbe expected to heed a gentle voice? How calm is the heart that shudders\nin fear of God!

But I wear the robe of religion, and it has prevented\nme from harming you, though my righteous spirit showed me clearly what\nyou were. I stood up to guide you back to the trodden path of truth,\nfrom all those trails where you had wandered without a guide, where you\nhad dug for water but found none.

Cut through the waves of rebellion by boarding the\nark of salvation. Leave the path of dissension and cast off the crown of\npride. Success comes to those who rise when they have support, or yield\nand let people be. This affair resembles murky water, or a morsel that\nchokes those who swallow it. One who plucks before his time gains as\nlittle as one who plants in another's field. If I say something now,\nthey will respond, \"He covets power.\" If I remain silent, they will cry,\n\"He is afraid of being killed!\" No, indeed, ⟨not after the small\ncalamity and the large one⟩!3 By God, Abū Ṭālib's son is more\ncomfortable with death than an infant at his mother's breast! But I hold\nknowledge of mysteries.Were I to reveal them to you, you would tremble\nlike ropes hanging down deep wells. 1.6 From an address ʿAlī delivered\nwhen advised not to pursue Ṭalḥah and Zubayr or make preparations to\nfight them:4 By God, I shall not behave like the hyena that, sleeping\nthrough a prolonged barrage of pebbles, is captured by the stealthy\nhunter.5 I call on men who have 1 Refers to the Qurʾanic story of Moses\n(Qurʾan, Hūd 11:70,Ṭāhā 20:67), and compares ʿAlī's story to it. 2 In\n11/632, in Medina. Ṭabrisī (Iḥtijāj, 1:127) cites the first three lines\nas part of a note ʿAlī wrote to Abū Bakr, after he had denied Fāṭimah\nher right to inherit the orchards of Fadak. ʿAbbās ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib\nwas ʿAlī and Muḥammad's uncle. Abū Sufyān was Muʿāwiyah's father and\nMuḥammad's arch foe, before he converted to Islam following the\nProphet's conquest of Mecca. The two---ʿAbbās and Abū Sufyān---were\nclose associates. 3 Proverb signifying all sorts of calamities (etiology\nin Maydānī, Majmaʿ, 1:92), signifying that ʿAlī has faced death on the\nbattlefield throughout his life. 4 In Rabadhah, near Medina, in 36/656,\nenrouteto Iraq in the lead-up to the Battle of the Camel (Ṭabarī,\nTārīkh, 4:455--456), or in Dhū Qār, soon after arriving in Iraq (ibid.,\n4:457--458); ʿAlī's son Ḥasan is named as his interlocutor. 5 See\nsimilar phraseology in §1.146. The signification of the simile is being\nnaively unaware of danger despite ample warning. In medieval Arab lore,\nthe hyena (ḍabuʿ) is reputed to be a stupid animal. Easily tricked by\nthe hunter who throws pebbles to draw it out, it emerges from its den,\nthinking to find prey, and is killed.

He directed his prophets to remind people of the\ndivine favors they had forgotten, establish the truth by conveying his\nmessage, and revive their numbed intellects. He instructed his prophets\nto show people the signs of his power: the sky raised above, and the\nearth spread below, livelihoods that sustained life, and lifespans that\nended in death, suffering that made people age, and relentless\ncalamities. Never in all this time did God allow his creation to be left\nwithout a prophet, a revealed scripture, a sure proof, or a clear path.\nThe scanty number who answered did not stop God's messengers, nor the\nmul- titudes of their repudiators. Each messenger had his successor\nnamed for him, each successor was identified by his predecessor. In this\nmanner, generations went by, and ages passed. Fathers died, and sons\ntook their place. 1.1.7 So it was, until God sent Muḥammad to fulfill\nhis promise and complete the line of prophecy. All earlier prophets had\nbeen made to affirm Muḥammad, whose qualities had been made known to\nthem, with a binding oath. His birth, when it came, brought auspicious\nblessings. At that time, the earth's inhabi- tants were divided into\nnumerous faiths with different notions and divergent views. One group\nlikened God to his creatures, another rejected his name, and a third\nlooked to a separate deity. Through Muḥammad, God saved the peo- ple\nfrom their errant ways. Because of his eminence, he delivered them from\nignorance. Then God summoned Muḥammad to meet with him and desired for\nhim the blessings to be enjoyed at his side. Raising him from the\nvileness of this worldly abode and lifting him from this place of\ntribulation, God brought him into his presence, honored and esteemed.\nFor you, he left you what earlier prophets left their communities, they\ndid not abandon their followers without guidance, without a clear path\nor a signpost. Muḥammad, too, left you your Lord's Book, and he fully\nelucidated its contents: the licit versus the illicit, rec- ommended\nvirtues versus required mandates, abrogating verses versus abro- gated\nones, licenses versus decrees, specifics versus generalities, lessons\nversus parables, free verses versus restricted ones, and clear verses\nversus ambiguous\nones.HeexplainedtheBook'ssubtletiesandclarifiedwhatwasobscure,includ-\ning things whose knowledge is required for all God's servants, versus\nothers, ignoranceof\nwhichisexcused;thingswhosemandateisestablishedintheBook while their\nabrogation is shown in the Sunnah, versus others whose practice is\ncommanded in the Sunnah while vacating them is permitted in the Book;\nand things that were compulsory in their time, versus others whose\ndirective subse- quently ceased. He differentiated among the Book's\nprohibitions of grave sins which incur the punishment of the Fire,\nversus smaller transgressions which hold the prospect of God's\nforgiveness; of acts acceptable in minimal form, ver- sus those that\nearn maximum reward. al-Sharīf al-Raḍī (d. 406/1015) and Tahera\nQutbuddin - 9789004682603 Downloaded from Brill.com 04/18/2024\n04:50:51PM via Open Access.

He directed you to\nrace to the House like cattle to water, like doves to seed,\ndemonstrating your prostration before his greatness and your submission\nto his power. He selected true listeners to answer his call, believe in\nhis word, stand in the stations of the prophets, and follow the example\nof angels who circumambulate his throne. These pilgrims obtain abundant\nprofit through their worship of him, and they speedily secure his\nforgiveness. God characterized his House as Islam's lofty banner and\nmade it a sanctuary for all who seek shelter. Mandating pilgrimage to\nit, he com- manded you to submit its due and come to it, and he decreed,\n«Pilgrimage to the House is compulsory for all who are able to find a\npath. As for those who disbelieve, they should know that God has need of\nno one from all the worlds.»1 1.2 From an oration given by ʿAlī during\nhis return from Ṣiffīn:2 1.2.1 I praise God, seeking the completion of\nhis favor, submitting to his might, and entreating his protection\nagainst sin. I beseech him, needing only his all-sufficing aid.\nWhomsoever God guides never goes astray, whomsoever he abhors never\nendures, and whomsoever he suffices never wants. His praise is the\nweightiest commodity placed on the celestial scales, and the best\ntreasure one can hoard. I testify that there is no god but God---I\nrender this testimony with firm sincerity and true belief. We, all of\nus, shall cling to it for as long as God gives us life, relying on it to\ndispel the terrors we must face, for it is the requirement of our faith\nand the key to God's gifts, it pleases the Merciful and banishes Satan.\nI testify that Muḥammad is God's servant and messenger and acknowledge\nthat God sent Muḥammad with a celebrated religion, a legacy of\nknowledge,3 a transcribed scripture, brilliant light, gleaming radiance,\nand clear command.

Enmeshed in its\nthroes, they were in a state of convulsion, lost, confused, and\nignorant. They lived in the best of abodes but with the worst of\nneighbors.

I draped a curtain across it\nand turned my face away. I weighed two options: strike with an amputated\nhand or endure a blind dark- ness that renders adults infirm and\nchildren old, in which believers continue to brave toil and turmoil\nuntil they meet their Lord. I saw that forbearance was the judicious\nchoice. So I endured---but my eyes filled with dust and my throat choked\nas I saw my inheritance looted. 1.3.2 Thus it was, until the first went\non his way, tossing it to another after him. Then ʿAlī recited a\ntestimonial verse:2 O how different my days today, always in the saddle,\nand the days spent in the company of Jābir's brother, Ḥayyān! How\nstrange that he should wish to give it up during his lifetime yet secure\nit for another after his death! The two divided the milk from its udders\nbetween them! This next one corralled it to a stony field, where any who\nventured sus- tained deep wounds and experienced rough passage. How\noften did people stumble in this terrain, and how often did they make\nexcuses for stumbling! 1 Delivered in Raḥbah, south of Kufa, toward the\nend of ʿAlī's caliphate, in response to Ibn ʿAbbās's query about the\nProphet's succession, according to Mufīd (Irshād, 287). Sibṭ(Tadhki-\nrah, 124) states it was delivered on the pulpit of the Prophet's Mosque\nin Medina in 35/656, soon after ʿAlī was pledged allegiance as caliph,\nin response to a person calling out to him, \"What kept you back until\nnow?\", but this earlier dating is unlikely given the reference in the\nfinal section (§1.3.4) to the three groups who rebelled against him.\n\"It\" in the first line is the caliphate, and \"that man\" (lit. Ibn Abī\nfulān, \"son of so-and-so\") is Abū Bakr, the first historical caliph. The\nsecond individual (§1.3.2) is Umar, and \"the third\" (§1.3.3) is ʿUthmān;\n\"his clan\" refers to the Umayyads. This oration is controversial because\nof its political con- tent, but it is not so different from materials\nrecorded by the earliest historians: Ibn Hishām (Sīrah, 2:489--490),\nṬabarī (Tārīkh, 4:231--233, 5:7--8), Yaʿqūbī (Tārīkh, 2:126), and Ibn\nQutay- bah (Imāmah, 1:28--33), all note ʿAlī's refusal to accept Abū\nBakr as caliph until forced to do so. They also record ʿAlī's\ndeclarations about his right to the caliphate immediately after Muḥam-\nmad's death, and during the deliberations of ʿUmar's Shūrā council. For\ndetails of this issue and further primary sources, see Madelung, The\nSuccession to Muḥammad, 28--33, 141, and passim; and Madelung,\n\"S̲h̲īʿa,\"ei2. The Shiʿi commentators read the oration as proof of ʿAlī's\nimamate, while the Sunni commentators read it as an articulation of\nʿAlī's superiority over all other Companions of the Prophet.

Ṭabrisī (Iḥtijāj, 1:127) cites the first three lines\nas part of a note ʿAlī wrote to Abū Bakr, after he had denied Fāṭimah\nher right to inherit the orchards of Fadak. ʿAbbās ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib\nwas ʿAlī and Muḥammad's uncle.
