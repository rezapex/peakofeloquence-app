You have been commanded to journey and directed to\nprovision. What I fear most for you is the pursuit of desire and lengthy\nyearnings. Take provisions in this world, from this world, to nourish\nyour souls tomorrow. Raḍī: If ever words grabbed you by the neck and\ncompelled you to renounce the world and perform deeds for the hereafter,\nit would be these words, which cut the cords of false hope and ignite\nthe flint of counsel and warning. Among their most wondrous lines are,\n\"Today is the day of training and tomorrow the race: its goal is\nparadise, or its end hellfire.\" For in addition to majestic vocabulary,\nexalted themes, clear analogies, and effective metaphors, they enfold a\nwondrous secret and sublime significance in the line, \"its goal (subqah)\nis paradise, or its end (ghāyah) hellfire.\" Here, ʿAlī differentiates\nbetween the two words because they have different significations. He\ndoes not say \"its goal is hellfire\" as he says \"its goal is paradise\"\nbecause one races towards something one wants, to a prize one hopes to\nwin, and that is the description of paradise. But this significance does\nnot apply to hellfire---may God protect us from it!---so it would be\nimpermissible to say, \"its goal is hellfire.\" Rather, ʿAlī says, \"its\nend is hellfire,\" because an end is reached by those who are not pleased\nto reach it as well as by those who are pleased to reach it; it conveys\nboth situations. In the context of this sermon, the word \"end\" indicates\nthe last stop, the place of final return, as in God's words, «Say:Take\nplea- sure if you wish! Your last stop is hellfire.»1 It would be\nimpermissible to say here, \"your goal is hellfire.\" Reflect on ʿAlī's\nwords, for the signification of this saying is wondrous, its well deep.\nAnd this is true for the entirety of ʿAlī's speech. 1.29 From an oration\nby ʿAlī:2 People! You are together in body but divided in aspiration.\nYour words would shatter mighty rocks, but your actions embolden the\nenemy. In your gather- ings you say this and that, but when battle\napproaches, you yell, \"Be gone! Get away!\" A mission that depends on you\nnever succeeds. A heart that is subjected to you is never at ease.\nExcuses and falsehoods! You keep asking for a delay, like debtors who\nput off and refuse to pay! Men without honor cannot fight injus-\ntice.Rightscannotbewonexceptthroughearnesteffort.Tellme---whichhome will\nyou defend when this one is taken? Under which leader will you fight\nwhen I am gone?
