*About the two arbiters (after the battle of Siffin)*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> في معنى الحكمين

Your party had decided to select two persons, and so we took their
pledge that they would act according to the Qur\'an and would not commit
excess, that their tongues should be with it and that their hearts
should follow it. But they deviated from it, abandoned what was right
although they had it before their eyes. Wrong-doing was their desire,
and going astray was their behaviour. Although we had settled with them
to decide with justice, to act according to the light and without the
interference of their evil views and wrong judgement. Now that they have
abandoned the course of right and have come out with just the opposite
of what was settled, we have strong ground (to reject their verdict).

> فأَجْمَعَ رَأْيُ مَلَئِكمْ عَلَى أَنِ اخْتَارُوا رَجُلَيْنِ، فَأَخَذْنَا عَلَيْهِمَا أَنْ يُجَعْجِعَا عِنْدَ
> الْقُرْآنِ، ولاَ يُجَاوِزَاهُ، وَتَكُونَ أَلْسِنَتُهُما مَعَهُ وَقُلُوبُهُمَا تَبَعَهُ، فَتَاهَا عَنْهُ،
> وَتَرَكَا الْحَقَّ وَهُمَا يُبْصِرَانِهِ، وَكَانَ الْجَوْرُ هَوَاهُمَا، وَالاْعْوِجَاجُ دَأْبَهُمَا، وَقَدْ سَبَقَ
> اسْتِثْنَاؤُنَا عَلَيْهِمَا فِي الْحُكْمِ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالْعَمَلِ بِالْحَقِّ سُوءَ رَأْيِهِمَا وَجَوْرَ حُكْمِهِمَا،
> وَالثِّقَةُ فِي أَيْدِينَا لاِنْفُسِنَا، حِينَ خَالفَا سَبِيلَ الْحَقِّ، وَأَتَيَا بِمَا لاَ يُعْرَفُ مِنْ
> مَعْكُوسِ الْحُكْمِ.
