## On eligibility for the Caliphate

> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام)

> في رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم)

> ومن هو جدير بأن يكون للخلافة وفي هوان الدنيا

The Prophet (S) is the trustee of Allah\'s revelation, the Last of His
Prophets. the giver of tidings of His mercy and the warner for His
chastisement.

> أَمِينُ وَحْيِهِ، وَخَاتَمُ رُسُلِهِ، وَبَشِيرُ رَحْمَتِهِ، وَنَذِيرُ نِقْمَتِهِ.

O people! The most rightful of all persons for this matter (namely the
caliphate) is he who is most competent among them to maintain it, and he
who knows best Allah\'s commands about it. If any mischief is created by
a mischief-monger, he will be called upon to repent. If he refuses, he
will be fought.

By my life,  if the question of Imamah was not to be decided unless
all the people were present, then there would be no such case. But those
who agreed about it imposed the decision on those who were absent, so
much so that he who was present could not dissent and the one who was
absent could not choose (any one else). Know that I shall fight two
persons - one who claims what is not his and the other who ignores what
is obligatory upon him.

> أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، إنَّ أَحَقَّ النَّاسِ بِهذَا الاْمْرِ أَقْوَاهُمْ عَلَيْهِ، وَأَعْلَمُهُمْ بِأَمْرِ اللهِ
> فِيهِ، فَإِنْ شَغَبَ شَاغِبٌ اسْتُعْتِبَ، فَإِنْ أَبَى قُوتِلَ.

> وَلَعَمْرِي، لَئِنْ كَانَتِ الاْمَامَةُ لاَ تَنْعَقِدُ حَتَّى يَحْضُرَهَا عَامَّةُ النَّاسِ، \[ فـ \]مَا
> إِلَى ذلك سَبِيلٌ، وَلكِنْ أَهْلُهَا يَحْكُمُونَ عَلَى مَنْ غَابَ عَنْهَا، ثُمَّ لَيْسَ لِلشَّاهِدِ أَنْ
> يَرْجِعَ، وَلاَ لِلغَائِبِ أَنْ يَخْتَارَ. أَلاَ وَإِنَّي أُقَاتِلُ رَجُلَيْنِ: رَجُلاً ادَّعَى مَا لَيْسَ لَهُ،
> وَآخَرَ مَنَعَ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِ.

## The need for sagacity in fighting against Muslims

O creatures of Allah! I advise you to have fear of Allah because it is
the best advice to be mutually given by persons, and the best of all
things before Allah. The door of war has been opened between you and the
other Muslims. And this banner will be borne only by him who is a man of
sight, of endurance and of knowledge of the position of rightfulness.
Therefore, you should go ahead with what you are ordered and desist from
what you are refrained. Do not make haste in any matter till you have
clarified it. For in the case of every matter which you dislike we have
a right to change it.

> أُوصِيكُمْ عياد اللهِ بَتَقْوَى اللهِ، فَإنَّهـ \[ا\] خَيْرُ مَا تَوَاصَى الْعِبَادُ بِهِ، وَخَيْرُ
> عَوَاقِبِ الاْمُورِ عِنْدَ اللهِ، وَقَدْ فُتِحَ بَابُ الْحَرْبِ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَ أَهْلِ الْقِبْلَةِ، وَلاَ
> يَحْمِلُ هذَا الْعَلَمَ إِلاَّ أَهْلُ الْبَصَرِ والصَّبْرِ وَالْعِلْمِ بِمَوَاضِعِ الْحَقِّ، فَامْضُوا لِمَا
> تُؤْمَرُونَ بِهِ، وَقِفُوا عِنْدَ مَا تُنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ، وَلاَ تَعْجَلُوا فِي أَمْر حَتَّى تَتَبَيَّنُوا، فَإِنَّ
> لَنَا مَعَ كُلِّ أَمْر تُنْكِرُونَهُ غِيَراً

## The behaviour of this world with its adherents

> هوان الدنيا

Know that this world which you have started to covet and in which you
are interested, and which sometimes enrages you and sometimes pleases
you is not your (permanent) abode, nor the place of your stay for which
you might have been created, nor one to which you have been invited.
Know that it will not last for you nor will you live along with it. If
anything out of this world deceives you (into attraction), its evils
warn you too.

You should give up (the objects of) its deceits in favour of (the
objects of) its warning and (the objects of) its attractions in favour
of (the objects of) its terrors. And while here in it, advance towards
that house to which you have been called, and turn away your hearts from
the world. None of you should cry like a maid slave over anything which
she has been deprived of. Seek the perfection of Allah\'s bounty over
you by endurance in obedience to Allah and in guarding what He has asked
you to guard, namely His Book.

> أَلاَ وَإِنَّ هذِهِ الدُّنْيَا الَّتِي أَصْبَحْتُمْ تَتَمَنَّوْنَهَا وَتَرْغَبُونَ فِيهَا، وَأَصْبَحَتْ تُغْضِبُكُمْ
> وَتُرْضِيكُمْ، لَيْسَتْ بِدَارِكُمْ، وَلاَ مَنْزِلِكُمُ الَّذِي خُلِقْتُمْ لَهُ وَلاَ الَّذِي دُعِيتُمْ إِلَيْهِ،
> أَلاَ وَإِنَّهَا لَيْسَتْ بِبَاقِيَة لَكُمْ وَلاَ تَبْقَوْنَ عَلَيْهَا، وَهِيَ وَإِنْ غَرَّتْكُمْ مِنْهَا فَقَدْ
> حَذَّرَتْكُمْ شَرَّهَا، فَدَعُوا غُرُورَهَا لِتَحْذِيرِهَا، وَأَطْمَاعَهَا لِتَخْوِيفِهَا، وَسَابِقُوا فِيهَا
> إِلَى الدَّارِ الَّتي دعِيتُمْ إِلَيْهَا، وَانْصَرِفُوا بِقُلُوبِكُمْ عَنْهَا، وَلاَ يَخِنَّنَّ أَحَدُكُمْ خَنِينَ
> الاْمَةِ عَلَى مَا زُوِىَ عَنْهُ مِنْهَا، وَاسْتَتِمُّوا نِعْمَةَ اللهِ عَلَيْكُمْ بِالصَّبْرِ عَلَى طَاعَةِ
> اللهِ وَالْـمُحَافَظَةِ عَلَى مَا اسْتَحْفَظَكُمْ مِنْ كِتَابِهِ.

Know that the loss of anything of this world will not harm you, if you
have guarded the principles of your religion. Know also that after the
loss of your religion nothing of this world for which you have cared
will benefit you. May Allah carry our hearts and your hearts towards the
right and may He grant us and you endurance.

> أَلاَ وَإِنَّهُ لاَ يَضُرُّكُمْ تَضْيِيعُ شَيْء مِنْ دُنْيَاكُمْ بَعْدَ حِفْظِكُمْ قَائِمَةَ دِينِكُمْ، أَلاَ وَإِنَّهُ
> لاَ يَنْفَعُكُمْ بَعْدَ تَضْيِيعِ دِينِكُمْ شَيْءٌ حَافَظْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَمْرِ دُنْيَاكُمْ، أَخَذَ اللهُ
> بِقُلُوبِنَا وَقُلُوبِكُمْ إِلَى الْحَقِّ، وَأَلْهَمَنَا وَإِيَّاكُمُ الصَّبْرَ!

## Alternative Sources for Sermon 173

\(1\) Al-Harrani, *Tuhaf,* 130;

\(2\) Abu Ja'far al-\'Iskafi, *Naqd al-'Uthmaniyyah,* see Ibn Abi
al-Hadid, II, 171-173.

-  When the people
    collected in the Saqifah of Banu Sa\`idah in connection with the
    election, even those who were not present there were made to follow
    the decision taken there, and the principle was adopted that those
    present at the election had no right to reconsider the matter or to
    break the allegiance and those not present could do nothing but
    acquiesce in the agreed decision. But when the people of Medina
    swore allegiance at the hands of Amir al-mu\'minin, the Governor of
    Syria (Mu\`awiyah) refused to follow suit on the ground that since
    he was not present on the occasion he was not bound to abide by it,
    whereupon Amir al-mu\'minin gave a reply in this sermon on the basis
    of these accepted and agreed principles and conditions which had
    been established among these people and had become incontrovertible
    namely that: \"When the people of Medina and the ansar and the
    muhajirun have sworn allegiance on my hand, Mu\`awiyah had no right
    to keep aloof from it on the ground that he was not present on the
    occasions nor were Talhah and az-Zubayr entitled to break the pledge
    after swearing allegiance.\"\
    On this occasion, Amir al-mu\'minin did not argue on the strength of
    any saying of the Prophet which would serve as his final say about
    the caliphate, because the grounds for refusal in his case was in
    respect of the modus operandi of the principle of election.
    Therefore, in keeping with the requirements of the situation a reply
    based on the agreed principles of the adversary could alone quieten
    him. Even if he had argued on the strength of the Prophet\'s command
    it would have been subjected to various interpretations and the
    matter would have been prolonged instead of being settled. Again
    Amir al-mu\'minin had seen that soon after the death of the Prophet
    all his sayings and commands had been set aside. Therefore, how
    after the lapse of a long time, could one be expected to accept it
    when habit had been established to follow one\'s free will against
    the Prophet\'s sayings.]
