*About the greatness and the attributes of Allah*

*and the qualities of the Imams*

> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام)

> في صفات الله جل جلاله، وصفات أئمة الدين

Praise be to Allah who is proof of His existence through His creation,
of His being eternal through the newness of His creation, and through
their mutual similarities of the fact that nothing is similar to Him.
Senses cannot touch Him and curtains cannot veil Him, because of the
difference between the Maker and the made, the Limiter and the limited
and the Sustainer and the sustained.

> الْحَمْدُ للهِ الدَّالِّ عَلَى وُجُودِهِ بِخَلْقِهِ، وَبِمُحْدَثِ خَلْقِهِ عَلَى أَزَلِيَّته، وَبِاشْتِبَاهِهِمْ
> عَلَى أَنْ لاَ شَبَهَ لَهُ. لاَ تَسْتَلِمُهُ الْمَشَاعِرُ، وَلاَ تَحْجُبُهُ السَّوَاتِرُ، لاِفْتِرَاِق الصَّانِعِ
> وَالْمَصْنُوعِ، وَالْحَادِّ وَالْـمَحْدُودِ، وَالرَّبِّ وَالْمَرْبُوبِ.

He is One but not by the first in counting, is Creator but not through
activity or labour, is Hearer but not by means of any physical organ, is
Looker but not by a stretching of eyelids, is Witness but not by
nearness, is Distinct but not by measurement of distance, is Manifest
but not by seeing and is Hidden but not by subtlety (of body). He is
Distinct from things because He overpowers them and exercises might over
them, while things are distinct from Him because of their subjugation to
Him and their turning towards Him.

> الاْحَدُ لاَ بِتَأْوِيلِ عَدَد، وَالْخَالِقُ لاَ بِمَعْنَى حَرَكَة وَنَصَب، وَالسَّمِيعُ لاَ بِأَدَاة،
> وَالْبَصِيرُ لاَ بِتَفْرِيقِ آلَة، وَالشَّاهِدُ لاَبِمُمَاسَّه، وَالْبَائِنُ لاَبِتَرَاخِي مَسَافَة،
> وَالظّاهِرُ لاَبِرُؤيَة، وَالْبَاطِنُ لاَ بِلَطَافَة. بَانَ مِنَ الاْشْيَاءِ بَالْقَهْرِ لَهَا، وَالْقُدْرَةِ
> عَلَيْهَا، وَبَانَتِ الاْشْيَاءُ مِنْهُ بَالْخُضُوعِ لَهُ، وَالرُّجُوعِ إِلَيْهِ.

He who describes Him limits Him. He who limits Him numbers Him. He who
numbers Him rejects His eternity. He who said \"how\" sought a
description for Him. He who said \"where\" bounded him. He is the Knower
even though there be nothing to be known. He is the Sustainer even
though there be nothing to be sustained. He is the Powerful even though
there be nothing to be overpowered.

> مَنْ وَصَفَهُ فَقَدْ حَدَّهُ، وَمَنْ حَدَّهُ فَقَدْ عَدَّهُ، وَمَنْ عَدَّهُ فَقَدْ أَبْطَلَ أَزَلَهُ، وَمَنْ قَالَ: كَيْفَ،
> فَقَدِ اسْتَوْصَفَهُ، وَمَنْ قَالَ: أَيْنَ، فَقَدْ حَيَّزَهُ. عَالِمٌ إِذْ لاَ مَعْلُومٌ، وَرَبٌّ إِذْ لاَ
> مَرْبُوبٌ، وَقَادِرٌ إِذْ لاَ مَقْدُورٌ.

## A part of the same sermon about the Divine leaders (Imams)

> منها: في أئمّة الدين

The riser has risen, the sparkler has sparkled, the appearer has
appeared and the curved has been straightened. Allah has replaced one
people with another and one day with another. We awaited these changes
as the famine-stricken await the rain. Certainly the Imams are the
vicegerents of Allah over His creatures and they make the creatures know
Allah. No one will enter Paradise except he who knows them and knows
Him, and no one will enter Hell except he who denies them and denies
Him.

> فَقَدْ طَلَعَ طَالِعٌ، وَلَمَعَ لاَ مِعٌ، وَلاَحَ لاَئِحٌ، وَاعْتَدَلَ مَائِلٌ، وَاسْتَبْدَلَ اللهُ بِقَوْم
> قَوْماً، وَبِيَوم يَوْماً، وَانْتَظَرْنَا الْغِيَرَ انْتِظَارَ الْـمُجْدِبِ الْمَطَرَ. وَإِنَّمَا الاَئِمَّةُ
> قُوَّامُ اللهِ عَلَى خَلْقِهِ، وَعُرَفَاؤُهُ عَلَى عِبَادِهِ، لاَ يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ إِلاَّ مَنْ عَرَفَهُمْ
> وَعَرَفُوهُ، وَلاَ يَدْخُلُ النَّارَ إِلاَّ منْ أَنْكَرَهُمْ وَأَنْكَرُوهُ.

Allah the Glorified, has distinguished you with Islam and has chosen you
for it. This is because it is the name of safety and the collection of
honour. Allah the Glorified, chose its way and disclosed its pleas
through open knowledge and secret maxims. Its (Qur\'an) wonders are not
exhausted and its delicacies do not end. It contains blossoming bounties
and lamps of darkness. (The doors of) virtues cannot be opened save with
its keys, nor can gloom be dispelled save with its lamps. Allah has
protected its inaccessible points (from enemies) and allowed grazing (to
its followers) in its pastures. It contains cover (from the ailment of
misguidance) for the seeker of cure and full support for the seeker of
support.

> إِنَّ اللهَ خَصَّكُمْ بَالاْسْلاَمِ، وَاسْتَخْلَصَكُمْ لَهُ، وَذلِكَ لاِنَّهُ اسْمُ سَلاَمَة، وَجِمَاعُ كَرَامَة،
> اصْطَفَى اللهُ تَعَالَى مَنْهَجَهُ، وَبَيَّنَ حُجَجَهُ، مِنْ ظَاهِرِ عِلْم، وَبَاطِنِ حِكَم، لاَ تَفْنَى
> غَرَائِبُهُ، وَلاَ تَنْقَضِي عَجَائِبُهُ، فِيهِ مَرَابِيعُ النِّعَمِ، وَمَصَابِيحُ الظُّلَمِ، لاَ تُفْتَحُ
> الْخَيْرَاتُ إِلاَّ بِمَفَاتِحِهِ، وَلاَ تُكْشَفُ الظُّلُمَاتُ إِلاَّ بِمَصَابِحِهِ، قَدْ أَحْمَى حِمَاهُ، وَأَرْعَى
> مَرْعَاهُ، فِيهِ شِفَاءُ الْمُسْتَشْفِي، وَكِفَايَةُ الْمُكْتَفِي.

\(2\) al-\'Amidi, *Ghurar,* 232, 235.

-  The first part of
    this sermon consists of important issues concerning the science of
    knowledge about Allah, wherein Amir al-mu\'minin has thrown light on
    the matter that Allah is from ever and His attributes are the same
    as He Himself. When we cast a glance at creation, we see that for
    every movement there is a mover, from which every man of ordinary
    wisdom is compelled to conclude that no effect can appear without a
    cause, so much so, that even an infant a few days old, when his body
    is touched, feels in the depth of his consciousness that someone has
    touched him. He indicates it by opening his eyes or turning and
    looking. How then can the creation of the world and the system of
    all creation be arranged without a Creator or Organiser?\
    Once it is necessary to believe in a Creator, then He should exist
    by Himself, because everything which has a beginning must have a
    centre of existence from which it should terminate. If that too
    needed a creator, there would be the question of whether this
    creator is also the creation of some other creator or exists by
    itself. Thus unless a Self-created Creator is believed in, who
    should be the cause of all causes, the mind will remain groping in
    the unending labyrinth of cause and effect, and never attain the
    idea of the last extremity of the series of creation. It would fall
    into the fallacy of circular arguing and would not reach any end.\
    If the creator were taken to have created himself, then there would
    be (one of the two positions, namely) either he should be
    non-existent or existent. If he were not existent, then it would not
    be possible for something non-existent to create any existent being.
    If he were existent before creating himself, there would be no sense
    in coming into being again. Therefore it is necessary to believe
    that the Creator should be a Being not dependent on any other
    creator for His own existence, and everything else should be
    dependent on Him. This dependence of the entire creation is a proof
    that the existence of the Source of all creation is from ever and
    eternal. And since all beings other than He are subject to change,
    are dependent on position and place and are similar to one another
    in qualities and properties, and since similarity leads to plurality
    whereas unity has no like save itself, therefore nothing can be like
    Him.\
    Even things called one cannot be reckoned after His Unity because He
    is One and Singular in every respect. He is free and pure from all
    those attributes which are found in body or matter because He is
    neither body, nor colour, nor shape, nor does He lie in any
    direction, nor is He bounded within some place or locality.
    Therefore, man cannot see or understand Him through his senses or
    feelings, because senses can know only those things which accord
    with the limitations of time, place and matter. To believe that He
    can be seen is to believe that He has body, but since He is not a
    body, and He does not exist through a body, and He does not lie in
    any direction or place, there is no question of His being seen. But
    His being unseen is not like that of subtle material bodies, due to
    whose delicacy the eye pierces through them and eyes remain unable
    to see them; as for example the wind in the vast firmament. But He
    is unseen by His very existence. Nevertheless, nothing is unseen for
    Him. He sees as well as hears, but is not dependent on instruments
    of seeing or hearing, because if He were in need of organs of the
    body for hearing and seeing He would be in need of external things
    for His perfection and would not be a perfect Being, whereas He
    should be perfect in all respects and no attribute of perfection
    should be apart from His Self.\
    To believe in attributes separately from His Self would mean that
    there would be a self and a few attributes and the compound of the
    self and the attributes would be Allah. But a thing which is
    compounded is dependent on its parts and these parts must exist
    before their composition into the whole. When the parts exist from
    before, how can the whole be from ever and eternal because its
    existence is later than that of its parts. But Allah had the
    attributes of knowledge, power and sustaining even when nothing was
    existent, because none of His attributes were created in Him from
    outside, but His attributes are His Self and His Self is His
    attributes. Consequently, His knowledge does not depend on the
    object of knowledge existing first and then His knowledge, because
    His Self is prior to things coming into existence. Nor is it
    necessary for His power that there should first exist the object to
    be over-powered and then alone He would be called Powerful, because
    Powerful is that who has power equally for doing or abandoning and
    as such the existence of the object to be over-powered is not
    necessary.\
    Similarly Sustainer means master. Just as He is the Master of the
    non-existent after its coming into existence, in the same way He has
    power to bring it into existence from non-existence, namely if He so
    wills He may bestow existence upon it.]
