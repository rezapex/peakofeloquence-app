*In this sermon Amir al-mu\'minin has related his own condition after
the Prophet\'s migration till his meeting with him.*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> اقتصّ فيه ذكر ما كان منه بعد هجرة النبي(صلى الله عليه وآله) ثم لحاقه به

I began following the path adopted by the Prophet and treading on the
lines of his remembrance till I reached al-'Arj.

> فَجَعَلْتُ أَتْبَعُ مَأْخَذَ رَسُولِ الله (صلى الله عليه وآله) فَأَطَأُ ذِكْرَهُ، حَتَّى انْتَهَيْتُ
> إِلَى الْعَرَجِ.

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi** says: Amir al-mu\'minin\'s words *\"faata\'u
dhikrahu\"* constitute the highest forms of brevity and eloquence. He
means to say that he was being given news about the Prophet from the
commencement of his setting out till he reached this place, and he has
expressed this sense in this wonderful expression.

> قال السيد الشريف رضي الله عته في حديث طويل: فقوله (عليه السلام): «فَأطَأُ
> ذِكْرَهُ»، من الكلام الذي رُمِيَ به إلى غايتي والفصاحة والايجاز، وأراد أني
> كنتُ أُعْطي خبره(عليه السلام) من بدء خروجي إلى أن انتهيتُ إلى هذا الموضع،
> وكنّى عن ذلك بهذه الكناية العجيبة.

\(1\) Ibn al-\'Athir, *al-Nihayah,* V, *(w.t.\'a).*

-  Since the
    commencement of prophethood, the Prophet remained in Mecca for
    thirteen years. For him, this period was of the severest oppression
    and destitution. The unbelievers of the Quraysh had closed all the
    doors of livelihood upon him, and had left no deficiency in
    inflicting hardships upon him, so much so that in order to take his
    life they began contriving how to do away with him. Forty of their
    nobles assembled in the hall of audience (Dar an-Nadwah) for
    consultation, and decided that one individual should be picked out
    from every tribe and they should jointly attack him. In this way,
    Banu Hashim would not dare to face all the tribes, and the matter
    would quieten down on the payment of blood price. To give a
    practical shape to this scheme, these people sat in ambush near the
    house of the Prophet on the night of the first of Rabi\` al-awwal,
    so that when the prophet slept in his bed he would be attacked. On
    this side the preparation for killing him was complete, and on the
    other side Allah informed him of all the intrigues of the Quraysh
    unbelievers and commanded him to make \`Ali (p.b.u.h.) sleep on his
    bed and himself to emigrate to Medina. The Prophet sent for \`Ali
    (p.b.u.h.) and disclosing to him his plan, said: \"Ali, you lie on
    my bed.\" Amir al-mu\'minin enquired: \"O\' Messenger of Allah, will
    your life be saved by my sleeping here?\" The Prophet said: \"Yes.\"
    Hearing this Amir al-mu\'minin performed a prostration in
    thanks-giving and, exposing himself fully to the danger, lay on the
    Prophet\'s bed while the Prophet left from the rear door. The
    Quraysh unbelievers were peeping and getting ready for the attack
    but Abu Lahab said: \"It is not proper to attack in the night
    because there are women and children also in the house. When morning
    dawns you attack him, but keep watch during night that he should not
    move anywhere.\" Consequently, they kept their eyes on the bed
    throughout the night and soon, on the appearance of the dawn,
    proceeded forward stealthily. Hearing the sound of their footsteps,
    Amir al-mu\'minin removed the covering from his face and stood up.
    The Quraysh gazed at him with stretched eyes as to whether it was an
    illusion or fact. After making sure that it was \`Ali they enquired,
    \"Where is Muhammad?\" and \`Ali replied, \"Did you entrust him to
    me, that now you are asking me?\" They had no reply to this. Men ran
    to chase him but found footprints only up to the cave of Thawr.
    Beyond that there were neither footprints nor any sign of hiding in
    the cave. They came back bewildered while the Prophet after staying
    in the cave for three days left for Medina. Amir al-mu\'minin passed
    these three days in Mecca, returned to the people their properties
    lying in trust with the Prophet and set off towards Medina to join
    the Prophet. Upto al-\`Arj which is a place between Mecca and
    Medina, he kept getting news about the Prophet and he continued his
    anxious march in his search till he met the Prophet at Quba on the
    twelfth of Rabi\` al-awwal, and entered Medina with him. (at-Tabari,
