*Regarding the incitement of Satan: alluding to a particular group of
people (about Talhah and az-Zubayr)*

> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام)

> يريد الشيطان أويكني به عن قوم

Beware! Satan has collected his group and assembled his horse-men and
foot-soldiers. Surely, with me is my sagacity. I have neither deceived
myself nor ever been deceived. By Allah I shall fill to the brim for
them a cistern from which I alone would draw water. They can neither
turn away from it nor return to it.

> أَلاَ وإنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ قَدْ جَمَعَ حِزْبَهُ وَاسْتَجْلَبَ خَيْلَهُ وَرَجِلَهُ، وإِنَّ مَعِي لَبَصِيرَتي. مَا
> لَبَّسْتُ عَلَى نَفْسِي، وَلاَ لُبِّسَ عَلَيَّ. وَايْمُ اللهِ لاَفْرِطَنَّ لَهُمْ حَوْضاً أَنَا مَاتِحُهُ !لاَ
> يَصْدِرُونَ عَنْهُ، وَلاَ يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ.

Sermon:134 below.

- When Talhah and
    az-Zubayr broke away by violating the Oath of allegiance and set for
    Basrah in the company of \`A\'ishah, Amir al-mu\'minin spoke in
    these words which are part of the long speech.\
    Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid has written that in this sermon Satan denotes the
    real Satan as well as Mu\`awiyah because Mu\`awiyah was secretly
    conspiring with Talhah and az-Zubayr and instigating them to fight
    against Amir al-mu\'minin but the reference to the real Satan is
    more appropriate, obvious and in accord with the situation and
    circumstances.]
