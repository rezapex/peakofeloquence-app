*Arabia before proclamation of Prophethood*

> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام)

> وفيها يصف العرب قبل البعثة ثم يصف حاله قبل البيعة له

> \]العرب قبل البعثه\[

Verily, Allah sent Muhammad (S) as a warner (against vice) for all the
worlds and a trustee of His revelation, while you people of Arabia were
following the worst religion and you resided among rough stones and
venomous serpents. You drank dirty water and ate filthy food. You shed
blood of each other and cared not for relationship. Idols are fixed
among you and sins are clinging to you.

> انَّ اللهَ سُبحانَه بَعَثَ مُحَمَّداً نَذِيراً لِلْعَالَمِينَ، وَأَمِيناً عَلَى التَّنْزِيلِ، وَأَنْتُمْ
> مَعْشَرَ العَرَبِ عَلَى شَرِّ دِينٍ، وَفِي شَرِّ دَارٍ، مُنِيخُونَ بَيْنَ حِجارَةٍ خُشْنٍ وَحَيَّاتٍ صُمٍّ
> تشْرَبُونَ الكَدِرَ، وَتَأْكُلُونَ الجَشِبَ وَتَسْفِكُونَ دِمَاءَكُمْ، وَتَقْطَعُونَ أَرْحَامَكُمْ، الاْصْنَامُ
> فِيكُمْ مَنْصُوبَةٌ، وَالاْثَامُ بِكُمْ مَعْصُوبَةٌ

## Part of the same sermon in describing his condition before allegiance was paid to him (after the death of the Holy Prophet)

I looked and found that there is no supporter for me except family, so I
refrained from thrusting them unto death. I kept my eyes closed despite
motes in them. I drank despite choking of throat. I exercised patience
despite trouble in breathing and despite having to take sour colocynth
as food.

> منها:

> فَنَظَرْتُ فَإِذَا لَيْسَ لِي مُعِينٌ إِلاَّ أَهْلُ بَيْتِي، فَضَنِنْتُ بِهمْ عَنِ المَوْتِ، وَأَغْضَيْتُ عَلَى
> القَذَى، وَشَرِبْتُ عَلَى الشَّجَا وَصَبَرْتُ عَلَى أَخْذِ الكَظَمِ، وَعَلىْ أَمَرَّ مِنْ طَعْمِ العَلْقَمِ.

## Part of the same sermon on the settlement between Mu'awiyah and 'Amr ibn al-'As

He did not swear allegiance till he got him to agree that he would pay
him its price. The hand of this purchaser (of allegiance) may not be
successful and the contract of the seller may face disgrace. Now you
should take up arms for war and arrange equipment for it. Its flames
have grown high and its brightness has increased. Clothe yourself with
patience for it is the best to
victory.

> ومنها:

> وَلَمْ يُبَايعْ حَتَّى شَرَطَ أَنْ يُؤْتِيَهِ عَلَى البَيْعَةِ ثَمَناً، فَلاَ ظَفِرَتْ يَدُ المبايِعِ، وخَزِيَتْ
> أَمَانَةُ المُبْتَاعِ فَخُذُوا لِلْحَرْبِ أُهْبَتَهَا وَأعِدُّوا لَهَا عُدَّتَهَا، فَقَدْ شَبَّ لَظَاهَا وَعَلاَ
> سَنَاهَا وَاسْتَشْعِرُوا الصَّبْرَ فَإِنَّهُ أحْزَمُ لِلنَّصْرِ.

-  Amir al-mu\'minin
    had delivered a sermon before setting off for Nahrawan. These are
    three parts from it. In the first part he has described the
    condition of Arabia before Proclamation (of Prophethood); in the
    second he has referred to circumstances which forced him to keep
    quiet and in the third he has described the conversation and
    settlement between Mu\`awiyah and \`Amr ibn al-\`As. The position of
    this mutual settlement was that when Amir al-mu\'minin sent Jarir
    ibn \`Abdillah al-Bajali to Mu\`awiyah to secure his allegiance he
    detained Jarir under the excuse of giving a reply, and in the
    meantime he began exploring how far the people of Syria would
    support him. When he succeeded in making them his supporters by
    rousing them to avenge \`Uthman\'s blood he consulted his brother
    \`Utbah ibn Abi Sufyan. He suggested, \"If in this matter \`Amr ibn
    al-\`As was associated he would solve most of the difficulties
    through his sagacity, but he would not be easily prepared to
    stabilise your authority unless he got the price he desired for it.
    If you are ready for this he would prove the best counsellor and
    helper.\" Mu\`awiyah liked this suggestion, sent for \`Amr ibn
    al-\`As and discussed with him, and eventually it was settled that
    he would avenge \`Uthman\'s blood by holding Amir al-mu\'minin
    liable for it in exchange for the governorship of Egypt, and by
    whatever means possible would not let Mu\`awiyah\'s authority in
    Syria suffer. Consequently, both of them fulfilled the agreement and
    kept their words fully.]
