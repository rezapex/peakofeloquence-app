If one wish is fulfilled the desire for fulfilment of\nanother wish crops up. This world is like the reflection. If you run\nafter it then it will itself run forward but if you leave it and run\naway from it then it follows you. In the same way, if a person does\nnot run after the world, the world runs after him. The implication\nis that if a person breaks the clutches of greed and avarice and\nkeeps aloof from undesirable hankering after the world, he too gets\n(pleasures of) the world and he does not remain deprived of it.\nTherefore, he who surveys this world from above its surface and\ntakes lesson from its chances and happenings, and through its\nvariation, and alterations gains knowledge about Allah's Might,\nWisdom and Sagacity, Mercy, Clemency and Sustaining power, his eyes\nwill gain real brightness and sight. On the other hand the person\nwho is lost only in the colourfulness of the world and its\ndecorations, he loses himself in the darkness of the world that is\nwhy Allah has forbidden to view the world thus: And strain not thine\neyes unto that which We have provided (different) parties of them,\n(of) the splendour of the life of this world, so that We may try\nthem in it; for the provision of thy Lord is better and more\nabiding.
