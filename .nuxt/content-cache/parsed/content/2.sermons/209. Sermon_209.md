title: Sermon 209
description:

Amir al-mu\'minin went to enquire about the health of his companion
al-'Ala\' ibn Ziyad al-Harithi and when he noticed the vastness of his
house he said:

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> بالبصرة، وقد دخل على العلاء بن زياد الحارثي ـ وهو من أصحابه ـ يعوده،
> فلما رأى سعة داره قال:

What will you do with this vast house in this world, although you need
this house more in the next world. If you want to take it to the next
world you could entertain in it guests and be regardful of kinship and
discharge all (your) obligations according to their accrual. In this way
you will be able to take it to the next world.

> مَا كُنْتَ تَصْنَعُ بِسِعَةِ هذِهِ الدارِ فِي الدُّنْيَا، أَنْتَ إِلَيْهَا فِي الاْخِرَةِ كُنْتَ أَحْوَجَ؟
> وَبَلَى إِنْ شِئْتَ بَلَغْتَ بِهَا الاْخِرَةَ، تَقْرِي فِيهَا الضَّيْفَ، وَتَصِلُ فِيهَا الرَّحِمَ، وَتُطْلِعُ
> مِنْهَا الْحُقُوقَ مَطَالِعَهَا، فَإذَا أَنْتَ قَدْ بَلَغْتَ بِهَا الاْخِرَةَ.

**Then al-'Ala\' said to him:** O\' Amir al-mu\'minin, I want to
complain to you about my brother 'Asim ibn Ziyad.

**Amir al-mu\'minin enquired:** What is the matter with him?

**al-'Ala\' said:** He has put on a woollen coat and cut himself away
from the world.

Amir al-mu\'minin said: Present him to me.

> فقال له العلاء: يا أميرالمؤمنين، أشكو إليك أخي عاصم بن زياد. قال: وما
> له؟ قال: لبس العباءة وتخلّى من الدنيا. قال: عليَّ به.

**When he came Amir al-mu\'minin said:** O enemy of yourself. Certainly,
the evil (Satan) has misguided you. Do you feel no pity for your wife
and your children? Do you believe that if you use those things which
Allah has made lawful for you, He will dislike you? You are too
unimportant for Allah to do so.

**He said:** O Amir al-mu\'minin, you also put on coarse dress and eat
rough food.

**Then he replied:** Woe be to you, I am not like you. Certainly, Allah,
the Sublime, has made it obligatory on true leaders that they should
maintain themselves at the level of low people so that the poor do not
cry over their poverty.

> فلمّا جاء قال: يَا عُدَىَّ نَفْسِهِ! لَقَدِ اسْتَهَامَ بِكَ الْخَبِيثُ! أَمَا رَحِمْتَ أَهْلَكَ وَوَلَدَكَ!
> أَتَرَى اللهَ أَحَلَّ لَكَ الطَّيِّبَاتِ، وَهُوَ يَكْرَهُ أَنْ تَأْخُذَهَا! أَنْتَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَى اللهِ مِنْ
> ذلِكَ! قال: يا أميرالمؤمنين، هذا أنت في خشونة ملبسك وجُشوبة مأكلك! قال:
> وَيْحَكَ، إِنِّي لَسْتُ كَأَنْتَ، إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى فَرَضَ عَلى أَئِمَّةِ الْعَدْلِ أَنْ يُقَدِّرُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ
> بِضَعَفَةِ النَّاسِ، كَيْلاَ يَتَبَيَّغَ بِالْفَقِيرِ فَقْرُهُ!

-  From ancient days
    asceticism and the abandonment of worldly attachments has been
    regarded as a means of purification of the spirit and important for
    the character. Consequently, those who wished to lead a life of
    abstemiousness and meditation used to go out of the cities and towns
    to stay in forests and caves in the mountains and stay there
    concentrating on Allah according to their own conception. They would
    eat only if a casual traveller or the inhabitant of nearby dwellings
    gave them anything to eat, otherwise they remained contented with
    the fruits of wild trees and the water of the streams, and thus they
    passed their life. This way of worship commenced in a way that was
    forced by the oppression and hardships of rulers. Certain people
    left their houses and, in order to avoid their grip, hid themselves
    in some wilderness or cave in a mountain, engaging themselves in
    worship of and devotion to Allah. Later on, this forced asceticism
    acquired a voluntary form and people began to retire to caves and
    hollows of their own volition. Thus it became an accepted way that
    whoever aimed at spiritual development retired to some corner after
    severing himself from all worldly ties. This method remained in
    vogue for centuries and even now some traces of this way of worship
    are found among the Buddhists and the Christians.\
    The moderate views of Islam do not, however, accord with the
    monastic life, because for attaining spiritual development it does
    not advocate the abandonment of worldly enjoyments and successes,
    nor does it view with approbation that a Muslim should leave his
    house and fellow men and busy himself in formal worship, hiding in
    some corner. The conception of worship in Islam is not confined to a
    few particular rites, but it regards the earning of one\'s
    livelihood through lawful means, mutual sympathy and good behaviour,
    and co-operation and assistance also to be important constituents of
    worship. If an individual ignores worldly rights and obligations and
    does not fulfil his responsibility towards his wife and children,
    nor occupies himself in efforts to earn a livelihood, but all the
    time stays in meditation, he ruins his life and does not fulfil the
    purpose of living. If this were Allah\'s aim, what would have the
    need for creating and populating the world when there was already a
    category of creatures who were all the time engaged in worshipping
    and adoration.\
    Nature has made man to stand on the cross-roads at which the midway
    is the centre of guidance. If he deviates from this point of
    moderateness even a bit, this way or that way, there is shear
    misguidance for him. That midway is that he should neither bend
    towards this world to such an extent as to ignore the next life,
    devoting himself entirely to this one, nor should he abstain from
    this world so as not to have any connection with anything of it,
    confining himself to some corner leaving everything else. Since
    Allah has created man in this world he should follow the code of
    life for living in this world, and should partake of the comforts
    and pleasures bestowed by Allah within moderate limits. The eating
    and using of things made lawful by Allah is not against Allah\'s
    worship, but rather Allah has created these things for the very
    purpose that they should be taken advantage of. That is why those
    who were the chosen of Allah lived in this world with others and ate
    and drank like others. They did not feel the need to turn their
    faces away from the people of the world, and to adopt the wilderness
    or the caves of mountains as their abodes, or to live in distant
    spots. On the other hand they remembered Allah, remained
    disentangled from worldly affairs, and did not forget death despite
    the pleasures and comforts of life.\
    The life of asceticism sometimes produces such evils as ruin the
    next life also as well as this one, and such an individual proves to
    be the true picture of \"the looser in this life as well as the
    next.\" When natural impulses are not satisfied in the lawful and
    legal way the mind turns into a centre of evil-ideas and becomes
    incapable of performing worship with peace and concentration; and
    sometimes passions so overcome the ascetic that breaking all moral
    fetters, he devotes himself completely to their satisfaction and
    consequently falls in an abyss of ruin for which it is impossible to
    extract himself. That is why religious law accords a greater
    position to the worship performed by a family man than that by a
    non-family man, because the former can exercise mental peace and
    concentration in the worship and rituals.\
    Individuals who put on the cloak of Sufism and make a loud show of
    their spiritual greatness are cut off from the path of Islam and are
    ignorant of its wide teachings. They have been misled by Satan and,
    relying on their self-formed conceptions, tread wrongful paths.
    Eventually their misguidance becomes so serious that they begin to
    regard their leaders as having attained such a level that their word
    is as the word of Allah and their act is as the act of Allah.
    Sometimes they regard themselves beyond all the bounds and
    limitations of religious law and consider every evil act to be
    lawful for them. This deviation from faith and irreligiousness is
    named Sufism (complete devotion to Allah). Its unlawful principles
    are called \"at-tariqah\" (ways of achieving communion with Allah)
    and the followers of this cult are known as Sufis. First of all Abu
    Hashim al-Kufi and Shami adopted this nickname. He was of Umayyad
    descent and a fatalist (believing that man is bound to act as
    pre-ordained by Allah). The reason for giving him this name was
    that, in order to make a show of his asceticism and fear for Allah,
    he put on a woollen cloak. Later on this nickname became common and
    various grounds were put forth as the basis of this name. For
    example, one ground is that \'Sufi\' has three letters, \"sad\",
    \"waw\" and \"fa\'\". \"sad\" stands for \"sabr\" (endurance),
    \"sidq\" (truthfulness) and \"safa\" (purity of heart); \"waw\"
    stands for \"wudd\" (love), \"wird\" (repeating Allah\'s name) and
    \"wafa\'\" (faithfulness to Allah), and \"fa\'\" stands for \"fard\"
    (unity), \"faqr\" (destitution) and \"fana\'\" (death or absorption
    in Allah\'s Self). The second view is that it has been derived from
    \"as-Suffah\", which was a platform near the Prophet\'s mosque which
    had a covering of date-palm leaves. Those who stayed there were
    called Ashabu\'Suffah (people of the platform). The third view is
    that the name of the progenitor of an Arab tribe was Sufah, and this
    tribe performed the duties of serving the pilgrims and the Ka\`bah,
    and it is with reference to their connection with this tribe that
    these people were called Sufis. This group is divided among various
    sects but the basic sects are seven only.\
    1) al-Wahdatiyyah (unitarian):\
    This sect believes in the oneness of all existence. Its belief is
    that everything of this world is Allah, so much so that they assign
    to even polluted things the same godly position. They liken Allah
    with the river and the waves rising in it, and argue that the waves
    which sometimes rise and sometimes fall have no separate existence
    other than the river, but their existence is exactly the existence
    of the river. Therefore, nothing can be separated from its own
    existence.\
    2) al-Ittihadiyyah (the unitists):\
    They believe that they have united with Allah and Allah has united
    with them. They liken Allah with fire and themselves with iron that
    lies in the fire and acquires its form and property.\
    3) al-Hululiyyah (the formists):\
    Their belief is that Allah takes the form of those who claim to know
    Him and the perfect ones, and their bodies are places of His stay.
    In this way, they are seemingly men but really Allah.\
    4) al-Wasiliyyah (the combiners):\
    This sect considers itself to have combined with Allah. Their belief
    is that the laws of the shari\`ah are a means of development of
    human personality and character, and that when the human self
    combines with Allah it no more needs perfection or development.
    Consequently, for the \"wasilin\", worship and ritual become
    useless, because they hold that when truth and reality is achieved
    shari\`ah remains of no avail. Therefore, they can do anything and
    they cannot be questioned.\
    5) az-Zarraqiyyah (the revellers):\
    This sect regards vocal and instrumental music as worship, and earns
    the pleasures of this world through a show of asceticism and begging
    from door to door. They are ever engaged in relating concocted
    stories of miraculous performances of their leaders to over-awe the
    common people.\
    6) al-\`Ushshaqiyyah (the lovers):\
    The theory of this sect is that apparency is the means to reality,
    meaning that carnal love is the means to achieve love of Allah. That
    is, in order to reach the stage of Allah\'s love it is necessary to
    have love with some human beauty. But the love which they regard as
    love for Allah is just the product of mental disorder through which
    the lover inclines to one individual with all his attention and his
    final aim is to have access to the beloved. This love can lead to
    the way of evil and vice, but it has no connection with the love of
    Allah.\
    A Persian couplet says: The truth of the fact is that carnal love is
    like a jinn and a jinn cannot give you guidance.\
    7) at-Talqiniyyah (the encounterers):\
    According to this sect, the reading of religious sciences and books
    of scholarship is thoroughly unlawful. Rather, the position that is
    achieved by an hour of spiritual effort of the Sufis cannot be
    achieved by seventy years of reading books.\
    According to Shi\`ah \`Ulama\' all these sects are on the wrong path
    and out of the fold of Islam. In this connection, numerous sayings
    of the Imams are related. In this sermon also Amir al-mu\'minin has
    regarded the severance of \`Asim ibn Ziyad from this world as the
    mischief of Satan, and he forcefully dissuaded him from adopting
    that course. (For further study, see Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, al-Hajj
