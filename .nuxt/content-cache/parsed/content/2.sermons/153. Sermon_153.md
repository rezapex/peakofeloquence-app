*About negligent persons and the characteristics of beasts, carnivores
and women*

> ومن خطبه له (عليه السلام)

> صفة الضال

He has been allowed time by Allah. He is falling into error along with
negligent persons and goes early in the morning with sinners, without
any road to lead or any Imam to guide.

> وَهُوَ فِي مُهْلَة مِنَ اللهِ يَهْوِي مَعَ الْغَافِلِينَ، وَيَغْدُومَعَ الْمُذْنِبِينَ، بلاَ سَبِيل قَاصِد،
> وَلاَ إِمَام قَائِد.

## A part of the same sermon (qualities of the heedless)

> منها: في صفات الغافلين

At last when Allah will make clear to them the reward for their sins,
and take them out from the veils of their neglectfulness they will
proceed to what they were running away from, and run away from what they
were proceeding to. They will not benefit from the wants they will
satisfy or the desires they would fulfil.

> حَتَّى إِذَا كَشَفَ لَهُمْ عَنْ جَزَاءِ مَعْصِيَتِهِمْ، وَاسْتَخْرَجَهُمْ مِنْ جَلاَبِيبِ غَفْلَتِهِمُ، استَقْبَلُوا
> مُدْبِراً، وَاسْتَدْبَرُوا مُقْبِلاً، فَلَمْ يَنْتَفِعُوا بَمَا أَدْرَكُوا منْ طَلِبَتِهِمْ، وَلاَ بِمَا قَضَوْا
> مِنْ وَطَرِهِمْ.

I warn you and myself from this position. A man should derive benefit
from his own self. Certainly, prudent is he who hears and ponders over
it, who sees and observes and who benefits from instructive material and
then treads on clear paths wherein he avoids falling into hollows and
straying into pitfalls, and does not assist those who misguide him by
turning away from truthfulness, changing his words, or fearing truth.

> إِنِّي أُحَذِّرُكُمْ، وَنَفْسِي، هذِهِ الْمَنْزِلَةَ، فَلْيَنْتَفِعِ امْرُؤٌ بِنَفْسِهِ، فَإِنَّمَا الْبَصِيرُ مَنْ
> سَمِعَ فَتَفَكَّرَ، وَنَظَرَ فَأَبْصَرَ، وَانْتَفَعَ بِالْعِبَرِ، ثُمَّ سَلَكَ جَدَداً وَاضِحاً يَتَجَنَّبُ فِيهِ
> الصَّرْعَةَ فِي الْمَهَاوِي، وَالضَّلاَلَ في الْمَغَاوِي، وَلاَ يُعِينُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ الْغُوَاةَ بِتَعَسُّف
> فِي حَقٍّ، أَوْ تَحَرِيف في نُطْق، أَوْ تَخَوُّف مِنْ صِدْق.

## Exhorting the people

> عظة الناس

O my listener! Be cured from your intoxication, wake up from your
slumber, decrease your hasty activity and ponder over what has come to
you through the Holy Prophet, the *Ummi*

which is inevitable and inescapable. You should turn away from him who
opposes him and leave him and leave whatever he has adopted for himself.
Put off your vanity, drop your haughtiness and recall your grave because
your way passes over it. You will be dealt with as you deal with others,
you will reap what you sow, and what you send today will meet you
tomorrow. So provide for your future and send (some good acts) for your
day (of reckoning). Fear, fear, O listener! Act, act, O careless one!
***"None can inform you like the One who is aware"*** **(35:14).**

> فَأَفِقْ أَيُّهَا السَّامِعُ مِنْ سَكْرَتِكَ، وَاسْتَيْقِظْ مَنْ غَفْلَتِكَ، وَاخْتَصِرْ مِنْ عَجَلَتِكَ، وَأَنْعِمِ
> الْفِكْرَ فِيَما جَاءَكَ عَلَى لِسَانِ النَّبِيِّ الاْمِّيِّ (صلى الله عليه وآله) مِمَّا لاَ بُدَّ
> مِنْهُ وَلاَ مَحِيصَ عَنْهُ، وَخَالِفْ مَنْ خَالَفَ ذلِكَ إِلَى غَيْرِهِ، وَدَعْهُ وَمَا رَضِيَ لِنَفْسِهِ، وَضَعْ
> فَخْرَكَ، وَاحْطُطْ كِبْرَكَ، وَاذكُرْ قَبْرَكَ، فَإِنَّ عَلَيْهِ مَمَرَّكَ، وَكَمَا تَدِينُ تُدَانُ، وَكَمَا تَزْرَعُ
> تَحْصُدُ، وَمَا قَدَّمْتَ الْيَوْمَ تَقْدَمُ عَلَيْهِ غَداً، فَامْهَد لِقَدَمِكَ، وَقَدِّمْ لِيَوْمِكَ. فَالْحَذَرَ
> الْحَذَرَ أَيُّهَا الْمُسْتَمِعُ! وَالْجِدَّ الْجِدَّ أَيُّهَا الْغَافِلُ! (وَلاَ يُنَبِّئُكَ مِثْلُ خَبِير).

One of the firm decisions of Allah in the Wise Reminder (Qur\'an) upon
which He bestows reward or gives punishment, and through which He likes
or dislikes is that it will not benefit a man, even though he exerts
himself and acts sincerely if he leaves this world to meet Allah with
one of these acts without repenting, namely that he believed in a
partner with Allah during his obligatory worship, or appeased his own
anger by killing an individual, or spoke about acts committed by others,
or sought fulfilment of his needs from people by introducing an
innovation in his religion, or met people with a double face, or moved
among them with a double tongue. Understand this because an illustration
is a guide for its like.

> إِنَّ مِنْ عَزَائِمِ اللهِ فِي الذِّكْرِ الْحَكِيمِ، الَّتِي عَلَيْهَا يُثِيبُ وَيُعَاقِبُ، وَلَهَا يَرْضَى
> وَيَسْخَطُ، أَنَّهُ لاَ يَنْفَعُ عَبْداً ـ وَإِنْ أَجْهَدَ نَفْسَهُ، وَأَخْلَصَ فِعْلَهُ ـ أَنْ يَخْرُجَ مِنَ
> الدُّنْيَا، لاَقِياً رَبَّهُ بِخَصْلَة مِنْ هذِهِ الْخِصَال لَمْ يَتُبْ مِنْهَا: أَنْ يُشْرِكَ بِالله فِيَما
> افْتَرَضَ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ عِبَادَتِهِ، أَوْ يَشْفِيَ غَيْظَهُ بِهَلاَكِ نَفْسِهِ، أَوْ يُقِرَّ بِأَمْر فَعَلَهُ غَيْرُهُ،
> أَوْ يَسْتَنْجِحَ حَاجَةً إِلَى النَّاسِ بِإِظْهَارِ بِدْعَة فِي دِينِهِ، أَوْ يَلْقَى النَّاسَ بِوَجْهَيْنِ، أَوْ
> يَمْشِيَ فِيهِمْ بِلِسَانَيْنِ. اعْقِلْ ذلِكَ فَإِنَّ الْمِثْلَ دَلِيلٌ عَلَى شِبْهِهِ.

Beasts are concerned with their bellies. Carnivores are concerned with
assaulting others. Women are concerned with the adornments of this
ignoble life and the creation of mischief herein

(On the other hand) believers are humble, believers are admonishers and
believers are afraid (of Allah).

> إِنَّ الْبَهَائِمَ هَمُّهَا بُطُونُهَا، وَإِنَّ السِّبَاعَ هَمُّهَا الْعُدْوَانُ عَلَى غَيْرِهَا، وَإِنَّ النِّسَاءَ
> هَمُّهُنَّ زِينَةُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَالْفَسَادُ فِيهَا; إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ مُسْتَكِينُونَ، إِنَّ
> الْمُؤْمِنينَ مُشْفِقُونَ، إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنينَ خَائِفُونَ.

-  The word \"ummi\"
    has been used in the Holy Qur\'an with reference to the Holy Prophet
    in chapter 7:157-158. For better understanding of the word refer to
    the books of commentary on the Holy
    Qur\'an.]
-  The intention is
    to say that the cause of all mischief and evil is the passion to
    satisfy bodily needs and the passion to subdue. If a human being is
    subjugated by the passion to satisfy bodily needs and considers
    filling the stomach as his aim there will be no difference between
    him and a beast, because a beast too has no aim except to fill its
    belly. But if he is over-powered by the passion to subdue others and
    takes to killing and devastation there will be no difference between
    him and a carnivorous beast, because the latter\'s aim is also
    tearing and devouring. If both the passions are at work in him then
    he is like a woman, because in a woman both these passions act side
    by side and because of this she is extremely eager of adornment and
    is active in fanning mischief and disturbance. However, a true
    believer will never agree to adopt these habits as his mode of
    behaviour, rather he keeps his passions suppressed so that he
    neither allows pride and vanity to approach near him nor does he fan
    mischief or disturbance for fear of Allah.\
    Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid has written that Amir al-mu\'minin delivered this
    sermon at the time of marching towards Basrah, and since the trouble
    of Basrah was the result of a woman\'s instigation, Amir
    al-mu\'minin has, after mentioning beasts and carnivore, held a
    woman also to possess such qualities. Thus the battle of Basrah was
    the result of these qualities, whereby thousands of persons were
    involved in death and destruction.]
