*Amir al-mu\'minin said to his companions about Mu'awiyah*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام) لاصحابه

> في صفة رجل مذموم، ثم في فضله هو عليه السلام

Soon after me, there would be put on you a man with a broad mouth and a
big belly. He would swallow whatever he gets and would crave for what he
does not get. You should kill him but (I know) you would not kill him.
He would command you to abuse me and to renounce me. As for abusing, you
do abuse me because that would mean purification for me and salvation
for you. As regards renunciation, you should not renounce me because I
have been born on the natural religion (Islam) and was foremost in
accepting it as well as in Hijrah ( migrating from Mecca to
Medina).

> أما إنِّهُ سِيَظْهَرُ عَلَيْكُمْ بَعْدِي رَجُلٌ رَحْبُ الْبُلْعُومِ، مُنْدَحِقُ الْبَطْنِ، يَأْكُلُ مَا يَجِدُ،
> وَيَطْلُبُ مَا لاَ يَجِدُ، فَاقْتُلُوهُ، وَلَنْ تَقْتُلُوهُ! أَلاَ وَإِنَّهُ سَيَأْمُرُكُمْ بِسَبِّي وَالْبَرَاءَةِ
> مِنِّي; فَأَمَّا السَّبُّ فَسُبُّونِي، فَإِنَّهُ لي زَكَاةٌ،وَلَكُمْ نَجَاةٌ; وَأَمَّا الْبَرَاءَةُ فَلاَ
> تَتَبَرَّأُوا مِنِّي، فَإِنِّي وَلِدْتُ عَلَى الْفِطْرَةِ، وَسَبَقْتُ إِلَى الاْيمَانِ وَالْهِجْرَةِ.

-  About the person
    to whom Amir al-mu\'minin has alluded in this sermon some people
    hold that he is Ziyad ibn Abih; some hold that he is al-Hajjaj ibn
    Yusuf ath-Thaqafi and some hold that he is Mughirah ibn Shu\`bah.
    But most of the commentators have held him to be Mu\`awiyah and this
    is correct because the qualities that Amir al-mu\'minin has
    described prove true fully on him alone .Thus Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid has
    written about the gluttonous quality of Mu\`awiyah that once the
    prophet sent for him and he was informed that Mu\`awiyah was busy
    eating. Then a second and third time a man was sent to call him but
    he brought the same news. Thereupon the Prophet said , \"May Allah
    never satisfy his belly.\" The effect of this curse was that when he
    felt tired of eating he would say , \"Take away, for, by Allah I am
    not satiated but I am tired and disgusted.\" Similarly, his abusing
    Amir al-mu\'minin and ordering his officers for it are such accepted
    facts of history about which there is no scope of denying. In this
    connection such words were used on the pulpit that even Allah and
    the Prophet were hit by them. Thus, Umm al-mu\'minin Umm Salamah
    wrote to Mu\`awiyah, \"Certainly you people abuse Allah and the
    Prophet, and this is like this that you hurl abuses on \`Ali and
    those who love him, while I do stand witness that Allah and the
    Prophet did love him.\" (al-\`Iqd al-Farid, Vol. 3, p. 131)\
    Thanks to \`Umar ibn \`Abdil-\`Aziz who put a stop to it, and
    introduced the following verse in place of abuse in the sermons:
    Verily Allah enjoineth justice and benevolence (to others) and
    giving unto the kindred, and forbidden lewdness, and evil, and
    rebellion; He exhorteth you that ye may take heed (Qur\'an 16:90)\
    In this sermon Amir al-mu\'minin has ordered his killing on the
    basis of the Prophet\'s order that \"When you (O\' Muslims) see
    Mu\`awiyah on my pulpit, kill him.\" (Kitab Siffin, pp. 243, 248;
