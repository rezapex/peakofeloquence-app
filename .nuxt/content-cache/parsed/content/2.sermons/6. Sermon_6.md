*Delivered on being advised not to chase Talhah ibn 'Ubaydillah and
az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwam for fighting.*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> لمّا أشير عليه بألاّ يتبع طلحةَ والزبيرَ ولا يُرصدَ لهما القتال

> \[وفيه يبين عن صفته بأنه (عليه السلام) لا يخدع\]

By Allah, I shall not be like the badger, that feigns sleep on
continuous (sound of) stone-throwing till he who is in search of it
finds it or he who is on the look out for it overpowers it. Rather, I
shall ever strike the deviators from truth with the help of those who
advance towards it, and the sinners and doubters with the help of those
who listen to me and obey, till my day (of death) comes. By Allah I have
been continually deprived of my right, with others being given
preference to me, from the day the Prophet died till today.

> وَاللهِ لاَ أَكُونُ كالضَّبُعِ: تَنَامُ عَلى طُولِ اللَّدْمِ، حَتَّى يَصِلَ إِلَيْهَا طَالِبُهَا،وَيَخْتِلَهَا
> رَاصِدُها، وَلكِنِّي أَضْرِبُ بِالمُقْبِلِ إِلَى الحَقِّ المُدْبِرَ عَنْهُ، وَبِالسَّامِعِ المُطِيعِ العَاصِيَ
> المُريبَ أَبَداً، حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ عَلَيَّ يَوْمِي. فَوَاللهِ مَا زِلتُ مَدْفُوعاً عَنْ حَقِّي، مُسْتَأْثَراً
> عَلَيَّ، مُنْذُ قَبَضَ اللهُ تعالى نَبِيَّهُ (صلى الله عليه وآله) حَتَّى يَوْمِ النَّاسِ هذَا.

-  When Amir
    al-mu\'minin showed intention to chase Talhah and az-Zubayr, he was
    advised to leave them on their own lest he received some harm from
    them. Amir al-mu\'minin uttered these words in reply, the sum total
    whereof is: \"How long can I be a mere spectator to my right being
    snatched and keep quiet. Now, so long as I have breath of life I
    shall fight them and make them suffer the consequences of their
    conduct. They should not think that I can be easily over-powered
    like the badger.\"]

    Dabu\` means badger. Its nickname is Umm \`Amir and Umm Turrayq. It
    is also called \"the glutton\", because it swallows everything and
    eats up whatever it gets as if several bellies were contained in
    one, and they do not have their fill. It is also called Na\`thal. It
    is a very simple and silly animal. Its slyness is apparent from the
    way it is easily caught. It is said that the hunter surrounds its
    den and strikes it with his foot or a stick, and calls out softly,
    \"Bow you head Umm Turrayq, conceal yourself Umm \`Amir.\"

    On repeating this sentence and patting the ground, it conceals
    itself in a corner of the den. Then the hunter says, \"Umm \`Amir is
    not in its den, it is sleeping.\" On hearing this it stretches its
    limbs and feigns sleep. The hunter then puts the knot in its feet
    and drags it out, and if falls like a coward into his hand without
    resistance.
