Thus, Ibn Maytham\nal-Bahrani writes (in Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 4, pp. 200-201):"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIt is related from al-`Allamah al-Wabari, that he said that Amir\nal-mu'minin's intention is to say that the scope of his religious\nknowledge is larger than his knowledge about matters of the world."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nBut taking the context into account, this explanation cannot be held\nto be correct because this sentence (which is the subject of\nexplanation) has been used as the cause of the sentence \"Ask me\nbefore you miss me\", and after it, is the prophesy about revolt. In\nbetween these two the occurrence of the sentence that \"I know\nreligious matters more than worldly matters\", makes the whole\nutterance quite uncounted, because Amir al-mu'minin's challenge to\nask whatever one likes is not confined to matters of religious law\nonly so this sentence could be held as its cause. Then, after that,\nthe prophesy of the rising up of the revolt has nothing to do with\nmatters of religious law, so that it could be put forth as a proof\nof more knowledge of religious matters. To ignore the clear import\nof the words and to interpret them in a way which does not suit the\noccasion, does not exhibit a correct spirit, when from the context\nalso the same meaning accrues which the words openly convey. Thus,\nit is to give a warning about the Umayyad's mischief that Amir\nal-mu'minin uttered the words: \"'Ask me whatever you like';\nbecause I know the paths and courses of divine destiny more than the\npassages of the earth. So, even if you ask me about matters which\nare recorded in the 'preserved tablet' and concern divine destiny\nI can tell you, and a serious mischief is to rise against me in\nthose matters in which you should have doubt, because my eyes are\nmore acquainted with those ethereal lines which concern the\noccurrence of events and mischiefs than, with what I know about live\nappearing on the earth. The occurrence of this mischief is as\ncertain as an object seen with eyes. You should therefore ask me its\ndetails and the way to keep safe from it, so that you may be able to\nmanage your defence when the times comes.\" This meaning is\nsupported by the successive sayings of Amir al-mu'minin which he\nuttered in connection with the unknown, and to which the future\ntestified. Thus, Ibn Abi'l Hadid comments on this claim of Amir\nal-mu'minin as follows:"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nAmir al-mu'minin's claim is also supported by his sayings about\nfuture events which he uttered not once or a hundred times but\ncontinuously and successively, from which there remains no doubt\nthat whatever he spoke was on the basis of knowledge and certainly\nand not in the way of chance.
