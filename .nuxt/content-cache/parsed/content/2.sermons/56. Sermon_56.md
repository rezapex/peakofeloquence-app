*About steadiness in the battlefield*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> يصف أصحاب رسول الله

> وذلك يوم صفين حين أمر الناس بالصلح

In the company of the Prophet of Allah (S) we used to fight our parents,
sons, brothers and uncles, and this continued us in our faith, in
submission, in our following the right path, in endurance over the pangs
of pain and in our fight against the enemy.

A man from our side and one from the enemy would pounce upon each other
like energetic men contesting as to who would kill the other; sometime
our man got over his adversary and some-time the enemy\'s man got over
ours.

> وَلَقَدْ كُنَّا مَعَ رَسُولِ اللهِ(صلى الله عليه وآله)، نَقْتُلُ آبَاءَنا وَأَبْنَاءَنَا
> وَإخْوَانَنا وَأَعْمَامَنَا، مَا يَزِيدُنَا ذلِكَ إلاَّ إِيمَاناً وَتَسْلِيماً، وَمُضِيّاً عَلَى اللَّقَمِ،
> وَصَبْراً عَلى مَضَضِ الاْلَمِ، وَجِدّاً عَلى جِهَادِ الْعَدُوِّ، وَلَقَدْ كَانَ الرَّجُلُ مِنَّا وَالاْخَرُ مِنْ
> عَدُوِّنا يَتَصَاوَلاَنِ تَصَاوُلَ الْفَحْلَيْنِ، يَتَخَالَسَانِ أَنْفُسَهُمَا، أيُّهُمَا يَسْقِي صَاحِبَهُ كَأْسَ
> المَنُونِ، فَمَرَّةً لَنَا مِنْ عَدُوِّنَا، ومَرَّةً لِعَدُوِّنا مِنَّا،

When Allah had observed our truth, He sent ignominy to our foe and sent
His succour to us till Islam got established (like the camel) with neck
on the ground and resting in its place. By my life, if we had also
behaved like you, no pillar of (our) religion could have been raised,
nor could the tree of faith have borne leaves. By Allah, certainly you
will now milk our blood (instead of milk) and eventually you will face
shame.

> فَلَمَّا رَأَى اللهُ صِدْقَنَا أَنْزَلَ بِعَدُوِّنَا الْكَبْتَ، وَأَنْزَلَ عَلَيْنَا النَّصرَ، حَتَّى اسْتَقَرَّ
> الاْسْلاَمُ مُلْقِياً جِرَانَهُ وَمُتَبَوِّئاً أَوْطَانَهُ، وَلَعَمْرِي لَوْ كُنَّا نَأْتِي مَا أَتَيْتُمْ، مَا
> قَامَ لِلدِّينِ عَمُودٌ، وَلاَ اخْضَرَّ لِلاِيمَانِ عُودٌ، وَأَيْمُ اللهِ لَتَحْتَلِبُنَّهَا دَماً،
> وَلَتُتْبِعُنَّهَا نَدَماً!

-  When Muhammad ibn
    Abi Bakr had been killed Mu\`awiyah sent \`Abdullah ibn \`Amir
    al-Hadrami to Basrah to exhort the people of Basrah for avenging
    \`Uthman\'s blood because the natural inclination of most of the
    inhabitants of Basrah and particularly of Banu Tamim was towards
    \`Uthman. Consequently, he stayed with Banu Tamim. This was the time
    when \`Abdullah ibn \`Abbas, the governor of Basrah had gone to
    Kufah for condolence about Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, leaving Ziyad ibn
    \`Ubayd (Abih) as his substitute. When the atmosphere in Basrah
    began to deteriorate Ziyad informed Amir al-mu\'minin of all the
    facts. Amir al-mu\'minin tried to get Banu Tamim of Kufah ready but
    they kept complete silence and gave no reply. When Amir al-mu\'minin
    saw this weakness and shamelessness on their part he gave this
    speech namely that \"During the days of the Prophet (S) we did not
    see whether those killed at our hands were our kith and kin, but
    whoever collided with Right, we were prepared to collide with him.
    If we too had acted carelessly or been guilty of inaction like you
    then neither religion could have taken root nor could Islam prosper.
    \"The result of this shaking was that A\`yan ibn Dabi\`ah
    al-Mujashi\`i prepared himself but on reaching Basrah he was killed
    by the swords of the enemy. Thereafter, Amir al-mu\'minin sent off
    Jariyah ibn Qudamah as-Sa\`di with fifty men of Bani Tamim. First he
    tried his best to canvass his own tribe but instead of following the
    right path they stooped down to abusing and fighting. Then Jariyah
    called Ziyad and the tribe of Azd for his help. Soon on their
    arrival (\`Abdullah) Ibn al-Hadrami also came out with his men.
    Swords were used from both sides for some time but eventually Ibn
    al-Hadrami fled away with seventy persons and took refuge in the
    house of Sabil as-Sa\`di. When Jariyah saw no other way he got this
    house set on fire. When fire rose into flames they came out in
    search of safety but could not succeed in running away. Some of them
    were crushed to death under the wall while others were
    killed.]
