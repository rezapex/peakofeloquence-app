Consequently, he stayed with Banu Tamim. This was the time\nwhen `Abdullah ibn `Abbas, the governor of Basrah had gone to\nKufah for condolence about Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, leaving Ziyad ibn\n`Ubayd (Abih) as his substitute. When the atmosphere in Basrah\nbegan to deteriorate Ziyad informed Amir al-mu'minin of all the\nfacts. Amir al-mu'minin tried to get Banu Tamim of Kufah ready but\nthey kept complete silence and gave no reply. When Amir al-mu'minin\nsaw this weakness and shamelessness on their part he gave this\nspeech namely that \"During the days of the Prophet (S) we did not\nsee whether those killed at our hands were our kith and kin, but\nwhoever collided with Right, we were prepared to collide with him.\nIf we too had acted carelessly or been guilty of inaction like you\nthen neither religion could have taken root nor could Islam prosper.\n\"The result of this shaking was that A`yan ibn Dabi`ah\nal-Mujashi`i prepared himself but on reaching Basrah he was killed\nby the swords of the enemy. Thereafter, Amir al-mu'minin sent off\nJariyah ibn Qudamah as-Sa`di with fifty men of Bani Tamim. First he\ntried his best to canvass his own tribe but instead of following the\nright path they stooped down to abusing and fighting. Then Jariyah\ncalled Ziyad and the tribe of Azd for his help. Soon on their\narrival (`Abdullah) Ibn al-Hadrami also came out with his men.\nSwords were used from both sides for some time but eventually Ibn\nal-Hadrami fled away with seventy persons and took refuge in the\nhouse of Sabil as-Sa`di. When Jariyah saw no other way he got this\nhouse set on fire. When fire rose into flames they came out in\nsearch of safety but could not succeed in running away. Some of them\nwere crushed to death under the wall while others were\nkilled.]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-56","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 56"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2.sermons:56.
