The\nvery purpose of our fighting has been that they should follow the\nQur'an and act on its injunctions. For Allah's sake do not fall in\ntheir deceitful device. Go ahead with determination and courage and\nstop only after vanquishing the dying foe.\" Nevertheless, the\ndeceitful instrument of wrong had worked. The people took to\ndisobedience and rebellion. Mis`ar ibn Fadaki at-Tamimi and Zayd\nibn Husayn at-Ta'i each with twenty thousand men came forward and\nsaid to Amir al-mu'minin, 'O' `Ali, if you do not respond to the\ncall of the Qur'an we will deal with you in the same manner as we\ndid with `Uthman. You end the battle at once and bow before the\nverdict of the Qur'an. Amir al-mu'minin tried his best to make\nthem understand but Satan was standing before them in the garb of\nthe Qur'an. He did not allow them to do so, and they compelled Amir\nal-mu'minin that he should send someone to call Malik ibn al-Harith\nal-Ashtar from the battlefield. Being obliged, Amir al-mu'minin\nsent Yazid ibn Hani to call Malik back. When Malik heard this order\nhe was bewildered and said, \"Please tell him this is not the\noccasion to leave the position. He may wait a bit then I will come\nto his audience with the tidings of victory.\" Hani conveyed this\nmessage on return but people shouted that Amir al-mu'minin must\nhave sent word to him secretly to continue. Amir al-mu'minin said\nhe never got any occasion to send any secret message to him.\nWhatever he said was said before them. People said he should be sent\nagain and that if Malik delayed his return Amir al-mu'minin should\nforsake his life. Amir al-mu'minin again sent Yazid ibn Hani and\nsent word that rebellion had occurred, he should return in whatever\ncondition he was. So Hani went and told Malik \"You hold victory\ndear or the life of Amir al-mu'minin. If his life is dear you\nshould raise hands off the battle and go to him.\" Leaving the\nchances of victory Malik stood up and came to the audience of Amir\nal-mu'minin with grief and disappointment.

Seeing this wrong selection Amir al-mu'minin\nsaid, \"Since you have not accepted my order about arbitration at\nleast now agree that do not make Abu Musa the arbitrator. He is not\na man of trust. Here is `Abdullah ibn `Abbas and here is Malik\nal-Ashtar. Select one of them.\" But they did not at all listen to\nhim and stuck to his name.

If we regarded him Amir al-mu'minin why\nshould this battle have been fought?\" At first Amir al-mu'minin\nrefused to rub it off but when they did not in any way agree, he\nrubbed it off and said, \"This incident is just similar to the one\nat al-Hudaybiyah when the unbelievers stuck on the point that the\nwords 'Prophet of Allah' with the name of the Prophet should be\nremoved and the Prophet did remove it.\" On this `Amr ibn al-`As\ngot angry and said, \"Do you treat us as unbelievers?\" Amir\nal-mu'minin said, \"On what day have you had anything to do with\nbelievers and when have you been their supporters?\" However, after\nthis settlement, the people dispersed, and after mutual consultation\nthese two arbitrators decided that by removing both `Ali and\nMu`awiyah from the Caliphate the people should be accorded the\npower to choose whomever they desired. When time came to its\nannouncement there was a meeting at Dumatu'l-Jandal, a place\nbetween Iraq and Syria, and then two arbitrators also reached there\nto announce the judgement on the fate of the Muslims. Acting\ncunningly `Amr ibn al-`As said to Abu Musa, \"I regard it ill\nmanner to precede you. You are older in years and age so first you\nmake the announcement.\" Abu Musa succumbed to his flattery and came\nout proudly and stood before the gathering. Addressing them he said,\n\"O' Muslims we have jointly settled that `Ali ibn Abi Talib and\nMu`awiyah should be removed and the right to choose a Caliph be\naccorded to the Muslims. They should choose whomever they like.\"\nSaying this he sat down. Now the turn was for `Amr ibn al-`As and\nhe said, \"O' Muslims you have heard that Abu Musa removed `Ali\nibn Abi Talib. I also agree with it. As for Mu`awiyah, there is no\nquestion of removing him. Therefore I place him in his position.\"\nNo sooner that he said this there were cries all round. Abu Musa\ncried hoarse that it was a trick, a deceit and told `Amr ibn\nal-`As that, \"You have played a trick, and your example is that of\na dog on which if you load something he would gasp, or leave him he\nwould gasp.\" `Amr ibn al-`As said, \"Your example is like the ass\non whom books are loaded.\" However `Amr ibn al-`As's trick was\neffective and Mu`awiyah's shaking feet were again stabilised. This\nwas the short sketch of the Arbitration whose basis was laid in the\nQur'an and sunnah. But was it a verdict of the Qur'an or the\nresult of those deceitful contrivances which people of this world\nemploy to retain their authority?
