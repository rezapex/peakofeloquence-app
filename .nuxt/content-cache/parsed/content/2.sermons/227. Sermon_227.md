(According to at-Tabari) al-Mughirah related that \"When\n`Umar was buried I came to `Ali and I wanted to hear something\nfrom him about `Umar. So, on my arrival Amir al-mu'minin came out\nin this state that was wrapped in one cloth after bathing and was\njerking the hair of his head and beard and he had no doubt that the\nCaliphate would come to him.

On\nthis ground what weight his statements can carry is quite clear.\nFrom the factual point of view also, this story cannot be accepted.\nAl-Mughirah's statement that Amir al-mu'minin had no doubt about\nhis Caliphate is against the facts. What were the factors from which\nhe made this guess when the actual facts were to the contrary. If\nthe caliphate was certain for any one, it was `Uthman. Thus, at the\nConsultative Committee `Abd ar-Rahman ibn `Awf said to Amir\nal-mu'minin: \"O' `Ali! do not create a situation against\nyourself for I have observed and consulted the people and they all\nwant `Uthman.\" (at-Tabari, vol. 1, p. 2786; Ibn al-Athir, vol.\n3, p. 71; Abu'l-Fida', vol. 1, p. 166)"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nConsequently, Amir al-mu'minin was sure not to get the caliphate as\nhas already been stated on the authority of at-Tabari's History,\nunder the sermon of the Camel's Foam (ash-Shiqshiqiyyah), namely\nthat on seeing the names of the members of the Consultative\nCommittee, Amir al-mu'minin had said to al-`Abbas ibn `Abd\nal-Muttalib that the caliphate could not be given to anyone except\n`Uthman since all the powers had been given to `Abd ar-Rahman ibn\n`Awf and he was `Uthman's brother-in-law (sister's husband) and\nSa`d ibn Abi Waqqas was a relative and tribesman of `Abd\nar-Rahman.

If he knew that Amir al-mu'minin had good ideas about\n`Umar, he should have also known his impression; but if he thought\nthat Amir al-mu'minin did not entertain good ideas about him then\nthe purpose of his asking Amir al-mu'minin would be none other than\nthat whatever he may say he would, by exposing it, create an\natmosphere against him and make the members of the Consultative\nCommittee suspicious of him. The views of the members of the\nConsultative Committee are well understood from the very fact that\nby putting the condition of following the conduct of the first two\nCaliphs in electing the caliph they had shown their adherence to\nthem. In these circumstances when al-Mughirah tried to play this\ntrick Amir al-mu'minin said just by way of relating a fact that\n`Umar achieved the good (of this world) and remained safe from its\nevil. This sentence has no connection with praise or eulogy. `Umar\ndid in his days enjoy all kinds of advantages while his period was\nfree from the mischiefs that cropped up later. After recording this\nstatement Ibn Abi'l-Hadid writes:"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nFrom this event the belief gains strength that in this utterance the\nallusion is towards `Umar."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIf the utterance means the word uttered by Ibnah Abi Hathmah about\nwhich Amir al-mu'minin has said that they are not her own heart's\nvoice but she was made to utter them, then doubtlessly the reference\nis to `Umar, but the view that these words were uttered by Amir\nal-mu'minin in praise of `Umar is not at all established. Rather,\nfrom this tradition it is evidently shown that these words were\nuttered by Ibnah Abi Hathmah. Allah alone knows on what ground the\nwords of Ibnah Abi Hathmah are quoted and then it is daringly argued\nthat these words were uttered by Amir al-mu'minin about `Umar. It\nseems Amir al-mu'minin had uttered these words about someone on\nsome occasion, then Ibnah Abi Hathmah used similar words on\n`Umar's death and then even Amir al-mu'minin's words were taken\nto be in praise of `Umar. Otherwise, no mind except a mad one can\nargue that the words uttered by Ibnah Abi Hathmah should be deemed a\nground to hold that Amir al-mu'minin said these words in praise of\n`Umar. Can it be expected, after (a glance at) the sermon of the\nCamel's Foam, that Amir al-mu'minin might have uttered these\nwords. Again, it is worth consideration that if these words had been\nuttered by Amir al-mu'minin on `Umar's death, then at the\nConsultative Committee when he refused to follow the conduct of the\n(first) two Caliphs it should have been said to him that only the\nother day he has said that `Umar had established the sunnah and\nbanished innovations, so that when his conduct was in accord with\nthe sunnah what was the sense in accepting the sunnah but refusing\nto follow his conduct.]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-227","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 227"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2.sermons:227.
