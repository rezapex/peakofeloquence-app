*When Masqalah*  *ibn Hubayrah ash-Shaybani fled to Mu'awiyah because he
had purchased some prisoners of Banu Najiyah from an executive of Amir
al-mu'minin, but when he demanded the price the latter avoided and ran
to Syria, Amir al-mu'minin said:*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> لمّا هرب مَصْقَلة بنُ هُبيرة الشيباني إلى معاوية، وكان قد ابتاع سَبْيَ بني
> ناجية من عامل أميرالمؤمنين (عليه السلام) وأعتقهم، فلمّا طالبه(عليه
> السلام) بالمال خاس به وهرب إلى الشام،

Allah may be bad to Masqalah. He acted like the noble but fled away like
a slave. Before his admirer could speak (about him) he silenced him and
before his eulogist could testify to his good deeds he closed his mouth.
If he had stayed behind we would have taken from him what he could
easily pay and waited for the balance till his money increased.

> قَبَّحَ اللهُ مَصْقَلَةَ! فَعَلَ فِعْلَ السَّادَةِ، وَفَرَّ فِرَارَ الْعَبِيدِ! فَمَا أَنْطَقَ مَادِحَهُ حَتَّى
> أَسْكَتَهُ، وَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَاصِفَهُ حَتَّى بَكَّتَهُ، وَلَو أَقَامَ لاَخَذْنَا مَيْسُورَهُ، وَانْتَظَرْنا بِمَالِهِ
> وُفُورَهُ.

-  When after
    Arbitration the Kharijites rose, a man of Bani Najiyah from them
    named al-Khirrit ibn Rashid an-Naji stood up for instigating people
    and set off towards al-Mada\'in with a group killing and marauding.
    Amir al-mu\'minin sent Ziyad ibn Khasafah with three hundred men to
    check him. When the two forces met at al-Mada\'in they attacked each
    other with swords. Only one encounter or so had taken place when the
    gloom of evening prevailed and the battle had to be stopped. When
    morning appeared Ziyad\'s men noticed that five dead bodies of the
    Kharijites were lying and they themselves had cleared off the
    battlefield. Seeing this Ziyad set off for Basrah along with his
    men. There he came to know that the Kharijites had gone to Ahwaz.
    Ziyad did not move onwards for paucity of force and informed Amir
    al-mu\'minin of it. Amir al-mu\'minin called back Ziyad and sent
    Ma\`qil ibn Qays ar-Riyah\'i with two thousand experienced
    combatants towards Ahwaz and wrote to the governor of Basrah
    \`Abdullah ibn \`Abbas to send two thousand swordsmen of Basrah for
    the help of Ma\`qil. Consequently, the contingent from Basrah also
    joined them at Ahwaz and after proper organisation they got ready
    for attacking the enemy. But al-Khirrit marched on along with his
    men to the hills of Ramhurmuz. These people also followed him and
    overtook him near these hills. Both arrayed their forces and started
    attacking each other. The result of this encounter was also that
    three hundred and seventy Kharijites were killed in the battlefield
    while the rest ran away. Ma\`qil informed Amir al-mu\'minin of his
    performance and of the enemy\'s running away when Amir al-mu\'minin
    directed him to chase them and so to shatter their power that they
    should not be able to raise heads again. On receipt of this order he
    moved on and overtook him on the coast of the Persian gulf where
    al-Khirrit had by persuasion secured the co-operation of the people
    and enlisting men from here and there, had collected a considerable
    force. When Ma\`qil reached there, he raised the flag of peace and
    announced that those who had collected from here and there should
    get away. They would not be molested. The effect of this
    announcement was that save for his own community all others deserted
    him. He organised those very men and commenced the battle but
    valorous combatants of Basrah and Kufah displayed such excellent use
    of swords that in a short time one hundred and seventy men of the
    insurgents were killed while an-Nu\`man ibn Suhban ar-Rasib\'i
    encountered al-Khirrit (ibn Rashid an-Naji) and eventually felled
    him and killed him. Soon upon his fall the enemy lost ground and
    they fled away from the battlefield. Thereafter Ma\`qil collected
    all the men, women and children from their camps at one place. From
    among them those who were Muslims were released after swearing of
    allegiance. Those who had turned heretics were called upon to resume
    Islam. Consequently except one old Christian all others secured
    release by accepting Islam and this old man was killed. Then he took
    with him those Christians of Bani Najiyah who had taken part in this
    revolt together with their families. When Ma\`qil reached Ardashir
    Khurrah (a city of Iran) these prisoners wailed and cried, before
    its governor Masqalah ibn Hubayrah ash-Shaybani and beseeched
    humiliatively to do something for their release. Masqalah sent word
    to Ma\`qil through Dhuhl ibn al-Harith to sell these prisoners to
    him. Ma\`qil agreed and sold those prisoners to him for five hundred
    thousand Dirhams and told him to dispatch the price immediately to
    Amir al-mu\'minin. He said that he was sending the first instalment
    at once and the remaining instalments would also be sent soon. When
    Ma\`qil met Amir al-mu\'minin he related the whole event before him.
    Amir al-mu\'minin ratified this action and waited for the price for
    some time, but Masqalah observed such deep silence as if nothing was
    due from him. At last Amir al-mu\'minin sent a messenger to him and
    sent him word to either send the price or to come himself. On Amir
    al-mu\'minin\'s order he came to Kufah and on demand of the price
    paid two hundred thousand Dirhams but to evade the balance went away
    to Mu\`awiyah\'s who made him the governor of Tabarastan. When Amir
    al-mu\'minin came to know all this he spoke these words (as in this
    sermon). Its sum total is that, \"If he had stayed we would have
    been considerate to him in demanding the price and would have waited
    for improvement of his financial condition, but he fled away like
    slaves after displaying a showy act. Talk about his high
    perseverance had just started when people began to discuss his
    baseless and lowliness.\"]
