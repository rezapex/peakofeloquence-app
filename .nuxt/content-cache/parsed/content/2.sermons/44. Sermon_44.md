When the two forces met at al-Mada'in they attacked each\nother with swords. Only one encounter or so had taken place when the\ngloom of evening prevailed and the battle had to be stopped. When\nmorning appeared Ziyad's men noticed that five dead bodies of the\nKharijites were lying and they themselves had cleared off the\nbattlefield. Seeing this Ziyad set off for Basrah along with his\nmen. There he came to know that the Kharijites had gone to Ahwaz.\nZiyad did not move onwards for paucity of force and informed Amir\nal-mu'minin of it. Amir al-mu'minin called back Ziyad and sent\nMa`qil ibn Qays ar-Riyah'i with two thousand experienced\ncombatants towards Ahwaz and wrote to the governor of Basrah\n`Abdullah ibn `Abbas to send two thousand swordsmen of Basrah for\nthe help of Ma`qil. Consequently, the contingent from Basrah also\njoined them at Ahwaz and after proper organisation they got ready\nfor attacking the enemy. But al-Khirrit marched on along with his\nmen to the hills of Ramhurmuz. These people also followed him and\novertook him near these hills. Both arrayed their forces and started\nattacking each other. The result of this encounter was also that\nthree hundred and seventy Kharijites were killed in the battlefield\nwhile the rest ran away. Ma`qil informed Amir al-mu'minin of his\nperformance and of the enemy's running away when Amir al-mu'minin\ndirected him to chase them and so to shatter their power that they\nshould not be able to raise heads again. On receipt of this order he\nmoved on and overtook him on the coast of the Persian gulf where\nal-Khirrit had by persuasion secured the co-operation of the people\nand enlisting men from here and there, had collected a considerable\nforce. When Ma`qil reached there, he raised the flag of peace and\nannounced that those who had collected from here and there should\nget away. They would not be molested. The effect of this\nannouncement was that save for his own community all others deserted\nhim. He organised those very men and commenced the battle but\nvalorous combatants of Basrah and Kufah displayed such excellent use\nof swords that in a short time one hundred and seventy men of the\ninsurgents were killed while an-Nu`man ibn Suhban ar-Rasib'i\nencountered al-Khirrit (ibn Rashid an-Naji) and eventually felled\nhim and killed him. Soon upon his fall the enemy lost ground and\nthey fled away from the battlefield. Thereafter Ma`qil collected\nall the men, women and children from their camps at one place. From\namong them those who were Muslims were released after swearing of\nallegiance. Those who had turned heretics were called upon to resume\nIslam. Consequently except one old Christian all others secured\nrelease by accepting Islam and this old man was killed. Then he took\nwith him those Christians of Bani Najiyah who had taken part in this\nrevolt together with their families. When Ma`qil reached Ardashir\nKhurrah (a city of Iran) these prisoners wailed and cried, before\nits governor Masqalah ibn Hubayrah ash-Shaybani and beseeched\nhumiliatively to do something for their release. Masqalah sent word\nto Ma`qil through Dhuhl ibn al-Harith to sell these prisoners to\nhim. Ma`qil agreed and sold those prisoners to him for five hundred\nthousand Dirhams and told him to dispatch the price immediately to\nAmir al-mu'minin. He said that he was sending the first instalment\nat once and the remaining instalments would also be sent soon. When\nMa`qil met Amir al-mu'minin he related the whole event before him.\nAmir al-mu'minin ratified this action and waited for the price for\nsome time, but Masqalah observed such deep silence as if nothing was\ndue from him. At last Amir al-mu'minin sent a messenger to him and\nsent him word to either send the price or to come himself. On Amir\nal-mu'minin's order he came to Kufah and on demand of the price\npaid two hundred thousand Dirhams but to evade the balance went away\nto Mu`awiyah's who made him the governor of Tabarastan. When Amir\nal-mu'minin came to know all this he spoke these words (as in this\nsermon). Its sum total is that, \"If he had stayed we would have\nbeen considerate to him in demanding the price and would have waited\nfor improvement of his financial condition, but he fled away like\nslaves after displaying a showy act. Talk about his high\nperseverance had just started when people began to discuss his\nbaseless and lowliness.\"]"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"alternative-sources-for-sermon-44","depth":2,"text":"Alternative Sources for Sermon 44"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:2.sermons:44.
