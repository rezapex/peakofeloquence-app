*One should not be afraid of the scarcity of those who tread on the
right path (a counsel to tread the clear path of guidance)*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> يعظ بسلوك الطريق الواضح

O people! Do not be desolate at the small number of those who follow the
right path, because people throng only round the table (of this world)
where the duration of satiety is short and its hunger is prolonged.

> أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، لاَ تَسْتَوْحِشُوا فِي طَرِيقِ الْهُدَىُ لِقِلَّةِ أَهْلِهِ، فَإِنَّ النَّاسَ قَدِ اجْتَمَعُوا
> عَلَى مَائِدَة شِبَعُهَا قَصِيرٌ، وَجُوعُهَا طَوِيلٌ.

O people, certainly, what gathers people together (in categories) is
(their) agreement (to good or bad) and (their) disagreement, for only
one individual killed the camel of Thamud

but Allah held all of them in punishment because all of them consented
to it. Thus, Allah, the Glorified. has said:

***Then they hamstrung her, and turned*** **(themselves)**
***regretful.*** **(Qur\'an, 26:157).**

Then their land declined by sinking (into the earth) as the spike of a
plough pierces unploughed weak land. O people, he who treads the clear
path (of guidance) reaches the spring of water, and whoever abandons it
strays into waterless desert.

> أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، إِنَّمَا يَجْمَعُ النَّاسَ الرِّضِى وَالسُّخْطُ، وَإِنَّمَا عَقَرَ نَاقَةَ ثَمُودَ رَجُلٌ وَاحِدٌ
> فَعَمَّهُمُ اللهُ تَعَالَى بالْعَذَابِ لَمَّا عَمُّوهُ بالرِّضَى، فَقَالَ سُبْحَانَهُ: (فَعَقَرُوهَا
> فَأَصْبَحُوا نَادِمِينَ)، فَمَا كَانَ إِلاَّ أَنْ خَارَتْ أَرْضُهُمْ بِالْخَسْفَةِ خُوَارَالسِّكَّةِ الْـمُحْمَاةِ
> فِي الاْرْضِ الْخَوَّارَةِ. أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، مَنْ سَلَكَ الطّرِيقَ الْوَاضِحَ وَرَدَ الْمَاءَ، وَمَنْ خَالَفَ
> وَقَعَ فِي التِيهِ!

-  Thamud, in
    ancient Arabia, a tribe or group of tribes, seems to have been
    prominent from about the 4th Century B.C. to the first half of the
    7th Century A.D. Their place of stay and homeland was at a place
    lying on the way between the Hijaz and Syria called the Valley of
    al-Qura and bore this name because it consisted of several
    townships. Allah deputed for their guidance and directions the
    Prophet Salih who preached to them as Allah relates in his story:\
    And unto (the people of) Thamud (We did send) their brother Salih,
    he said: \"O\' my people! Worship ye Allah (alone). Ye have no god
    other than Him; indeed came unto you a clear proof from your Lord;
    this is the She-camel of Allah (which) unto you is a sign, so leave
    it (free) to pasture in Allah\'s earth and touch her not with any
    harm, or ye shall be seized with a painful chastisement. And
    remember when He made you successors after the (people) \`Ad and
    settled you in the earth, ye build mansions on its plain and hew the
    mountains into dwellings. So remember ye the bounties of Allah, and
    see ye not evil in the earth, making mischief.\" Said the chiefs of
    those who were puffed up with pride among his people to those who
    were reckoned weak, to those who believed from among them; \"Know ye
    that Salih is sent by his Lord?\" Said they: \"Verily, in what he
    hath been sent with, we are believers.\" Said those who were puffed
    up with pride; \"Verily we, in that which ye believe are
    disbelievers.\" They hamstrung the She-camel and rebelled against
    the command of their Lord, and they said: \"O\' Salih! bring us what
    thou didst, threaten us with, if thou art of the apostles.\" Then
    seized them (unawares) the earthquake, so became they in their
    dwellings, motionless (dead). Then he turned away from them and
    said: \"O\' my people! Indeed I did deliver unto you the message of
    my Lord, and did admonish you, but ye love not the admonishers.\"
    (Qur\'an, 7:73-79).\
    (The people of) Thamud belied the warners, and said they: \"What! a
    single man, from among us! and we to follow him? Verily then we
    shall be astray and in distress. It is that (the duty of) reminding
    hath been bestowed on him (alone), of all the (people) among us?
    Nay! he is a great liar, an insolent one!\" \"Soon they shall know
    on the morrow, (as to) who is the liar, the insolent one! (O\' Our
    Apostle Salih!) verily We are going to send the She-camel as a trial
    for them; so watch them and be patient. And (thou O\' Salih!) make
    them aware (beforehand) that the water is (to be) divided between
    them; and every drinking share shall be witnessed (on it).\" But
    they called their companions, then he pursued (her) and hamstrung
    (her). How (great) was My chastisement and My warning? Verily sent
    We upon them a single (violent) blast, and they were (all) like the
    dry stubble used by a fencer in a fence. (Qur\'an,
    54:23-31).]
