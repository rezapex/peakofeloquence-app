*Spoken when 'Umar ibn al-Khattab consulted Amir al-mu\'minin about
taking part in the battle of Persia.*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> وقد استشاره عمر بن الخطاب في الشخوص لقتال الفرس بنفسه

In this matter, victory or defeat is not dependent on the smallness or
greatness of forces. It is Allah\'s religion which He has raised above
all faiths, and His army which He has mobilised and extended, till it
has reached the point where it stands now, and has arrived its present
positions. We hold a promise from Allah, and He will fulfil His promise
and support His army.

> إِنَّ هذَا الاْمْرَ لَمْ يَكُنْ نَصْرُهُ وَلاَ خِذْلاَنُهُ بِكَثْرَة وَلاَ بِقِلَّة، وَهُوَ دِينُ اللهِ الَّذِي
> أَظْهَرَهُ، وَجُنْدُهُ الَّذِي أَعَدَّهُ وَأَمَدَّهُ، حَتَّى بَلَغَ مَا بَلَغَ، وَطَلَعَ حَيْثُ طَلَعَ، وَنَحْنُ عَلَى
> مَوْعُود مِنَ اللهِ، وَاللهُ مُنْجِزٌ وَعْدَهُ، وَنَاصِرٌ جُنْدَهُ.

The position of the head of government is that of the thread for beads,
as it connects them and keeps them together. If the thread is broken,
they will disperse and be lost, and will never come together again. The
Arabs today, even though small in number are big because of Islam and
strong because of unity. You should remain like the axis for them, and
rotate the mill (of government) with (the help of) the Arabs, and be
their root. Avoid battle, because if you leave this place the Arabs will
attack you from all sides and directions till the unguarded places left
behind by you will become more important than those before you.

> وَمَكَانُ الْقَيِّمِ بِالاْمْرِ مَكَانُ النِّظَامِ مِنَ الْخَرَزِ يَجْمَعُهُ وَيَضُمُّهُ: فَإِنِ انْقَطَعَ النِّظَامُ
> تَفَرَّقَ وَذَهَبَ، ثُمَّ لَمْ يَجْتَمِعُ بِحَذَافِيرِهِ أَبَداً. وَالْعَرَبُ الْيَومَ وَإِنْ كَانُوا قَلِيلاً،
> فَهُمْ كَثِيرُونَ بَالاْسْلاَمِ، عَزِيزُونَ بَالاجْتِماعِ! فَكُنْ قُطْباً، وَاسْتَدِرِ الرَّحَا بِالْعَرَبِ،
> وَأَصْلِهِمْ دُونَكَ نَارَ الْحَرْبِ، فَإِنَّكَ إِنْ شَخَصْتَ مِنْ هذِهِ الاَرْضِ انْتَقَضَتْ عَلَيْكَ الْعَرَبُ مِنْ
> أَطْرَافِهَا وَأَقْطَارِهَا، حَتَّى يَكُونَ مَا تَدَعُ وَرَاءَكَ مِنَ الْعَوْرَاتِ أَهَمَّ إِلَيْكَ مِمَّا بَيْنَ
> يَدَيْكَ.

If the Persians see you tomorrow they will say, \"He is the root (chief)
of Arabia. If we do away with him we will be in peace.\" In this way
this will heighten their eagerness against you and their keenness to aim
at you. You say that they have set out to fight against the Muslims.
Well, Allah detests their setting out more than you do, and He is more
capable of preventing what He detests. As regards your idea about their
(large) number, in the past we did not fight on the strength of large
numbers but we fought on the basis of Allah\'s support and assistance.

> إِنَّ الاَعَاجِمَ إِنْ يَنْظُرُوا إِلَيْكَ غَداً يَقُولُوا: هذا أَصْلُ الْعَرَبِ، فَإِذَا اقْتَطَعْتُمُوهُ
> اسْتَرَحْتُمْ، فَيْكُونُ ذلِكَ أَشَدَّ لِكَلَبِهِمْ عَلَيْكَ، وَطَمَعِهِمْ فِيكَ. فَأَمَّا مَا ذَكَرْتَ مِنْ مَسِيرِ
> الْقَوْمِ إِلَى قِتَالِ المُسْلِمِينَ، فَإِنَّ اللهَ سُبْحَانَهُ هُوَ أَكْرَهُ لِمَسِيرِهِمْ مِنْكَ، وَهُوَ أَقْدَرُ
> عَلَى تَغْيِيرِ مَا يَكْرَهُ . وَأَمَّا مَا ذَكَرْتَ مِنْ عَدَدِهِمْ، فَإِنَّا لَمْ نَكُنْ نُقَاتِلُ فِيَما مَضَى
> بِالْكَثْرَةِ، وَإِنَّمَا كُنَّا نُقَاتِلُ بِالنَّصْرِ وَالْمَعُونَةِ!

-  When some people
    advised Caliph \`Umar to partake in the battle of al-Qadisiyyah or
    Nahawand, he finding it against his personal inclination, thought it
    necessary to consult Amir al-mu\'minin, so that if he advised
    against it he would plead before others that he had stayed back on
    Amir al-mu\'minin\'s advice, but also if he advised partaking in the
    battle some other excuse would be found. However, unlike others,
    Amir al-mu\'minin advised him to stay back. The other people had
    advised him to join in fighting, because the Holy Prophet did not
    send only others to fight but took part in it himself as well,
    keeping his close relations also with him. What Amir al-mu\'minin
    had in view was that \`Umar\'s presence in the battle could not be
    beneficial to Islam, but rather his staying back would save the
    Muslims from dispersion.\
    Amir al-mu\'minin\'s view that \"the position of the head of
    government is that of the axis around which the system of the
    government rotates\" is a point of principle and does not concern
    any particular personality. Whether the ruler is a Muslim or an
    unbeliever, just or despotic, virtuous or vicious, for the
    administration of the state his presence is a necessity, as Amir
    al-mu\'minin has explained elsewhere at greater length:\
    The fact is that there is no escape for men from a ruler good or
    bad. Faithful persons perform (good) acts in his rule while the
    unfaithful enjoys (worldly) benefits in it. During the rule, Allah
    will carry everything to its end. Through the ruler tax is
    collected, the enemy is fought, roads are protected and the right of
    the weak is taken from the strong till the virtuous enjoy peace and
    are allowed protection from (the oppression of) the wicked. (Sermon
    40)\
    The words which Amir al-mu\'minin uttered in his advice are not
    indicative of any quality of Caliph \`Umar except his being the
    ruler. There is no doubt that he held worldly authority,
    irrespective of the question of whether it was secured in the right
    way or wrong way. And where there is authority there is centring of
    people\'s affairs. That is why Amir al-mu\'minin said that if \`Umar
    would go out the Arabs would follow him in large numbers towards the
    battlefield, because when the ruler is on the march the people will
    not like to stay behind. The result of their going would be that
    city after city would become vacant, while the enemy will infer from
    their reaching the battlefield that the Islamic cities are lying
    vacant, and that if these people were repulsed no assistance would
    reach the Muslims from the centre. Again, if the ruler were killed
    the army would disperse automatically, because the ruler is as its
    foundation. When the foundation is shaken the walls cannot remain
    standing. The word \"aslu\'l-\`Arab\" (the root chief) of Arabia has
    not been used by Amir al-mu\'minin as his own but he has taken it
    from the Persians. Obviously in his capacity as the head of the
    State, Caliph \`Umar was, in their view, the chief of Arabia.
    Besides, the reference is to the country, not to Islam or Muslims,
    so that there is no suggestion of any importance for him from the
    Islamic point of view.\
    When Amir al-mu\'minin pointed out to Caliph \`Umar that on his
    reaching there the Persians would aim at him, and that if he fell
    into their hands they would not spare him without killing, although
    such words would have touched the brave to the quick and would have
    heightened their spirits, \`Umar liked the advice to stay back and
    thought it better to keep himself away from the flames of battle. If
    this advice had not been in accord with his personal inclination he
    would not have received it so heartily and would have tried to argue
    that the administration of the country could be maintained by
    leaving a deputy. Again when other people had already advised him to
    go out, what was the need for consulting Amir al-mu\'minin except to
    get an excuse to stay back.]
