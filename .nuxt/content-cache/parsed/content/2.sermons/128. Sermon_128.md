For some time they traded freely without fear\nbut on one occasion `Alau'd-Din accused them of spying, seized\ntheir goods and had them killed by the Chief of Atrar.

Now Chingiz Khan lost all patience and his eyes filled with\nblood. He rose with his sword in hand, and the Tartar warriors leapt\ntowards Bukhara on their speedy stallions. `Alau'd-Din came out\nwith four hundred thousand combatants to face him but could not\nresist the incessant assaults of the Tartars, and having been\nvanquished only after a few attacks ran away to Nishabur across the\nriver Jaxartes (Sihun). The Tartars smashed Bukhara and razed it to\nthe ground. They pulled down schools and mosques, burning to ashes\nthe houses and killing men and women without distinction. Next year\nthey assaulted Samarqand and devastated it completely. After the\nflight of `Alau'd-Din, his son Jalalu'd-Din Khwarazm Shah had\nassumed the reins of government The Tartars chased him also, and for\nten years he fled from one place to the other but did not fall in\ntheir hands. At last he crossed over the river out of the boundaries\nof his realm. During this time the Tartars did their utmost to ruin\npopulated lands and to annihilate humanity. No city escaped their\nruining and no populace could avoid their trampling. Wherever they\nwent they upset the kingdom, overthrew governments, and in a short\ntime established their authority over the northern portion of Asia.\nWhen Chingiz Khan died in 622 A.H. his own son Ogedei Khan succeeded\nhim. He searched out Jalalu'd-Din in 628 A.H. and killed him. After\nhim Mongka Khan, the son of the other son of Chingiz Khan, occupied\nthe throne. After Mongka Khan, Qubilai Khan succeeded to a part of\nthe country and the control of Asia fell to the share of his brother\nHulagu Khan. On the division of the whole realm among the grandsons\nof Chingiz Khan, Hulagu Khan was thinking of conquering Muslims\nareas when the Hanafite of Khurasan in enmity with the Shafi`ite\ninvited him to attack Khurasan. He therefore led an assault on\nKhurasan, and the Hanafite, thinking themselves to be safe from the\nTartars, opened the city gates for them. But the Tartars did not\nmake any distinction between Hanafite and Shafi`ite and killed\nwhoever fell to their hands. After killing most of its population\nthey took it in occupation. These very differences between the\nHanafite and the Shafi`ite opened for him the door of conquest upto\nIraq. Consequently, after conquering Khurasan his courage increased\nand in 656 A.H. he marched on Baghdad with two hundred thousand\nTartars. Al-Musta`sim Billah's army and the people of Baghdad\njointly faced them, but it was not in their power to stop this\ntorrent of calamity. The result was that the Tartars entered Baghdad\non the day of `Ashura' carrying with them bloodshed and ruin. They\nremained busy in killing for forty days. Rivers of blood flowed in\nthe streets and all the alleys were filled with dead bodies. Hundred\nof thousands of people were put to the sword while al-Musta`sim\nBillah was trampled to death under foot. Only those people who hid\nthemselves in wells or underground places and hid from their sight\ncould survive.

Even if it be so, it is not possible to ignore the\nhistorical fact that before this the `Abbasid Caliph an-Nasir\nLidini'llah had initiated the move for the attack on the Muslim\nareas. When the Khwarazm Shahs declined to acknowledge the authority\nof the Caliphate he had sent word to Chingiz Khan to march on\nKhwarazm, from which the Tartars had understood that there was no\nunity and co-operation among the Muslims. Thereafter the Hanafite\nhad sent for Hulagu Khan to crush the Shafi`ite as a consequence of\nwhich the Tartars secured control over Khurasan, and prepared the\nway to march towards Baghdad. In these circumstances to hold only\nIbn al-`Alqami responsible for the ruination of Baghdad and to\nignore the move of an-Nasir Lidini'llah and the dispute between the\nHanafite and the Shafi`ite would be covering up the facts, when in\nfact the cause for the ruin of Baghdad was this very conquest of\nKhurasan, whose real movers were the Hanafite inhabitants of the\nplace. It was by this conquest that Hulagu Khan had the courage to\nmarch on the centre of Islam; otherwise it cannot have been the\nresult of a single individual's message that he assaulted an old\ncapital like Baghdad, the awe of whose power and grandeur was seated\nin the hearts of a large part of the\nworld.]"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"To know hidden\nthings on a personal level is one thing, while to be gifted by Allah\nwith knowledge of any matter and to convey it to others is\ndifferent.
