*Admonishing his own companions \[about his companions and the
companions of the Prophet\]*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> في أصحابه وأصحاب رسول الله (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم)

Although Allah gives time to the oppressor, His catch would not spare
him. Allah watches him on the passage of his way and the position of
that which suffocates the throats.

By Allah in Whose power my life lies, these people (Mu'awiyah and his
men) will overcome you not because they have a better right than you but
because of their hastening towards the wrong with their leader and your
slowness about my right (to be followed).

> وَلَئِنْ أَمْهَلَ اللهُ الظَّالِمَ فَلَنْ يَفُوتَ أَخْذُهُ، وَهُوَ لَهُ بَالمِرْصَادِ عَلَى مَجَازِ طَرِيقِهِ،
> وَبِمَوْضعِ الشَّجَا مِنْ مَسَاغِ رِيقِهِ. أَمَا وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَيَظْهَرَنَّ هؤُلاَءِ الْقَوْمُ
> عَلَيْكُمْ، لَيْسَ لاِنَّهُمْ أَوْلَى بِالْحَقِّ مِنْكُمْ، وَلكِنْ لاِسْرَاعِهِمْ إِلَى بَاطِلِ صَاحِبِهِمْ،
> وَإِبْطَائِكُمْ عَنْ حَقِّي.

People are afraid of the oppression of their rulers while I fear the
oppression of my subjects. I called you for war but you did not come. I
warned you but you did not listen. I called you secretly as well as
openly, but you did not respond. I gave you sincere counsel, but you did
not accept it. Are you present like the absent, and slaves like masters?

I recite before you points of wisdom but you turn away from them, and I
advise you with far reaching advice but you disperse away from it. I
rouse you for *jihad* against the people of revolt but before I come to
the end of my speech, I see you disperse like the sons of
Saba. You return to your places and deceive one another by your
counsel. I straighten you in the morning but you are back to me in the
evening as curved as the back of a bow. The sraightener has become weary
while those to be straightened have become incorrigible.

> وَلَقَدْ أَصْبَحَتِ الاْمَمُ تَخَافُ ظُلْمَ رُعَاتِهَا، وَأَصْبَحْتُ أَخَافُ ظُلْمَ رَعِيَّتِي. اسْتَنْفَرْتُكُمْ
> لِلْجِهَادِ فَلَمْ تَنْفِرُوا، وَأَسْمَعْتُكُمْ فَلَمْ تَسْمَعُوا، وَدَعَوْتُكُمْ سِرّاً وَجَهْراً فَلَمْ
> تَسْتَجِيبُوا، وَنَصَحْتُ لَكُمْ فَلَمْ تَقْبَلُوا. شُهُودٌ كَغُيَّاب، وَعَبِيدٌ كَأَرْبَاب! أَتْلُوا عَلَيْكُمُ
> الْحِكَمَ فَتَنْفِرُونَ مِنْهَا، وَأَعِظُكُمْ بِالمَوْعِظَةِ الْبَالِغَةِ فَتَتَفَرَّقُونَ عَنْهَا، وَأَحُثُّكُمْ عَلَى
> جِهَادِ أَهْلِ الْبَغْيِ فَمَا آتِي عَلَى آخِرِ قَوْلي حَتَّى أَرَاكُمْ مُتفَرِّقِينَ أَيَادِيَ سَبَا،
> تَرْجِعُونَ إِلى مَجَالِسِكُمْ، وَتَتَخَادَعُونَ عَنْ مَوَاعِظِكُمْ، أُقَوِّمُكُمْ غُدْوَةً، وَتَرْجِعُونَ إِلَيَّ
> عَشِيَّةً، كَظَهْرِ الْحَنِيَّةِ، عَجَزَ الْمُقَوِّمُ، وَأَعْضَلَ الْمُقَوَّمُ .

O those whose bodies are present but whose wits are absent, whose wishes
are scattered, and whose rulers are afflicted by them. Your leader obeys
Allah but you disobey him while the leader of the people of Syria
(ash-Sham) disobeys Allah but they obey him. By Allah, I wish Mu'awiyah
exchanges with me like Dinars with Dirhams, so that he takes from me ten
of you and gives me one from them.

> أَيُّهَا الشَّاهِدةُ أَبْدَانُهُمْ، الْغَائِبَةُ عَنْهُمْ عُقُولُهُمْ، الْـمُخْتَلِفَةُ أَهْوَاؤُهُمْ، المُبْتَلَى
> بِهمْ أُمَرَاؤُهُمْ، صَاحِبُكُمْ يُطِيعُ اللهَ وَأَنْتُمْ تَعْصُونَهُ، وَصَاحِبُ أَهْلِ الشَّامِ يَعْصِي اللهَ
> وَهُمْ يُطِيعُونَهُ، لَوَدِدْتُ وَاللهِ أَنَّ مُعَاوِيَةَ صَارَفَني بِكُمْ صَرْفَ الدِّينَارِ بِالدِّرْهَمِ،
> فَأَخَذَ مِنِّي عَشَرَةً مِنْكُمْ وَأَعْطَانِي رَجُلاً مِنْهُمْ!

O people of Kufah, I have experienced in you three things and two
others: you are deaf in spite of having ears, dumb in spite of speaking,
and blind in spite of having eyes. You are neither true supporters in
combat nor dependable brothers in distress. Your hands may be soiled
with earth. O examples of those camels whose herdsman has disappeared,
if they are collected together from one side they disperse from the
other. By Allah, I see you in my imagination that if war becomes intense
and action is in full swing you would run away from the son of Abi Talib
like the woman who becomes naked in the front. I am certainly on clear
guidance from my Lord (Allah) and on the path of my Prophet and I am on
the right path which I adhere to regularly.

> يَاأَهْلَ الْكُوفَةِ، مُنِيتُ مِنْكُمْ بِثَلاَث وَاثنَتَيْنِ: صُمٌّ ذَوُوأَسْمَاع، وَبُكُمٌ ذَوُوكَلاَم، وَعُمْيٌ
> ذَوُوأَبْصَار، لاَ أَحْرَارُ صِدْق عِنْدَ اللِّقَاءِ، وَلاَ إِخْوَانُ ثِقَة عِنْدَ الْبَلاَءِ! تَرِبَتْ
> أَيْدِيكُمْ! يَا أَشْبَاهَ الاِْبِلِ غَابَ عَنْهَا رُعَاتُهَا! كُلَّمَا جُمِعَتْ مِنْ جَانِب تَفَرَّقَتْ مِنْ
> آخَرَ، وَاللهِ لَكَأَنِّي بِكُمْ فِيَما إخالُ : لَوْ حَمِسَ الْوَغَى، وَحَمِيَ الضِّرَابُ، قَدِ انْفَرَجْتُمْ
> عَنِ ابْنِ أَبي طَالِب انْفِرَاجَ الْمَرْأَةِ عَنْ قُبُلِهَا، وَإِنِّي لَعَلَى بَيِّنَة مِنْ رَبِّي، وَمِنْهَاج
> مِنْ نَبِيِّي، وَإِنِّي لَعَلَى الطَّرِيقِ الْوَاضِحِ أَلْقُطُهُ لَقْطاً.

## About the Household of the Holy Prophet

> أهل البيت وأصحاب رسول الله

Look at the people of the Prophet\'s family. Adhere to their direction.
Follow their footsteps because they would never let you out of guidance,
and never throw you into destruction. If they sit down, you sit down,
and if they rise up you rise up. Do not go ahead of them, as you would
thereby go astray and go not lag behind of them as you would thereby be
ruined.

> انْظُرُوا أَهْلَ بَيْتِ نَبِيِّكُمْ فَالْزَمُوا سَمْتَهُمْ، وَاتَّبِعُوا أَثَرَهُمْ فَلَنْ يُخْرِجُوكُمْ مِنْ هُدىً،
> وَلَنْ يُعِيدُوكُمْ فِي رَدىً، فَإِنْ لَبَدُوا فَالْبُدُوا، وَإِنْ نَهَضُوا فَانْهَضُوا، وَلاَ تَسْبِقُوهُمْ
> فَتَضِلُّوا، وَلاَ تَتَأَخَّرُوا عَنْهُمْ فَتَهْلِكُوا.

I have seen the companions of the Prophet but I do not find anyone
resembling them. They began the day with dust on the hair and face (in
hardship of life) and passed the night in prostration and standing in
prayers. Sometimes they put down their foreheads and sometimes their
cheeks. With the recollection of their resurrection it seemed as though
they stood on live coal. It seemed that in between their eyes there were
signs like knees of goats, resulting from long prostrations. When Allah
was mentioned their eyes flowed freely till their shirt collars were
drenched. They trembled for fear of punishment and hope of reward as the
tree trembles on the day of stormy wind.

> لَقَدْ رَأَيْتُ أَصْحَابَ مُحَمَّد (صلى الله عليه وآله)، فَمَا أَرَى أَحَداً يُشْبِهُهُمْ مِنْكُمْ!
> لَقَدْ كَانُوا يُصْبِحُونَ شُعْثاً غُبْراً، قَدْ بَاتُوا سُجّداً وَقِيَاماً، يُرَاوِحُونَ بَيْنَ جِبَاهِهِمْ
> وَخُدُودِهِمْ، وَيَقِفُونَ عَلَى مِثْلِ الْجَمْرِ مِنْ ذِكْرِ مَعَادِهِمْ! كَأَنَّ بَيْنَ أَعْيُنهِمْ رُكَبَ الْمِعْزَى
> مِنْ طُولِ سُجُودِهِمْ! إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللهُ هَمَلَتْ أَعْيُنُهُمْ حَتَّى تَبُلَّ جُيُوبَهُمْ، وَمَادُوا كَمَا
> يَمِيدُ الشَّجَرُ يَوْمَ الرِّيحِ الْعَاصِفِ، خَوْفاً مِنَ الْعِقَابِ، وَرَجَاءً لِلثَّوَابِ!

-  In the atmosphere
    that had been created soon after the Prophet the Ahlul Bayt (members
    of his family) had no course except to remain secluded as a result
    of which world has remained ignorant of their real qualities and
    unacquainted with their teachings and attainments, and to belittle
    them and keeping them away from authority has been considered as the
    greatest service to Islam. If \`Uthman\'s open misdeeds had not
    given a chance to the Muslims to wake up and open their eyes there
    would have been no question of allegiance to Amir al-mu\'minin and
    temporal authority would have retained the same course as it had so
    far followed. But all those who could be named for the purpose had
    no courage to come forward because of their own shortcomings while
    Mu\`awiyah was sitting in his capital away from the centre. In these
    circumstances there was none except Amir al-mu\'minin who could be
    looked at. Consequently people\'s eyes hovered around him and the
    same common people who, following the direction of the wind, had
    been swearing allegiance to others jumped at him for swearing
    allegiance. Nevertheless, this allegiance was not on the count that
    they regarded his Caliphate as from Allah and him as an Imam (Divine
    Leader) to obey whom was obligatory. It was rather under their own
    principles which were known as democratic or consultative. However,
    there was one group who was swearing allegiance to him as a
    religious obligation regarding his Caliphate as determined by Allah.
    Otherwise, the majority regarded him a ruler like the other Caliphs,
    and as regards precedence, on the fourth position, or at the level
    of the common men after the three caliphs. Since the people, the
    army, and the civil servants had been impressed by the beliefs and
    actions of the previous rulers and immersed in their ways whenever
    they found anything against their liking they fretted and frowned,
    evaded war and were ready to rise in disobedience and revolt.
    Further, just as among those who fought in jihad with the Prophet
    there were some seekers of this world and others of the next world,
    in the same way here too there was no dearth of worldly men who
    were, in appearance, with Amir al-mu\'minin but actually they had
    connections with Mu\`awiyah who has promised some of them positions
    and had extended to others temptation of wealth. To hold them as
    Shi\`ahs of Amir al-mu\'minin and to blame Shi\`ism for this reason
    is closing the eyes to facts, because the beliefs of these people
    would be the same as of those who regarded Amir al-mu\'minin fourth
    in the series. Ibn Abi\'l-Hadid throws light on the beliefs of these
    persons in clear words:\
    Whoever observes minutely the events during the period of Caliphate
    of Amir al-mu\'minin would know that Amir al-mu\'minin had been
    brought to bay because those who knew his real position were very
    few, and the swarming majority did not bear that belief about him
    which was obligatory to have. They gave precedence to the previous
    Caliphs over him and held that the criterion of precedence was
    Caliphate, and in this matter those coming later followed the
    predecessors, and argued that if the predecessors had not the
    knowledge that the previous Caliphs had precedence over Amir
    al-mu\'minin they would not have preferred them to him. Rather,
    these people knew and took Amir al-mu\'minin as a citizen and
    subject. Most of those who fought in his company did so on grounds
    of prestige or Arab partisanship, not on the ground of religion or
    belief. (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol.7,
    p.72)]
-  The progeny of
    Saba\' ibn Yashjub ibn Ya\`rub ibn Qahtan is known as the tribe of
    Saba\'. When these people began to falsify prophets then to shake
    them Allah sent to them a flood of water by which their gardens were
    submerged and they left their houses and property to settle down in
    different cities. This proverb arose out of this event and it is now
    applied wherever people so disperse that there can be no hope of
    their joining together again.]
