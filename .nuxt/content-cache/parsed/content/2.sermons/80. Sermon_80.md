*After the Battle of Jamal,*

*Concerning Women and their Shortcomings.*

> ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

> بعد فراغه من حرب الجمل، في ذم النساء

O people! Women are deficient in Faith, deficient in shares and
deficient in intelligence. As regards the deficiency in their Faith, it
is their abstention from prayers and fasting during their menstrual
period.

As regards deficiency in their intelligence it is because the evidence
of two women is equal to that of one man. As for the deficiency of their
shares that is because of their share in inheritance being half of men.
So beware of the evils of women. Be on your guard even from those of
them who are (reportedly) good. Do not obey them even in good things so
that they may not attract you to evils.

> مَعَاشِرَ النَّاسِ، إِنَّ النِّسَاءَ نَوَاقِصُ الاْيمَانِ، نَوَاقِصُ الْحُظُوظِ، نَوَاقِصُ الْعُقُولِ: فَأَمَّا
> نُقْصَانُ إِيمَانِهِنَّ فَقُعُودُهُنَّ عَنِ الصَّلاةِ وَالصِّيَامِ فِي أَيَّامِ حَيْضِهِنَّ، وَأَمَّا نُقْصَانُ
> عُقُولِهِنَّ فَشَهَادَةُ امْرَأَتَيْنِ مِنْهُنّ كَشَهَادَةِ الرَّجُلِ الْوَاحِدِ، وَأَمَّا نُقْصَانُ حُظُوظِهِنَّ
> فَمَوَارِيثُهُنَّ عَلَى الاْنْصَافِ مِنْ مَوارِيثِ الرِّجَالِ; فَاتَّقُوا شِرَارَ النِّسَاءِ، وَكُونُوا مِنْ
> خِيَارِهِنَّ عَلَى حَذَر، وَلاَتُطِيعُوهُنَّ فِي المَعْرُوفِ حَتَّى لاَ يَطْمَعْنَ فِي المُنكَرِ.

-  Amir al-mu\'minin
    delivered this sermon after the devastation created by the Battle of
    Jamal. Since the devastation resulting from this battle was the
    outcome of blindly following a woman\'s command, in this sermon he
    has described women\'s physical defects and their causes and
    effects. Thus their first weakness is that for a few days in every
    month they have to abstain from prayer and fasting, and this
    abstention from worship is a proof of their deficiency in Faith.
    Although the real meaning of \`iman (belief) is heart-felt testimony
    and inner conviction yet metaphorically it also applies to action
    and character. Since actions are the reflection of Belief they are
    also regarded as part of Belief. Thus, it is related from Imam \`Ali
    ibn Musa ar-Rida (p.b.u.t.) that:\
    \`iman (belief) is testimony at heart, admission by the tongue and
    action by the limbs.\
    The second weakness is that their natural propensities do not admit
    of full performance of their intelligence. Therefore, nature has
    given them the power of intelligence only in accordance with the
    scope of their activities which can guide them in pregnancy,
    delivery, child nursing, child care and house-hold affairs. On the
    basis of this weakness of mind and intelligence their evidence has
    not been accorded the status of man\'s evidence, as Allah says: . .
    . then call to witness two witnesses from among your men and if
    there not be two men then (take) a man and two women, of those ye
    approve of the witnesses, so that should one of the two (women)
    forget the (second) one of the two may remind the other\...
    (Qur\'an, 2:282)\
    The third weakness is that their share in inheritance is half of
    man\'s share in inheritance as the Qur\'an says: Allah enjoineth you
    about your children. The male shall have the equal of the shares of
    two females\...(4:11)\
    This shows woman\'s weakness because the reason for her share in
    inheritance being half is that the liability of her maintenance
    rests on man. When man\'s position is that of a maintainer and care
    taker the status of the weaker sex who is in need of maintenance and
    care-taking is evident.\
    After describing their natural weakness, Amir al-mu\'minin points
    out the mischief of blindly following them and wrongly obeying them.
    He says that not to say of bad things but even if they say in regard
    to some good things it should not be done in a way that these should
    feel as if it is being done in pursuance of their wish, but rather
    in a way that they should realise that the good act has been
    performed because of its being good and that their pleasure or wish
    has nothing to do with it. If they have even the doubt that their
    pleasures has been kept in view in it they would slowly increase in
    their demands and would wish that they should be obeyed in all
    matters however evil, the inevitable consequence whereof will be
    destruction and ruin. ash-Shaykh Muhammad \`Abduh writes about this
    view of Amir al-mu\'minin as under: Amir al-mu\'minin has said a
    thing which is corroborated by experiences of
    centuries.]
