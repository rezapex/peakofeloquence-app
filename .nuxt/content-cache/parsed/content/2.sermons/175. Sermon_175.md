*Warning to neglectful people, and about the vastness of his own
knowledge*

> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام)

> في الموعظة وبيان قرباه من رسول الله

O people who are (negligent of Allah but) not neglected (by Allah), and
those who miss (doing good acts) but are to be caught. How is it that I
see you becoming removed from Allah and becoming interested in others?
You are like the camel whom the grazer drives to a disease-stricken
pasture and a disastrous watering place. They are like beasts who are
fed in order to be slaughtered, but they do not know what is intended
for them. When they are treated well they think that day to be their
whole life, and eating their full to be their aim.

> أَيُّهَا الغَافِلُونَ غَيْرُ الْمَغْفُولِ عَنْهُمْ، وَالتَّارِكُونَ الْمَأْخُوذُ مِنْهُمْ، مَالي أَرَاكُمْ عَنِ
> اللهِ ذَاهِبِينَ، وَإِلَى غَيْرِهِ رَاغِبِينَ! كَأَنَّكُمْ نَعَمٌ أَرَاحَ بِهَا سَائِمٌ إلَى مَرْعىً وبيّ،
> وَمَشْرَب دَوِيّ، وَإنَّمَا هِيَ كَالْمَعْلُوفَةِ لِلْمُدَى لاَ تَعْرِفُ مَاذَا يُرَادُ بِهَا! إذَا أُحْسِنَ
> إلَيْهَا تَحْسَبُ يَوْمَهَا دَهْرَهَا، وَشِبَعَهَا أَمْرَهَا

By Allah, if I wish, I can tell every one of you from where he has come,
where he has to go and all his affairs, but I fear lest you abandon the
Messenger of Allah - peace and blessing of Allah be upon him and his
progeny - in my favour. I shall certainly convey these things to the
selected ones who will remain safe from that fear. By Allah, Who deputed
the Prophet with Right and distinguished him over creation. I do not
speak save the truth. He (the Prophet) informed me of all this and also
about the death of every one who dies, the salvation of every one who is
granted salvation, and the consequences of this matter (the caliphate).
He left nothing (that could) pass into my head without putting it in my
ear and telling me about it.

> وَاللهِ لَوْ شِئْتُ أَنْ أُخْبِرَ كُلَّ رَجُل مِنْكُمْ بِمَخْرَجِهِ وَمَوْلِجِهِ وَجَمِيعِ شَأْنِهِ لَفَعَلْتُ، وَلكِنْ
> أَخَافُ أَنْ تَكْفُرُوا فيَّ بِرَسُولِ اللهِ (صلى الله عليه وآله). أَلاَ وَإِنِّي مُفْضِيهِ إلَى
> الْخَاصَّةِ مِمَّنْ يُؤْمَنُ ذلِكَ مِنْهُ. وَالَّذِي بَعَثَهُ بِالحَقِّ، وَاصْطَفَاهُ عَلَى الْخَلْقِ، مَا أَنْطِقُ
> إلاَّ صَادِقاً، وَقَدْ عَهِدَ إِلَيَّ بِذلِكَ كُلِّهِ، وَبِمَهْلِكِ مَنْ يَهْلِكُ، وَمَنْجَى مَنْ يَنْجُو، وَمَآلِ
> هذَا الاْمْرِ، وَمَا أَبْقَى شَيْئاً يَمُرُّ عَلَى رَأْسِي ألاَّ أَفْرَغَهُ فِي أُذُنَيَّ وَأَفْضَى بِهِ إِلَيَّ.

O people! By Allah, I do not impel you to any obedience unless I
practise it before you and do not restrain you from any disobedience
unless I desist from it before you.

> أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، إِنِّي، وَاللهِ، مَا أَحُثُّكُمْ عَلَى طَاعَة إِلاَّ وَأَسْبِقُكُمْ إِلَيْهَا، وَلاَ أَنْهَا
> كُمْ عَنْ مَعْصِيَة إِلاَّ وَأَتَنَاهَى قَبْلَكُمْ عَنْهَا.

-  Those who drink
    from the springs of revelation and divine inspiration see things
    hidden behind the curtains of the unknown and the events which will
    occur in the future in the same way as objects can be seen with the
    eyes, and this does not conflict with the saying of Allah that:\
    Say: \"None (either) in the heavens or in the earth knoweth the
    unseen save Allah\...\" (Qur\'an, 27:65)\
    because this verse contains the negation of personal knowledge of
    the unknown, but not the negation of knowledge which is required by
    the prophets and holy persons through divine inspiration, by virtue
    of which they make prophesies about the future and unveil many
    events and happenings. Several verses of the Qur\'an support this
    view such as:\
    When the Prophet confided unto one of his wives a matter, but when
    she divulged it (unto others) and Allah apprised him thereof, he
    made known a part of it and avoided a part; so when he informed her
    of it, said she: \"Who informed thee of this?\" He said: \"Informed
    me, the All-knowing, the All-aware.\" (Qur\'an, 66:3)\
    These are of the tidings of the unseen which We reveal unto thee
    (O\' Our Prophet Muhammad )\...(Qur\'an, 11:49)\
    Therefore, it is incorrect to argue in support of the view that if
    it is said that the prophets and holy persons possess knowledge of
    the unknown it would imply duality in the divine attributes. It
    would have implied duality if it were said that someone other than
    Allah has personal knowledge of the unknown. When it is not so and
    the knowledge possessed by the Prophets and Imams is that given by
    Allah it has no connection with duality. If duality should mean what
    is alleged, what would be the position of \`Isa\'s (Jesus\'s)
    assertion related in the Qur\'an namely:\
    . . . Out of clay will I make for you like the figure of a bird, and
    I will breathe into it, and it shall become a flying bird by
    Allah\'s permission; and I shall heal the blind and the leper and
    will rise the dead to life by Allah \'s permission; and I will
    declare to you what ye eat and what ye store up in your houses. . .
    (Qur\'an, 3 :49)\
    If it is believed that \`Isa (Jesus) could create and bestow life
    with Allah\'s permission does it mean that he was Allah\'s partner
    in the attributes of creation and revival? If this is not so then
    how can it be held that if Allah gives someone the knowledge of the
    unknown it implies that he has been taken to be His partner in His
    attributes, and how can one extol one\'s belief in the oneness of
    Allah by holding that the knowledge of the unknown implies duality.\
    No one can deny the fact that some people either see in dreams
    certain things which have yet to occur in the future, or that things
    can be read through interpretation of the dream, while during a
    dream neither do the senses function nor do the powers of
    understanding and comprehension co-operate. Therefore, if some
    events become known to some people in wakefulness why should there
    be amazement over it and what are the grounds for rejecting it, when
    it stands to reason that things possible in dreams are also possible
    in wakefulness. Thus, Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani has written that it is
    possible to achieve all this, because in a dream the spirit becomes
    free from looking after the body and is removed from bodily
    connections; as a result of this it perceives such hidden realities
    which could not be seen because of the obstruction of the body. In
    the same way those perfect beings who pay no heed to bodily matters,
    and turn with all the attention of spirit and heart towards the
    centre of knowledge can see those realities and secrets which the
    ordinary eyes are unable to discern. Therefore, keeping in view the
    spiritual greatness of Ahlul Bayt (members of the Prophet\'s family)
    it should not appear strange that they were aware of events which
    were going to occur in future. Ibn Khaldun has written:\
    \"When thaumaturgic feats are performed by others what do you think
    about those who were distinguished in knowledge and honesty and were
    a mirror of the Prophet\'s traits, while the consideration Allah had
    for their noble root (namely the Prophet) is a proof of the high
    performances of his chaste off-shoots (Ahlul Bayt). Consequently
    many events about knowledge of the unknown are related about Ahlul
    Bayt which are not related about others..\" (al-Muqaddamah, p. 23).\
    In this way there is no cause for wonder over Amir al-mu\'minin\'s
    claim since he was brought up by the Prophet and was a pupil of
    Allah\'s school. Of course, those whose knowledge does not extend
    beyond the limits of physical objectivity and whose means of
    learning are confined to the bodily senses refuse to believe in the
    knowledge about the paths of divine cognisance and reality. If this
    kind of claim were unique and were heard only from over Amir
    al-mu\'minin then minds could have wavered and temperaments could
    have hesitated in accepting it, but if the Qur\'an records even such
    a claim of \`Isa (Jesus) that - \"I can tell you what you eat or
    drink or store in your houses,\" then why should there be hesitation
    over Amir al-mu\'minin\'s claim, when it is agreed that Amir
    al-mu\'minin had succeeded to all the attainments and distinctions
    of the Prophet and it cannot be contended that the Prophet did not
    know what \`Isa (Jesus) knew. Thus, if the successor of the Prophet
    advances such a claim, why should it be rejected, particularly as
    this vastness of knowledge of Amir al-mu\'minin is the best evidence
    and proof for the Prophet\'s knowledge and perfection and a living
    miracle of his truthfulness.\
    In this connection, it is amazing that even having knowledge of
    events Amir al-mu\'minin did not, through any of his words or deeds,
    indicate that he knew them. Thus, commenting of the extraordinary
    importance of this claim, as-Sayyid Ibn Tawus writes: \"An amazing
    aspect of this claim is that despite the fact that Amir al-mu\'minin
    was aware of conditions and events, yet he observed such conduct by
    way of his words and deeds that one who saw him could not believe
    that he knew the secrets and unknown acts of others, because the
    wise agree that if a person knows what event is likely to take place
    or what step his comrade is going to take, or if the hidden secrets
    of people are known to him, then the effects of such knowledge would
    appear through his movements and the expressions of his face. But
    the man who, in spite of knowing everything, behaves in a way as
    though he is unaware and knows nothing, then his personality is a
    miracle and a combination of contradictions.\"\
    At this stage, the question arises as to why Amir al-mu\'minin did
    not act upon the dictates of his secret knowledge. The reply to this
    is that the commands of the shari\`ah are based on apparent
    conditions. Otherwise secret knowledge is a kind of miracle and
    power which Allah grants to His prophets and Imams. Although the
    prophets and Imams possess this power always, they cannot make use
    of it at any time unless and until by the permission of Allah and on
    the proper occasion. For example, the verse quoted above about \`Isa
    (Jesus) which tells that he had the power to give life, to heal the
    blind and declare what one ate and stored in his house, etc., he
    (Jesus) did not used to practise this power on every thing or every
    corpse or everyone who met him. He used to practise this power only
    by the permission of Allah and on the proper occasion.\
    If prophets and other divines acted on the basis of their secret
    knowledge it would have meant serious dislocation and disturbance in
    the affairs of the people. For example, if a prophet or divine, on
    the basis of his secret knowledge, punishes a condemnable man by
    killing him, there would be great commotion and agitation among
    those who see it on the ground that he killed an innocent man. That
    is why Allah has not permitted the basing of conclusions on secret
    knowledge save in a few special cases, and has enjoined the
    following of observable factors. Thus, despite his being aware of
    the hypocrisy of some of the hypocrites, the Prophet extended to
    them the treatment that should be extended to a Muslim.\
    Now, there can be no scope for the objection that if Amir
    al-mu\'minin knew secret matters then why did he not act according
    to them because it has been shown that he was not obliged to act
    according to the requirements of his secret knowledge. Of course,
    where conditions so required he did disclose some matters for the
    purposes of preaching, admonishing, giving good tidings (of reward)
    or warning (against punishment), so that future events could be
    fore-closed. For example, Imam Ja\`far as-Sadiq (p.b.u.h.) informed
    Yahya ibn Zayd that if he went out he would be killed. Ibn Khaldun
    writes in this connection: \"It has been authentically related from
    Imam Ja\`far as-Sadiq that he used to apprise some of his relations
    of the events to befall them. For example, he warned his cousin
    Yahya ibn Zayd of being killed but he disobeyed him and went out and
    was killed in Juzajan.\" (al-Muqaddamah, p. 233).\
    Nevertheless, where there was apprehension that minds would get
    worried it was not at all disclosed. That is why in this sermon Amir
    al-mu\'minin avoided more details, in view of the fear that people
    would begin to regard him higher than the Prophet. Despite all this
    people did go astray about \`Isa (Jesus), and in the same way about
    Amir al-mu\'minin also they began to say all sorts of things and
    were misled into resorting to
    exaggeration.]
