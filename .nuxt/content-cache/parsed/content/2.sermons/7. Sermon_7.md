*About the hypocrites*

> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام)

> يذم فيها أتباع الشيطان

They have made Satan the master of their affairs, and he has
taken them as partners. He has laid eggs and hatched them in their
bosoms. He creeps and crawls in their laps. He sees through their eyes,
and speaks with their tongues. In this way he has led them to sinfulness
and adorned for them foul things like the action of one whom Satan has
made partner in his domain and speaks untruth through his tongue.

> اتَّخَذُوا الشَّيْطَانَ لاِمْرِهِمْ مِلاَكاً، وَاتَّخَذَهُمْ لَهُ أَشْرَاكاً، فَبَاضَ وَفَرَّخَ في صُدُورِهِمْ،
> وَدَبَّ وَدَرَجَ في حُجُورِهِمْ، فَنَظَرَ بِأَعْيُنِهِمْ، وَنَطَقَ بِأَلسِنَتِهِمْ، فَرَكِبَ بِهِمُ الزَّلَلَ، وَزَيَّنَ
> لَهُمُ الخَطَلَ، فِعْلَ مَنْ قَدْ شَرِكَهُ الشَّيْطَانُ في سُلْطَانِهِ، وَنَطَقَ بِالبَاطِلِ عَلى لِسَانِهِ!

-  Amir al-mu\'minin
    says about the hypocrites (i.e. those who opposed him before and
    during his Caliphate) that they are partners in action of Satan and
    his helpers and supporters. He too has befriended them so much that
    he has made his abode with them, resides on their bosoms, lays eggs
    and hatches young ones from them there, while these young ones jump
    and play in their laps without demur. He means that Satanic evil
    ideas take birth in their bosoms and grow and thrive there. There is
    no restraint on them, nor restriction of any
    kind.]

    He has so permeated in their blood and mingled in their spirit that
    both have become completely unified. Now eyes are theirs but sight
    is his, the tongue is theirs but the words are his, as the Prophet
    had said, \"Verily, Satan permeates the progeny of Adam like
    blood.\" That is, just as the circulation of blood does not stop, in
    the same way the quick succession of Satan\'s evil ideas know no
    break and he draws man towards evil in sleep and wakefulness, and in
    every posture, rising or sitting. He so paints them with his dye
    that their word and action reflect an exact portrait of his word and
    action. Those whose bosoms shine with the effulgence of faith
    prevent such evil ideas but some are already ready to welcome those
    evils and these are the persons who under the garb of Islam are ever
    after advancement of heresy.
