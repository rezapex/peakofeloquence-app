*About the condition of the people at the time of the Prophet\'s
proclamation and his actions to do with the dissemination of his
message*

> ومن خطبة له (عليه السلام)

> يقرر فضيلة الرسول الكريم

Allah sent the Prophet at a time when the people were going astray in
perplexity and were moving here and there in mischief. Desires had
deflected them and self-conceit had swerved them. Extreme ignorance had
made them foolish. They were confounded by the unsteadiness of matters
and the evils of ignorance. Then the Prophet - blessing of Allah be upon
him and his descendants - did his best in giving them sincere advice,
himself trod on the right path and called (them) towards wisdom and good
counsel.

> بَعَثَهُ وَالنَّاسُ ضُلاَّلٌ فِي حَيْرَة، وَحَاطِبُونَ فِي فِتْنَة، قَدِ اسْتَهْوَتْهُمُ الاْهْوَاءُ،
> وَاسْتَزَلَّتْهُمُ الْكِبْرِيَاءُ، وَاسْتَخَفَّتْهُمُ الْجَاهِلِيِّةُ الْجَهْلاَءُ: حَيَارَى فِي زَلْزَال مَنَ
> الاْمْرِ، وَبَلاَء مِنَ الْجَهْلِ، فَبَالَغَ (صلى الله عليه وآله) فِي النَّصِيحَةِ، وَمَضَى عَلَى
> الطَّرِيقَةِ، وَدَعَا إِلَى الْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ.
