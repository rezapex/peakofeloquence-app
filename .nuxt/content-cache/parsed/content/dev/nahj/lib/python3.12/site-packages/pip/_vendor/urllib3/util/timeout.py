Other factors that can affect total request time include\n        high CPU load, high swap, the program running at a low priority level,\n        or other behaviors.\n\n        In addition, the read and total timeouts only measure the time between\n        read operations on the socket connecting the client and the server,\n        not the total amount of time for the request to return a complete\n        response. For most requests, the timeout is raised because the server\n        has not sent the first byte in the specified time. This is not always\n        the case; if a server streams one byte every fifteen seconds, a timeout\n        of 20 seconds will not trigger, even though the request will take\n        several minutes to complete.\n\n        If your goal is to cut off any request after a set amount of wall clock\n        time, consider having a second \"watcher\" thread to cut off a slow\n        request.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    #: A sentinel object representing the default timeout value\n    DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = _GLOBAL_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT\n\n    def __init__(self, total=None, connect=_Default, read=_Default):\n        self._connect = self._validate_timeout(connect, \"connect\")\n        self._read = self._validate_timeout(read, \"read\")\n        self.total = self._validate_timeout(total, \"total\")\n        self._start_connect = None\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return \"%s(connect=%r, read=%r, total=%r)\" % (\n            type(self).__name__,\n            self._connect,\n            self._read,\n            self.total,\n        )\n\n    # __str__ provided for backwards compatibility\n    __str__ = __repr__\n\n    @classmethod\n    def resolve_default_timeout(cls, timeout):\n        return getdefaulttimeout() if timeout is cls.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT else timeout\n\n    @classmethod\n    def _validate_timeout(cls, value, name):\n        \"\"\"Check that a timeout attribute is valid.\n\n        :param value: The timeout value to validate\n        :param name: The name of the timeout attribute to validate.
