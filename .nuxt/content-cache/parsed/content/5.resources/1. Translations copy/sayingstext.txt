During civil disturbance adopt such an attitude that people do not attach any importance to \nyou - they neither burden you with complicated affairs, nor try to derive any advantage out of \nyou. \n2. He who is greedy is disgraced; he who discloses his hardship will always be humiliated; he \nwho has no control over his tongue will often have to face discomfort. \n3. Avarice is disgrace; cowardice is a defect; poverty often disables an intelligent man from \narguing his case; a poor man is a stranger in his own town; misfortune and helplessness are \ncalamities; patience is a kind of bravery; to sever attachments with the wicked world is the \ngreatest wealth; piety is the best weapon of defence. \n4. Submission to Allah's Will is the best companion; wisdom is the noblest heritage; \ntheoretical and practical knowledge are the best signs of distinction; deep thinking will \npresent the clearest picture of every problem. \n5. The mind of a wise man is the safest custody of secrets; cheerfulness is the key to \nfriendship; patience and forbearance will conceal many defects. \n6. A conceited and self-admiring person is disliked by others; charity and alms are the best \nremedy for ailments and calamities; one has to account in the next world for the deeds that he \nhas done in this world. \n7. Man is a wonderful creature; he sees through the layers of fat (eyes), hears through a bone \n(ears) and speaks through a lump of flesh (tongue). \n8. When this world favors somebody, it lends him the attributes, and surpassing merits of \nothers and when it turns its face away from him it snatches away even his own excellences \nand fame. \n9. Live amongst people in such a manner that if you die they weep over you and if you are \nalive they crave for your company. \n10. If you overpower your enemy, then pardon him by way of thankfulness to Allah, for being \nable to subdue him. \n11. Unfortunate is he who cannot gain a few sincere friends during his life and more \nunfortunate is the one who has gained them and then lost them (through his deeds). \n12. When some blessings come to you, do not drive them away through thanklessness. \n13. He who is deserted by friends and relatives will often find help and sympathy from \nstrangers. \n14. Every person who is tempted to go astray, does not deserve punishment. \n15. Our affairs are attached to the destiny decreed by Allah, even our best plans may lead us \nto destruction. \n16. There is a tradition of the Holy Prophet \"With the help of hair-dye turn old age into youth \nso that you do not resemble the Jews\". When Imam Ali was asked to comment on this \ntradition, he said that in the early stage of Islam there were very few Muslims. The Holy \nProphet advised them to look young and energetic and not to adopt the fashion of the Jews \n(priest) having long, white flowing beards. But the Muslims were not in minority then, theirs \nwas a strong and powerful State, they could take up any style they liked. \n17. For those who refused to side with any party, Imam Ali or his enemies, Imam Ali said: \nThey have forsaken religion and are of no use to infidelity also. \n18. One who rushes madly after inordinate desire, runs the risk of encountering destruction \nand death. \n19. Overlook and forgive the weaknesses of the generous people because if they fall down, \nAllah will help them. \n20. Failures are often the results of timidity and fears; disappointments are the results of \nbashfulness; hours of leisure pass away like summer-clouds, therefore, do not waste \nopportunity of doing good. \n21. If the right usurped from us is given back to us we shall take it, otherwise we shall go on \nclaiming it. \n22. If someone's deeds lower his position, his pedigree cannot elevate it. \n23. To render relief to the distressed and to help the oppressed make amends for great sins. \n24. O son of Adam, when you see that your Lord, the Glorified, bestows His Favors on you \nwhile you disobey Him, you should fear Him (take warning that His Wrath may not turn those \nvery blessings into misfortunes). \n25. Often your utterances and expressions of your face leak out the secrets of your hidden \nthoughts. \n26. When you get ill do not get nervous about it and try as much as possible to be hopeful. \n27. The best form of devotion to the service of Allah is not to make a show of it. \n28. When you have to depart from this world and have to meet death (eventually), then why \nwish delay (why feel nervous about death). \n29. Take warning ! He has not exposed so many of your sinful activities that it appears as if \nHe has forgiven you (it may be that He has given you time to repent). \n30. When Imam Ali was asked about Faith in Religion, he replied that the structure of faith is \nsupported by four pillars endurance, conviction, justice and jihad. \nEndurance is composed of four attributes: eagerness, fear, piety and anticipation (of death). so \nwhoever is eager for Paradise will ignore temptations; whoever fears the fire of Hell will \nabstain from sins; whoever practices piety will easily bear the difficulties of life and whoever \nanticipates death will hasten towards good deeds. \nConviction has also four aspects to guard oneself against infatuations of sin; to search for \nexplanation of truth through knowledge; to gain lessons from instructive things and to follow \nthe precedent of the past people, because whoever wants to guard himself against vices and \nsins will have to search for the true causes of infatuation and the true ways of combating them \nout and to find those true ways one has to search them with the help of knowledge, whoever \ngets fully acquainted with various branches of knowledge will take lessons from life and \nwhoever tries to take lessons from life is actually engaged in the study of the causes of rise \nand fall of previous civilizations . \nJustice also has four aspects depth of understanding, profoundness of knowledge, fairness of \njudgment and dearness of mind; because whoever tries his best to under- stand a problem will \nhave to study it, whoever has the practice of studying the subject \nhe is to deal with, will \ndevelop a clear mind and will always come to correct decisions, whoever tries to achieve all \nthis will have to develop ample patience and forbearance and whoever does this has done \njustice to the cause of religion and has led a life of good repute and fame. \nJihad is divided into four branches: to persuade people to be obedient to Allah; to prohibit \nthem from sin and vice; to struggle (in the cause of Allah) sincerely and firmly on all \noccasions and to detest the vicious. Whoever persuades people to obey the orders of Allah \nprovides strength to the believers; whoever dissuades them from vices and sins humiliates the \nunbelievers; whoever struggles on all occasions discharges all his obligations and whoever \ndetests the vicious only for the sake of Allah, then Allah will take revenge on his enemies and \nwill be pleased with Him on the Day of Judgment. \n31. There are four causes of infidelity and loss of belief in Allah: hankering after whims, a \npassion to dispute every argument, deviation from truth; and dissension, because whoever \nhankers after whims does not incline towards truth; whoever keeps on disputing every \nargument on account of his ignorance, will always remain blind to truth, whoever deviates \nfrom truth because of ignorance, will always take good for evil and evil for good and he will \nalways remain intoxicated with misguidance. And whoever makes a breach (with Allah and \nHis Messenger) his path becomes difficult, his affairs will become complicated and his way to \nsalvation will be uncertain. \nSimilarly, doubt has also four aspects absurd reason- ing; fear; vacillation and hesitation; and \nunreasonable surrender to infidelity, because one who has accustomed himself to \nunreasonable and absurd discussions will never see the Light of Truth and will always live in \nthe darkness of ignorance. One who is afraid to face facts (of life, death and the life after \ndeath) will always turn away from ultimate reality, one who allows doubts and uncertainties \nto vacillate him will always be under the control of Satan and one who surrenders himself to \ninfidelity accepts damnation in both the worlds. \n32. A virtuous person is better then virtue and a vicious person is worse than vice. \n33. Be generous but not extravagant, be frugal but not miserly. \n34. The best kind of wealth is to give up inordinate desires. \n35. One who says unpleasant things about others, will himself quickly become a target of \ntheir scandal. \n36. One who hopes inordinately, impairs his deeds. \n37. When Imam Ali, marching at the head of his army towards Syria, reached Ambar, the \nlandlords of the place came out to meet him in zeal of their love, faithfulness and respect, no \nsooner had they seen Imam Ali they got down from their horses and started running in front \nof him. Imam Ali asked the reason of their strange actions. They replied that it was their \ncustom to show their love and respect in that way. Imam Ali replied: \"By Allah, by your \naction you do no good whatsoever to your rulers but you tire yourself and put yourself in toils \nin this world and in trouble in the next. How unfortunate is that exertion, which brings harm \nhere and in the Hereafter and how useful is that ease which keeps you in comfort in this world \nand away from the Hell in the next. \n38. Imam Ali once said to his son Imam Hasan, My son, learn four things from me and \nthrough them you will learn four more. If you keep them in mind your actions will not bring \nany harm to you: The greatest wealth is Wisdom; the greatest poverty is stupidity; the worst \nunso- ciableness is that of vanity and self-glorification; and the best nobility of descent \nexhibits itself in politeness and in refinement of manner. The next four things, my son, are: \n\"Do not make friendship with a fool because when he will try to do you good he will do you \nharm; do not make a miser your friend because he will run away from you at the time of your \ndire need; do not be friendly with a vicious and wicked person because he will sell you and \nyour friendship at the cheapest price and do not make friend of a liar because like a mirage he \nwill make you visualize very near the things which lie at a great distance and will make you \nsee at the great distance the things which are near to you\". \n39. Recommended prayers cannot attain the pleasures of Allah for you when obligatory \nprayers are left unattended. \n40. A wise man first thinks and then speaks and a fool speaks first and then thinks. \n41. A fool's mind is at the mercy of his tongue and a wise man's tongue is under the control of \nhis mind. \n42. One of the companions of Imam fell ill. Imam Ali called upon him and thus advised him: \n\"Be thankful to Allah. He has made this illness a thing to atone \nyour sins because a disease in \nitself has nothing to bring reward to anyone, it merely expiates one's sins and so far as reward \nis concerned, one has to earn it with his good words and good deeds. The Almighty Lord \ngrants Paradise to his creatures on account of their piety and noble thoughts\". \n43. May Allah Bless Kabbab bin Aratt. He embraced Islam of his own freewill and \nimmigrated (from Makkah) cheerfully. He lived a contented life. He bowed happily before the \nWill of Allah and he led the life of a mujahid. \n44. Blessed is the man who always kept the life after death in his view, who remembered the \nDay of Judgment through all his deeds, who led a contented life and who was happy with the \nlot that Allah had destined for him. 45. If I cut a faithful Muslim into pieces to make him hate \nme, he will not turn into my enemy and if I give all the wealth of this world to a hypocrite to \nmake him my friend he will not befriend me. It is so because the Holy Prophet has said: \" O \nAli! No faithful Muslim will ever be your enemy and no hypocrite will ever be your friend. \" \n46. The sin which makes you sad and repentant is more liked by Allah than the good deed \nwhich turns you arrogant. \n47. Value of a man depends upon his courage; his veracity depends upon his self-respect and \nhis chastity depends upon his sense of honor. \n48. Success is the result of foresight and resolution, foresight depends upon deep thinking and \nplanning and the most important factor of planning is to keep your secrets to yourself. \n49. Be afraid of a gentleman when he is hungry, and of a mean \nperson when his stomach is \nfull. \n50. Hearts of people are like wild beasts. They attach themselves to those who love and train \nthem. \n51. So long as fortune is favouring you, your defects will remain covered. \n52. Only he who has the power to punish can pardon. \n53. Generosity is to help a deserving person without his request, and if you help him after his \nrequest, then it is either out of self-respect or to avoid rebuke. \n54. There is no greater wealth than wisdom, no greater poverty than ignorance; no greater \nheritage than culture and no greater support than consultation. \n55. Patience is of two kinds: patience over what pains you, and patience against what you \ncovet. \n56. Wealth converts a strange land into homeland and poverty turns a native place into a \nstrange land. \n57. Contentment is the capital which will never diminish. \n58. Wealth is the fountain head of passions. \n59. Whoever warns you against sins and vices is like the one who gives you good tidings. \n60. Tongue is a beast, if it is let loose, it devours. \n61. Woman is a scorpion whose grip is sweet. \n62. If you are greeted then return the greetings more warmly. If you are favoured, then repay \nthe obligation manifold; but he who takes the initiative will always excel in merit. \n63. The source of success of a claimant is the mediator. \n64. People in this world are like travelers whose journey is going on though they are asleep. \n( Life's journey is going on though men may not feel it ). \n65. Lack of friends means, stranger in one's own country. \n66. Not to have a thing is less humiliating than to beg it. \n67. Do not feel ashamed if the amount of charity is small because to refuse the needy is an act \nof greater shame. \n68. To refrain from unlawful and impious source of pleasures is an ornament to the poor and \nto be thankful for the riches granted is the adornment of wealth. \n69. If you cannot get things as much as you desire than be contented with what you have. \n70. An ignorant person will always overdo a thing or neglect it totally. \n71. The wiser a man is, the less talkative will he be. \n72. Time wears out bodies, renews hopes, brings death nearer and takes away aspirations. \nWhoever gets anything from the world lives in anxiety for holding it and whoever loses \nanything passes his days grieving over the loss. \n73. Whoever wants to be a leader should educate himself before educating others. Before \npreaching to others he should first practice himself. Whoever educates himself and improves \nhis own morals is superior to the man who tries to teach and train others. \n74. Every breath you take is a step towards death. \n75. Anything which can be counted is finite and will come to an end. \n76. If matters get mixed up then scrutinize the cause and you will know what the effects will \nbe. \n77. Zirar bin Zamra Zibabi, known as Zirar Suda'i, was a companion of Imam Ali. When, \nafter the martyrdom of Imam Ali, he went to Damascus, Muawiya called him and asked him \nto say something about Imam Ali. Zirar, knowing that Muawiya hated Imam Ali intensely \ntried to avoid this topic, but Muawiya forced him to speak. Thereupon, Zirar said: \"O Amir, I \nhad often seen Imam Ali in the depth of nights, when people were either sleeping or \nengrossed in amusements, he would be standing in the niche of the Masjid, with tears in his \neyes and he would beseech Allah to help him maintain a pious, a virtuous and a noble \ncharacter and to forsake the world. He would then address the world, saying 'O vicious world! \nBe away from me, why do you come in front of me like this ? Do you want to allure me ? \nAllah forbid that I should be allured and tempted by you and your pleasures. It is not possible. \nGo and try your allurements on somebody else. I do not desire to own you and do not want to \nhave you. I have forsaken you thrice. It is like divorcing a woman thrice after which act she \ncannot be taken back as a wife. The life of pleasures that you offer is of a very little duration. \nThere is no real importance in what you offer, the desire of holding you is an insult and a \nhumiliation to sober minds. Sad is the plight of those who want to acquire you. They do not \nprovide for the Hereafter. They have to pass through a long journey over a very difficult road \ntowards a sat destination'. Zirar says that when he stopped, there were tears in the eyes of \nMuawiya who said, 'May peace of Allah be upon Abul Hasan Ali bin Abi Talib, he was \nundoubtedly like that. Now tell me, Zirar! How do you feel his separa- tion?' Zirar replied, \n\"My sorrow and grief is like that of woman whose only child has been murdered in her lap\". \nWith this remark Zirar walked out of the court of Muawiya and left \nthe city. \n78. After the Battle of Siffin, somebody asked Imam Ali whether they had been destined to \nfight against the Syrians. Imam Ali replied if by destiny you mean a compulsion (physical or \notherwise) through which we are forced (by nature) to do a thing then it is not so. Had it been \nan obligation of that kind there would have been no question of reward for doing it and \npunishment for not doing it (when you are physically forced to do a thing, like breathing, \nsleeping, eating, drinking etc. then there can be no reward for doing it and no retribution for \nnot doing it. In such cases nature forces you to do a thing and you cannot but do it), then the \npromised blessings and punishments in life after death will have no meaning. The Merciful \nLord has given his creatures (human beings) complete freedom to do as they like, and then \nprohibited them from certain actions and warned them of the consequences of such actions \n(His Wrath and His Punishments). These orders of Allah carry in them the least trouble and \nlead us towards the most convenient ways of life and the rewards which He has promised for \ngood deeds are many times more than the actions actually deserve. He sees people disobeying \nHim and tolerates them not because He can be overruled or be compelled to accept human \nsupremacy over Him. He did not send His prophets to amuse Himself or provide amuse- ment \nfor them. He did not reveal His orders without any genuine reason nor has He created the \ngalaxies and the earth without any purpose. The Universe without plan, purpose and program \nis the idea of infidels and the pagans, sorry will be their plight in the leaping fires of Hell. \nHearing this the man asked Imam Ali, \"Then what kind of destiny was it that we had?\" Imam \nAli replied: \"It was an order of Allah to do it like the order He has given in His Holy Book: \nYou are destined by Allah to worship none but Him, here 'destined' means 'ordered' it does \nnot mean physical compulsion\". \n79. Acquire wisdom and truth from whomever you can because even an apostate can have \nthem but unless they are passed over to a faithful Muslim and become part of wisdom and \ntruth that he possesses, they have a confused existence in the minds of apostates. \n80. Knowledge and wisdom are really the privilege of a faithful Muslim. If you have lost \nthem, get them back even though you may have to get them from the apostates. \n81. Value of each man depends upon the art and skill which he has attained. \n82. I want to teach you five of those things which deserve your greatest anxiety to acquire \nthem: Have hope only in Allah. Be afraid of nothing but sins. If you do not know a thing \nnever feel ashamed to admit ignorance. If you do not know a thing never hesitate or feel \nashamed to learn it. Acquire patience and endurance because their relation with true faith is \nthat of a head to a body, a body is of no use without a head, similarly true faith can be of no \nuse without attributes of resignation, endurance and patience. \n83. A man hypocritically started praising Imam Ali, though he had no faith in him and Imam \nAli hearing these praises from him said \"I am less than what you \ntell about me but more than \nwhat you think about me\". \n84. Those who have come alive out of a blood-bath live longer and have more children. \n85. One who imagines himself to be all-knowing will surely suffer on account of his \nignorance. \n86. I appreciate an old man's cautious opinion more than the valor of a young man. \n87. I wonder at a man who loses hope of salvation when the door of repentance is open for \nhim. \n88. Imam Muhammad Baqir says that Imam Ali once said: \"There were two things in this \nworld which softened the Wrath of Allah and prevented its descent upon man: One has been \ntaken away from you; hold the other stead- fastly. The one which has been taken away from \nmen is the Holy Prophet and the one which is still left with them and which they must hold \nsteadfastly is repentance and atonement for sins because Allah at one place in the Holy Book \naddressed the Holy Prophet and said Allah would not punish them while you were among \nthem nor while they were asking for forgiveness. (Surah Anfal, 8 : 33) \n89. Whoever keeps in order his affairs with Allah (follows His orders sincerely), Allah will \nalso put his affairs with men in order. Whoever makes arrangement for his salvation, Allah \nwill arrange his worldly affairs; whoever is a preacher for himself, Allah will also protect \nhim. \n90. He is the wisest and the most knowing man who advises people not to lose hope and faith \nin the Mercy of Allah and not to be too sure and over-confident of immunity from His Wrath \nand Punishment. \n91. Like your body your mind also gets tired so refresh it by wise sayings. \n92. That knowledge which remains only on your tongue is very superficial. The intrinsic \nvalue of knowledge is that you act upon it. \n93. Take care and do not pray to the Lord, saying, \"Lord! I pray to You to protect and guard \nme from temptations and trials\", for there is none who is not tempted and tried. But beseech \nHim to guard you against such temptation as may lead you towards wickedness and sins \nbecause Allah says in His Holy Book, Know that your wealth and children are temptations. \n(Surah al-Anfal, 8: 28) it means Allah tried people through wealth and children so that it may \nbe tested as to who is content with what he gets honestly and who is thankful to Allah for the \nposition he is placed in with regard to his children. Though Allah knows them better than \neven they know themselves, yet those trials and tests are for the purpose of their realizing and \nknowing those deeds which merit reward or which deserve punishment. There are some \npeople who love to have male children and hate daughters and there are some who simply \ncrave for wealth and hate poverty. \n94. Imam Ali was asked the meaning of being well-off or well-provided for. Imam Ali \nreplied, \"Your welfare does not lie in your having enormous wealth and numerous children \nbut it rests in your being highly educated and forbearing and in your being proud of your \nobedience to Allah. If you do a good deed then thank Allah for it and if you commit a sin then \nrepent and atone for it. In this world there is a real welfare for two kinds of people, one is the \nperson who, when commits a sin, atones for it and the other is anxious to do good as much as \npossible. \n95. Importance of the deeds that you have done with fear of Allah cannot be minimized and \nhow can the deeds which are acceptable to Allah be considered unimportant. \n96. \"Nearest to the prophets are those persons who have to those prophets and obey them\". \nSaying this, Imam Ali cited a passage from the Holy Qur'an 'Best liked by Abraham and \nnearest to him were the people who obeyed him'. He further said, \"That the present times are \nthe times of our Holy Prophet and his faithful followers. The best friend of our Holy Prophet \nis he who, though not related to him, obeys the orders of Allah and his greatest enemy is the \nman who though related to him, disobeys Allah '. \n97. Imam Ali was told of a Kharijite that he got up in the night to pray and recite the Holy \nBook. Imam Ali said, \"To sleep with having sincere faith in religion and Allah is better than \nto pray with wavering faith\". \n98. Whenever a tradition of the Holy Prophet is related to you, scrutinize it, do not be \nsatisfied with mere verbatim repetition of the same because there are many people who repeat \nthe words containing knowledge but only few ponder over them and try to fully grasp the \nmeaning they convey. \n99. Imam Ali heard somebody reciting the passage of the Holy \nQur'an we belong to Allah and \nour return is towards Him, Imam Ali said, \"How true it is ! Our declaring that we belong to \nAllah indicates that we accept Him as our Master, Owner and Lord. And when we say that \nour return is towards Allah indicates that we accept our mortality\". \n100. Some people praised Imam Ali on his face. He replied, \"Allah knows me very well and I \nalso know myself more than you. Please, Lord ! make me better than what they imagine me to \nbe and please excuse those Weaknesses of mine which they are not aware of\". \n101. To secure for you fame, credit as well as blessings, the help that you give to men in need, \nshould possess the following attributes: whatever its extent, it should be considered by you as \ntrifling so that it may be granted a high status; it should be given secretly, Allah will manifest \nit; and it must be given immediately so that it becomes pleasant. \n102. Your society will pass through a period when cunning and crafty intriguers will be \nfavoured by status, when profligates will be considered as well-bred, well-behaved and \nelegant elites of the society, when just and honest persons will be considered as weaklings, \nwhen charity will be considered as a loss to wealth and property, when support and help to \neach other will be considered as favour and benevolence and when prayers and worship to \nAllah will be taken up for the sake of show to gain popularity and higher status, at such times \nregimes will be run under the advice of women and the youngsters will be the rulers and \ncounselors of the State. \n103. Imam Ali's garment was very old with patches on it. When \nsomebody drew his attention \ntowards it, he replied, \" Such dresses, when worn by men of status make them submissive to \nAllah and kind-hearted towards others and the faithful Muslims can conveniently follow the \nexample \". Vicious pleasures of this world and salvation are like two enemies or two roads \nrunning in opposite directions or towards opposite poles, one to the North and the other to the \nSouth. Whoever likes to gain the pleasures and pomps of this world will hate austerity in life \nwhich is necessary to gain salvation. Reverse will be the attitude of a man desirous of \nachieving Eternal Bliss. One has to adopt either of the two ways of life, and as they both \ncannot be brought together, a man has to choose one of them. \n104. Nawf bin Fizala Bakali, the famous scholar of the early Islamic days says that one night \nhe was with Imam Ali. In the middle of the night, Imam Ali got up from his bed, looked for \nsometime at the stars and inquired of Nawf whether he was awake. Nawf said: \"I got from my \nbed replying, \"Yes, Amirul Mo'minin (Commander of the Faithful) ! I am awake\". \nImam Ali said Nawf ! Those are the fortunate people who adopt piety as the principle of their \nlives and are fully attentive to their welfare for the Hereafter. They accept bare earth as the \nmost comfortable bed and water as the most pleasant drink. They adopt the Holy Qur'an and \nprayers as their guide and protector and like Prophet Jesus Christ (Isa) they forsake the world \nand its vicious pleasure. \nNawf ! Prophet David (Daud) once got up at such an hour in the night and said this was the \nhour when prayers of everyone who prayed were accepted except of those who forcibly \ncollected revenues or who were scandal- mongers or were persons in the police force of a \ndespotic regime or were musicians\". \n105, Those who give up religion to better their lot in life seldom succeed. The Wrath of Allah \nmakes them go through more calamities and losses than the gains they gather for themselves. \n106. There are many educated people who have ruined their future on account of their \nignorance of religion. Their knowledge did not prove of any avail to them. \n107. More wonderful than man himself is that part of his body which is connected with his \ntrunk with muscles. It is his brain (mind). Look what good and bad tendencies arise from it. \nOn the one hand it holds treasures of know- ledge and wisdom and on the other it is found to \nharbour very ugly desires. If a man sees even a tiny gleam of success, then greed forces him \nto humiliate himself. If he gives way to avarice, then inordinate desires ruin him, if he is \ndisappointed, then despondency almost kills him. If he is excited, then he loses temper and \ngets angry. If he is pleased, then he gives up precaution. Sudden fear makes him dull and \nnervous, and he is unable to think and find a way out of the situation. During the times of \npeace and prosperity he becomes careless and unmindful of the future. If he acquires wealth, \nthen he becomes haughty and arrogant. If he is plunged in distress, then his agitation, \nimpatience and nervousness disgrace him. If he is overtaken by poverty, then he finds himself \nin a very sad plight, hunger makes him weak, and over-feeding harms him equally. In short \nevery kind of loss and gain makes his mind unbalanced. \n108. We, Ahlul Bayt (chosen descendants of the Holy Prophet), hold such central and \nbalancing position in religion that those who are deficient in understanding and acting upon \nits principles, will have to come to us for reformation, and those who are overdoing it have \ngot to learn moderation from us. \n109. A Divine rule can be established only by a man, who, where justice and equity are \nrequired, neither feels deficient nor weak and who is not greedy and avaricious. \n110. Sohayl bin Hunayf Ansari was a favourite companion of Imam Ali. At the time of Imam \nAli's return from Siffin, he died at Kufa of the wounds sustained in the battle. His death left \nImam Ali very sad and he said: \"Even if a mountain loves me it will be crushed into bits\". (it \nmeans people are tested with my love, and to prove it they have to pass through loss and \ncalamities). \n111. Anyone who loves us Ahlul Bayt must be ready to face a life of austerity. \n112. No wealth is more useful than intelligence and wisdom; no solitude is more horrible than \nwhen people avoid you on account of your vanity and conceit or when you wrongly consider \nyourself above everybody to confide and consult; no eminence is more exalting than piety; no \ncompanion can prove more useful than politeness; no heritage is better than culture; no leader \nis superior to Divine Guidance; no deal is more profitable than good deeds; no profit is \ngreater than Divine Reward; no abstinence is better than to restrain one's mind from doubts \n(about religion); no virtue is better than refraining from prohibited deeds; no knowledge is \nsuperior to deep thinking and prudence; no worship or prayers are more sacred than \nfulfillment of obligations and duties, no religious faith is loftier than feeling ashamed of doing \nwrong and bearing calamities patiently; no eminence is greater than to adopt humbleness; no \nexaltation is superior to knowledge; nothing is more respectable than forgiveness and forbearance; \nno support and defense are stronger than consultation. \n113. When a community is composed of honest, sober and virtuous people, your forming a \nbad opinion about anyone of its members, when nothing wicked has been seen of him, is a \ngreat injustice to him. On the contrary in a corrupt society to form good opinion of anyone of \nthem and to trust him is to harm yourself. \n114. When somebody asked Imam Ali as to how he was getting on, he replied: \"What do you \nwant to know about a person whose life is leading him towards ultimate death, whose health \nis the first stage towards illness and whom society has forced out of his retreat\". \n115. There are many persons whom constant grants of His Bounties turn them wicked and fit \nfor His punishment and there are many more who have become vain and self- deceptive \nbecause the Merciful Allah has not exposed their weaknesses and vices to the world and the \npeople speak highly about them. All this is an opportunity. No trial of the Lord is more severe \nthan the time He allows (in which either you may repent or get \ndeeper into vices). \n116. Two kinds of people will be damned on my account Those who form exaggerated \nopinion about me and those who under-estimate me because they hate me. \n117. To lose or to waste an opportunity will result in grief and sorrow. \n118. She world is like a serpent, so soft to touch, but so full of lethal poison. Unwise people \nare allured by it and drawn towards it, and wise men avoid it and keep away from its \npoisonous effects. \n119. When asked about Quraysh, Imam Ali replied that amongst them Bani Mukhzum are \nlike sweet scented flower of Quraysh; their men are good to talk to and their women prove \nvery good wives; Bani Abdush Shams are very intelligent and very prudent but we (of Bani \nHashim) are very generous and very brave to face death. Bani Abdush Shams are more in \nnumbers, ugly and intriguers but Bani Hashim are beautiful, good speakers and orators and \nvery faithful as friends. \n120. What a difference is there between a deed whose pleasure passes away leaving behind it \nthe pangs of pain and punishment and the deed whose oppressive harshness comes to an end \nleaving behind Divine rewards ! \n121. Imam Ali was following a funeral and as it was passing along a road, somebody laughed \nloudly ( a sign of discourtesy and lack of manner ). Hearing this laugh, Imam Ali remarked, \" \nSome of us feel that death is meant for everybody except themselves or it is destined to others \nand not to themselves or those whom we see dying around us are \nonly travelers going on a \njourney and will come back to us. It is a sad sight to see that in one moment we commit them \nto earth and in the next we take hold of the things left by them as if we are going to remain \npermanently in this world after them. The fact is that we forget sensible advice given to us \nand become victim of every calamity. \n122. Blessings are for the man who humbles himself before Allah, whose sources of income \nare honest, whose inten- tions are always honorable, whose character is noble, whose habits \nare sober, who gives away in the cause and in the Name of Allah, the wealth which is lying \nsurplus with him, who controls his tongue from vicious and useless talk, who abstains from \noppression, who faithfully follows the traditions of the Holy Prophet and who keeps himself \naway from innovation in religion. \n123. Jealousy in woman is unpardonable but in man it is a sign of his faith in religion \n(because Islam has permitted polygamy and prohibited polyandry). \n124. I define Islam for you in a way that nobody dared do it before me. Islam means \nobedience to Allah, obedience to Allah means having sincere faith in Him, such a faith means \nto believe in His Power, belief in His Power means recognizing and accepting His Majesty, \nacceptance of His Majesty means fulfilling the obligations laid down by Him and fulfillment \nof obligations means actions (Therefore, Islam does not mean mere faith, but faith plus \ndeeds). \n125. I wonder at the mentality of a miser, fearing poverty he takes \nto stinginess and thus \nhastily pushes himself head- long into a state of want and destitution, he madly desires plenty \nand ease, but throws it away without understand- ing. In this world he, of his own free will, \nleads the life of a a beggar and in the next world he will have to submit an account like the \nrich. \nI wonder at the arrogance of a haughty and vain person. Yesterday he was only a drop of \nsemen and tomorrow he will turn into a corpse. I wonder at the man who observes the \nUniverse created by Allah and doubts His Being and Existence. I wonder at the man who sees \npeople dying around him and yet he has forgotten his end. I wonder at the man who \nunderstands the marvel of genesis of creation and refuses to accept that he will be brought \nback to life again. I wonder at the man who takes great pains to decorate and to make \ncomfortable this mortal habitat and totally forgets his permanent abode. \n126. Whoever is not diligent in his work, will suffer; who- ever has no share of Allah in his \nwealth and in his life then there is no place for him in His Realm. \n127. Be very cautious of cold in the beginning of winter and welcome it at the close of the \nseason because cold season effects your bodies exactly as it effects the trees; in the early \nseason its severity makes them shrivel and shed their leaves and at the end it helps them to \nrevive. \n128. If you understand Allah's Majesty, then you will not attach any importance to the \ncreatures. \n129. While returning from Siffin, Imam Ali passed along the cemetery of Kufa. Addressing \nthe graves he said: \"O you, who are lying in horrible and deserted houses. O you, who are \nshut up in the dark graves, who are alone in their abodes, strangers to the places assigned to \nthem; you have gone ahead and preceded us, while we are also following your steps and shall \nshortly join you. Do you know what has happened aver you? Your houses and property was \ntaken up by others, your widows have remarried, this is what we can tell you of this world. \nCan you give us some news about things around you?\" Saying this, Imam Ali turned to his \ncompanions and said, \"If they are permitted to speak they will inform you that the best \nprovision for the next world is piety and virtue\". \n130. Imam Ali heard someone abusing and blaming the world and said to him, \"O you, who \nare blaming the world, who have been allured and enticed by it, and have been tempted by its \nfalse pretenses. You allowed yourself to be enamored of, to be captivated by it and then you \naccuse and blame it. Have you any reason or right to accuse it and to call it a sinner and \nseducer? Or is the world not justified in calling you a wicked knave and a sinning hypocrite? \nWhen did it make you lose your intelli- gence and reasoning? And how did it cheat you or \nsnake false pretenses to you? Did it conceal from you the fact of the ultimate end of \neverything that it holds, the fact of the sway of death, decay and destruction in its domain? \nDid it keep you in the dark about the fate of your fore- fathers and their final abode under the \nearth? Did it keep the resting-place of your mothers a secret from you? Do you not know that \nthey have returned to dust? Many a time you must have attended the sick persons and many of \nthem you must have seen beyond the scope of medicine. Neither the science of healing nor \ncould your nursing and attendance nor your prayers and weeping prolonged the span of their \nlives, and they died. You were anxious for them, you procured the best medical aid, you \ngathered famous physicians and provided best - medicines for them. Death could not be held \nback and life could not be pro- longed. In this drama and in this tragedy did the world not \npresent you with a lesson and a moral? \nCertainly, this world is a house of truth for those who look into it carefully, an abode of peace \nand rest for those who understand its ways and moods and it is the best working ground for \nthose who want to procure rewards for life in the Hereafter. It is a place of acquiring \nknowledge and wisdom for those who want to acquire them, a place of worship for the friends \nof Allah and for Angels. It is the place where prophets received revelations of Allah. It is the \nplace for virtuous people and saints to do good deeds and to be assigned with rewards for the \nsame. Only in this world they could trade with Allah's Favors and Blessings and only while \nliving here they could barter their good deeds with His Blessings and Rewards. Where else \ncould all this be done? Who are you to abuse the world when it has openly declared its \nmortality and mortality of everything connected with it, when it has given everyone of its \ninha- bitants to understand that all of them are to face death, when through its ways it has \ngiven them all an idea of calamities they have to face here, and through the sight of its \ntemporary and fading pleasures it has given them glimpses of eternal pleasures of Paradise \nand suggested them to wish and work for the same. If you study it properly you will find that \nsimply to warn and frighten you of the consequences of evil deeds and to persuade you \ntowards good actions, every night it raises new hopes of peace and prosperity in you and \nevery morning it places new anxieties and new worries before you. Those who passed such \nlives are ashamed of and repent the time so passed abuse this world. But there are people who \nwill praise this world on the Day of Judgment that it reminded them of the Hereafter and they \ntook advantage of these reminders. It informed them of the effects of good deeds and they \nmade correct use of the information it advised them and they were benefited by its advice\". \n131. An Angel announces daily: \"Birth of more human beings means so many more will die, \ncollection of more wealth means of much more will be destroyed, erection of more buildings \nmeans so many more ruins will come\". \n132. This world is not a permanent place, it is a passage, a road on which you are passing. \nThere are two kinds of people here: One is the kind of those who have sold their souls for \neternal damnation, the other is of those who have purchased their souls and freed them from \ndamnation. \n133. A friend cannot be considered a friend unless he is tested on \nthree occasions: in time of \nneed, behind your back and after your death. \n134. Anyone who has been granted four attributes will not be deprived of their (four) effects; \none who prays to Allah and implores to Him will not be deprived of granting of his prayers; \none who repents for his thoughts and deeds will not be refused acceptance of the repentance; \none who has atoned for his sins will not be debarred from salvation and one who thanks Allah \nfor the Blessings and Bounties will not be denied the increase in them. \nThe truth of these facts is attested by the Holy Qur'an As far as prayers are concerned He says \nPray to Me and I shall accept your prayers. About repentance He says: Whoever has done a \nbad deed or has indulged in sin and then repents and asks for His forgiveness will find Allah \nmost Forgiving and Merciful. About being thankful He says if you are thankful for what you \nare given, I shall increase My Bounties and Blessings. About atonement of sin He says Allah \naccepts the repentance of those who have ignorantly committed vice and then soon repent for \nit, Allah accepts such repentance's, He is Wise and Omniscient. 135. Daily prayers are the \nbest medium through which one can Seek the nearness to Allah. Hajj is Jihad (Holy War) for \nevery weak person. For everything that you own there is Zakat, and Zakat of your body is \nfasting. The Jihad of a woman is to afford pleasant company to her husband. \n136. If you want to pray to Allah for better means of subsistence, then first give something in \ncharity \n137. When someone is sure of the returns, then he shows generosity. \n138. Aid (from Allah) is in proportion to the trouble. \n139. He who practices moderation and frugality will never be threatened with poverty. \n140. One of the conveniences in life is to have less children. \n141. Loving one another is half of wisdom. \n142. Grief is half of old age. \n143. Grant of patience (from Allah) is in proportion to the extent of calamity you are passing \nthrough. If you exhibit fretfulness, irritation, and despair in calamities, then your patience and \nyour exertions are wasted. \n144. Many persons get nothing out of their fasts but hunger and thirst, many more get nothing \nout of their night prayers but exertions and sleepless nights. Wise and sagacious persons are \npraiseworthy even if they do not fast and sleep during the nights. \n145. Defend your faith (in Allah) with the help of charity. Protect your wealth with the aid of \nZakat. Let the prayers guard you from calamities and disasters. \n146. Kumayl bin Ziyad Nakha'i says that once Imam Ali put his hand in his hand and took me \nto the grave-yard. When he passed through it and left the city behind, he heaved a sigh and \nsaid \"Kumayl, these hearts are containers of the secrets of knowledge and wisdom and the \nbest container is the one which can hold the most and what it holds, it can preserve and \nprotect in the best way. Therefore, remember carefully what I am telling you. Remember that \nthere are three kinds of people: one kind is of those learned people who are highly versed in \nthe ethics of truth and philosophy of religion, second is the kind of those who are acquiring \nthe above knowledge and the third is that class of people who are uneducated. They follow \nevery pretender and accept every slogan, they have neither acquired any knowledge nor have \nthey secured any support of firm and rational convictions. Remember, Kumayl, knowledge is \nbetter than wealth because it protects you while you have to guard wealth. It decreases if you \nkeep on spending it but the more you make use of knowledge the more it increases. What you \nget through wealth dis- appears as soon as wealth disappears but what you achieve through \nknowledge will remain even after you. \nO Kumayl ! Knowledge is power and it can command obedience. A man of knowledge during \nhis lifetime can make people obey and follow him and he is praised and venerated after his \ndeath. Remember that knowledge is a ruler and wealth is its subject. \nO Kumayl ! Those who amass wealth, though alive, are dead to realities of life, and those \nwho achieve know- ledge, will remain alive through their knowledge and wisdom even after \ntheir death, though their faces may disappear from the community of living beings, yet their \nideas, the knowledge which they had left behind and their memory, will remain in the minds \nof people\". \nKumayl says that after this brief dissertation, Imam Ali pointed towards his chest and said, \n\"Look Kumayl! Here I hold stores and treasures of knowledge. I wish I could find somebody \nto share it with me. Yes, I found a few, but one of them, though quite intelligent, was \nuntrustworthy, he would sell his salvation to get hold of the world \nand its pleasures, he would \nmake religion a pretence to grasp worldly power and wealth, he would make this Blessing of \nAllah (knowledge) serve him to get supremacy and control over friends of Allah and he \nwould through knowledge exploit and suppress other human beings. The other person was \nsuch that he apparently obeyed truth and knowledge, yet his mind had not achieved the true \nlight of religion, at the slightest ambiguity or doubt he would get suspicious of truth, mistrust \nreligion and would rush towards skepticism. So neither of them was capable of acquiring the \nsuperior knowledge that I can impart. Besides these two I find some other person One of them \nis a slave of self and greedy for inordinate desires, which can easily drag him away from the \npath of religion, the other is an avaricious, grasping and acquisitive miser who will risk his \nlife to grasp and hold wealth, none of these two will be of any use to religion or man, both of \nthem resemble beasts having appetite for food. If sensible trustees of knowledge and wisdom \ntotally disappear from human society then both knowledge and wisdom will suffer severely, \nmay bring harm to humanity and may even die out. But this earth will never be without those \npersons who will prove the universality of truth as disclosed by Allah, they may be wellknown \npersons, openly and fearlessly declaring the things revealed to them or they may, \nunder fear of harm, injury or deaths hide themselves from the public gaze and may carry on \ntheir mission privately so that the reasons proving the reality of truth as preached by religion \nand as demonstrated by His Prophet may not totally disappear. How many are they and where \ncould they be found? I swear by Allah that they are very few in number but their worth and \ntheir ranks before Allah are very high. Through them Allah preserves His Guidance so that \nthey, while departing, may hand over these truths to persons like themselves. The knowledge \nwhich they have acquired has made them see the realities and visualize the truth and has \ninstilled into them the spirit of faith and trust. The duties which were decreed as hard and \nunbearable by them. They feel happy in the company and association of things which frighten \nthe ignorant and uneducated. They live in this world like everybody else but their souls soar \nto the heights of Divine Eminence. They are media of Allah on this earth and they invite \npeople towards Him. How I love to meet them O Kumayl ! I have told you all that I have to \nsay, you can go back to your place whenever you like\". \n147. A man can be valued through his sayings. \n148. One who does not realize his own value is condemned to utter failure. (Every kind of \ncomplex, superiority or inferiority is harmful to man). \n149. Somebody requested Imam Ali to advise him how to lead a useful and sober life. Imam \nAli thereupon advised him thus: \"Do not be among those people who want to gain good \nreturns without working hard for them, who have long hopes and keep on postponing \nrepentance and penance, who talk like pious persons but run after vicious pleasures. Do not be \namong those who are not satisfied if they get more in life and are not content if their lot in \nlife's pleasures is less (they are never satisfied), who never thank Allah for what they get and \nkeep on constantly demanding increase in what is left with them; who advise others to such \ngood deeds that they themselves refrain from; who appreciate good people but do not follow \ntheir ways of life; who hate bad and vicious people but follow their ways of life; who, on \naccount of their excessive sins hate death but do not give up the sinful ways of life; who, if \nfallen ill, repent their ways of life and on regaining their health fearlessly readopt the same \nfrivolous ways; who get despondent and lose all hopes, but on gaining health, become \narrogant and careless; who, if faced with misfor- tunes, dangers or afflictions, turn to Allah \nand keep on beseeching Him for relief and when relieved or favoured with comfort and ease \nthey are deceived by the comfortable conditions they found themselves in and forget Allah \nand forsake prayers; whose minds are allured by day dreams and forlorn hopes and who abhor \nto face realities of life; who fear for others the enormous repercussions of vices and sins but \nfor their own deeds expect very high rewards or very light disciplinary actions. Riches make \nsuch people arrogant, rebellious and wicked, and poverty makes them despondent and \nlethargic. If they have to work, they work lazily and if they put up a demand they do it \nstubbornly. \nUnder the influence of inordinate cravings, they commit sins in quick succession and keep on \npostponing repentance. Calamities and adversities make them give up the distinguished \ncharacteristics of Muslims (patience, hope in future and work for improvement of \ncircumstances). They advise people with narration's of events and facts but do not take any \nlesson from them. They are good at preachings but bad at practice, therefore they always talk \nof lofty deeds but their actions belie their words. They are keen to acquire temporal pleasures \nbut are careless and slow to achieve permanent (Divine) benefits. They think good for \nthemselves the things which are actually injurious to them and regard harmful the things \nwhich really benefit them. They are afraid of death but waste their time and do not resort to \ngood deeds before death overtakes them. The vices which they regard as enormous sins for \nothers, they consider as minor shortcomings for themselves. Similarly, they attach great \nimportance to their obedience to the orders of Allah and belittle similar actions in others. \nTherefore, they often criticize others and speak very highly of their own deeds. They are \nhappy to spend their time in society of rich persons, wasting it in luxuries and vices but are \naverse to employing for useful purposes in company of the poor and pious people: They are \nquick and free to pass verdicts against others but they never pass a verdict against their own \nvicious deeds. They force others to obey them but they never obey Allah. They collect their \ndues carefully but never pay the dues they owe. They are not afraid of Allah but fear powerful \nmen\". \n150. Everyone has an end, it may be pleasant or sorrowful. \n151. Everyone, who is born, has to die and once dead he is as \ngood as having not come into \nexistence. \n152. One, who adopts patience, will never be deprived of success though it may take a long \ntime to reach him. \n153. One who assents or subsribes to the actions of a group or a party is as good as having \ncommitted the deed himself. A man who joins a sinful deed makes himself responsible for \ntwo-fold punishments, one for doing the deed and the other for assenting and subscribing to it. \n154. Accept promises of only those persons who can stead- fastly-adhere to their pledges. \n155. You are ordained to recognize the Imams (the right successors of the Holy Prophet) and \nto obey them. \n156. You have been shown, if you only care to see; you have been advised if you care to take \nadvantage of advice; you have been told if you care to listen to good counsels. \n157. Admonish your brother (comrade) by good deeds and kind regards, and ward off his evil \nby favouring him. \n158. One, who enters the places of evil repute has no right to complain against a man who \nspeaks ill of him. \n159. One, who acquires power cannot avoid favouritism. \n160. One, who is willful and conceited will suffer losses and calamities and one who seeks \nadvice can secure advan- tages of many counsels. \n161. One, who guards his secrets has complete control over his affairs. \n162. Poverty is the worst form of death. \n163. One, who serves a person from whom he gets no reci- procal performance of duties, in \nfact, worships him. \n164. One should not obey anyone against the commands of Allah. \n165. Do not blame a man who delays in securing what are his just rights but blame lies on \nhim who grasps the rights which do not belong to him. \n166. Conceit is a barrier to progress and improvement. \n167. Death is near and our mutual company is short. \n168. There is enough light for one who wants to see. \n169. It is wiser to abstain then to repent. \n170. Often inordinate desire to secure a single gain acts as a hindrance for the quest of many \nprofitable pursuits. \n171. People often hate those things which they do not know or cannot understand. 172. One, \nwho seeks advice learns to realize his mistakes. \n173. One who struggles for the cause of Allah secures victory over His enemies. \n174. When you feel afraid or nervous to do a thing then do it because the real harm which you \nmay thus receive is less poignant than its expectation and fear. 175. Your supremacy over \nothers is in proportion to the extent of your knowledge and wisdom. \n176. The best way to punish an evil-doer is to reward handsomely a good person for his good \ndeeds. \n177. If you want to remove evil from the minds of others then first give up evil intentions \nyourself. \n178. Obstinacy will prevent you from a correct decision. \n179. Greed is permanent slavery. \n180. Deficiency will result in shame and sorrow but caution and foresight will bring peace \nand security. \n181. To keep silent when you can say something wise and useful \nis as bad as keeping on \npropagating foolish and unwise thoughts. \n182. If two opposite theories are propagated one will be wrong. \n183. When truth was revealed to me I never doubted it. \n184.I never lied and the things revealed to me were not false I never misled anybody nor was \nI misled. \n185. One, who starts tyranny, will repent soon. \n186. Death is never very far. \n187. One who forsakes truth earns eternal damnation. \n188. One who cannot benefit by patience will die in grief. \n189. In this world, man is a target of death, an easy prey to calamities, here every morsel and \nevery draught is liable to choke one, here one never receives a favour until he loses another \ninstead, here every additional day in one's life is a day reduced from the total span of his \nexistence, when death is the natural outcome of life, how can we expect immortality? \n190. O son of Adam, if you have collected anything in excess of your actual need, you will \nact only as its trustee for someone else to use it. \n191. Hearts have the tendency of likes and dislikes and are liable to be energetic and \nlethargic, therefore, make them work when they are energetic because if hearts are forced (to \ndo a thing) they will be blinded. \n192. When I feel angry with a person how and when should I satisfy my anger, whether at a \ntime when I am not in a position to retaliate and people may advise me to bear patiently or \nwhen I have power to punish and I forgive. 193. Minds get tired like bodies. When you feel \nthat your; mind is tired, then invigorate it with sober advice. \n194. If you find that somebody is not grateful for all that you have \ndone for him, then do not \nget disappointed because often you will find that someone else feels under your obligation \nthough you have done nothing for him and thus your good deeds will be compensated, and \nAllah will reward you for your goodness. \n195. The first fruit of forbearance is that people will sympathize with you and they will go \nagainst the man who offended you arrogantly. \n196. One who takes account of his shortcomings will always gain by it; one who is unmindful \nof them will always suffer. One who is afraid of the Day of Judgment, is safe from the Wrath \nof Allah. One who takes lessons from the events of life, gets vision, one who acquires vision \nbecomes wise and one who attains wisdom achieves knowledge. \n197. Bear sorrows and calamities patiently, otherwise you will never be happy. \n198. One who comes into power often oppresses. \n199. Adversities often bring good qualities to the front. \n200. If a friend envies you, then he is not a true friend. \n201. Avarice dulls the faculties of judgment and wisdom. \n202. Oppression and tyranny are the worse companions for the Hereafter. \n203. The best deed of a great man is to forgive and forget. \n204. Silence will create respect and dignity; justice and fairplay will bring more friends; \nbenevolence and charity will enhance prestige and position; courtesy will draw benevolence; \nservice of mankind will secure leadership and good words will overcome powerful enemies. \n205. A greedy man will always find himself in the shackles of humility. \n206. There are people who worship Allah to gain His Favors, this is the worship of traders; \nwhile there are some who worship Him to keep themselves free from His Wrath, this is the \nworship of slaves; a few who obey Him out' of their sense of gratitude and obligations, this is \nthe worship of free and noble men. \n  \n\n"},"hash":"BgRMfkYBKq"}
